I did that one time.,Ted
It was a blazer!,Barney
"You know, ever since college it's been Marshall and Lily and me. Now it's going to be Marshall and Lily... and me. They'll get married, start a family-before long I'm the weird, middle-aged bachelor their kids call Uncle Ted.",Ted

"Lesson two, get a suit. Suits are cool.  Exhibit A.  Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till you're... thirty.",Barney
"Thirty, right. You're right. I guess it's just, you're best friend gets engaged-you start thinking about that stuff.",Ted
"I thought I was your best friend. Ted, say I'm your best friend.",Barney
"You're my best friend, Barney.",Ted
"Good! And as your best friend, I suggest we play a little game called... Have you met Ted?",Barney

"Yes, I am.",Marshall
Aww- Are you sure that's a good idea after last time? You looked really creepy without eyebrows.,Lily
I can handle this; I'm full of surprises tonight.,Marshall
So there's more surprises? Like what?,Lily
"Marshall was in his second year of law school, so he was pretty good at thinking on his feet.",Narrator
BOOGITY BOO! And that's all of them! I'm goanna go... cook. ,Marshall
"I'm so happy for Marshall, I really am. I just couldn't imagine settling down right now.",Ted
So do you think you'll ever get married?,Yasmine
"Well maybe eventually. Some fall day. Possibly in Central Park. Simple ceremony, we'll write our own vows. But--eh--no DJ, people will dance. I'm not going to worry about it! Damn it, why did Marshall have to get engaged?  Yeah, nothing hotter than a guy planning out his own imaginary wedding, huh?",Ted
"Actually, I think it's cute.",Yasmine
"Well, you're clearly drunk  ONE MORE FOR THE LADY!",Ted
"Okay, look what I got ",Marshall
Aw-honey. Champagne! ,Lily

"No, you are too old to be scared to open a bottle of champagne!",Lily
I'm not scared.,Marshall
Then open it!,Lily
Fine  Please open it ,Marshall
"You are unbelievable, Marshall. No-",Lily
"There are two big questions a man has to ask in life. One you plan out for months, the other just slips out when you're half drunk at some bar.",Narrator
will you marry me?,Marshall
you wanna go out sometime?,Ted
"Of course, you idiot! ",Lily
I'm sorry; Carl's my boyfriend ,Yasmine

It's always been don't even think about it till you're thirty,Ted
Exactly-the guy doesn't even own a suit!,Barney
"Plus Marshall's found the love of his life. Even if I was ready, which I'm not, but if I was it's like, Okay, I'm ready! Where is she? ",Ted
and there she was.,Narrator
"It was like something from an old movie. Where the sailor sees the girl across the crowded dance floor, turns to his buddy and says, see that girl? I'm going to marry her someday",Narrator
"Hey Barney, see that girl?",Ted
"Hey, have you met Ted?",Barney
"Let me guess,  Ted?",Robin
"I'm sorry, Lily. I'm so sorry. Take us to the hospital.",Marshall
"Whoa, whoa, whoa-did you hit her?",Cabdriver
"Hit me? Please, this guy could barely even spank me in bed for fun. He's all like,  Oh, did that hurt? and I'm like, Come on, let me have it you pansy!  Wow, complete stranger.",Lily
"no, no, no, no-it's okay, go on.  So these, spankin's...you in pajamas or going naturelle",Cabdriver
So what do you do?,Ted
I'm a reporter for Metro News 1.,Robin
Oh.,Ted
"Well, kind of a reporter. I do those dumb little fluff pieces at the end of the news, you know. Like-um-monkey that can play the ukulele. I'm hoping to get some bigger stories soon.",Robin
"Bigger like, uh, gorilla with an up-right bass? Sorry, you're really pretty.  Oh, your friends don't seem too happy.",Ted
"Yeah, see the one in the middle just got dumped by her boyfriend so tonight every guy is... The enemy.",Robin
You know if you don't make your friend feel better you could throw a drink at my face. I don't mind.,Ted
She would love that! It does look fun in the movies.,Robin
"Hey, you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?",Ted
"Oh, I can't. I'm going to Orlando for a week on Friday. Some guys attempting to make a big  so my news is covering it.",Robin
That's going to take a week?,Ted
"Yeah, he's going to eat it too, it's another record.",Robin
"Uh, I know this is a long sh*t, but how about tomorrow night?",Ted
"Yeah,  What the hell  JERK!  that was fun.",Robin
De-wait for it-nied! Denied!,Barney
We're going out tomorrow night.,Ted
I thought we were playing laser tag tomorrow night?,Barney
"Yeah, I was never going to go play laser tag. ",Ted
"The next night, I took her out to this little bistro in Brooklyn.",Narrator
Wow that is one bad-ass blue French horn.,Robin
Yeah.,Ted
Mhmm.,Robin
Sort of looks like a... Smurf penis.,Ted
"Son, a piece of advice. When you go on a first date you really don't wanna say smurf penis. Girls don't ordinarily like that.",Narrator
But that was no ordinary girl.,Narrator
Lilly?,Marshall
How long have you been sitting there!? Stupid eye patch.,Lily
"Mom, dad, I have found the future Mrs. Ted Mosby! Marshall, how have I always described my perfect woman?",Ted

"Ray, when someone asks you if you're a god you say, Yes!",Robin
And I'm saving the best for last.,Ted
Do you want these?  I hate olives.,Robin
She hates olives! Awesome!,Marshall
The olive theory.,Lily
"The olive theory is based on my friends, Marshall and Lily. He hates olives, she loves them. In a weird way that's what makes them such a great couple. A Perfect balance .",Ted
"You know, I've had a jar of olives just sitting in my fridge forever.",Robin
I can take them off your hands.,Ted
they're all yours.,Robin
"Oh, it is on! It is on  till the break of dawn.",Marshall
"wait, it's only the break of ten-thirty. What happened?",Lily
"I've gotta get one of those blue French horns for over my fireplace. It's gotta be blue, it's gotta be French.",Robin
No Green Clarinet?,Ted
No.,Robin
"Come on, no purple tuba?",Ted
"It's a smurf penis, we're no dice.",Robin
"there you are! We've got a jumper! Some crazy guy on the Manhattan Bridge. Come on, you're covering it!",Producer
"Um, alright. I'll be right there.  I'm sorry. I had a really great time tonight.",Robin
Yeah.,Ted
So? Did you kiss her?,Marshall
"No. The moment wasn't right.  Look, this woman could be my future wife; I want our first kiss to be amazing.",Ted
"Aww, Ted that's so sweet. So you chickened out like the little bitch.",Lily
What? I did not chicken out! You know what? I don't need to take first kiss advice from some pirate who hasn't been single since the first week of college.,Ted
"Ted, anyone who's single would tell you the same thing. Even the dumbest single person alive, and if you don't believe me...call him.",Lily
"Hey loser, how's not playing laser tag? Because playing laser tag is awesome! Oh, I k*ll you Connor; don't make me get your mom!",Barney
"Hey, listen. I need your opinion on something.",Ted
"Okay, meet me at the bar in fifteen minutes-AND SUIT UP!",Barney
So these guys think I chickened out. What do you think?,Ted

She didn't even give me the signal.,Ted
"What is she goanna-is she goanna bat her eyes at you in Morse code ?? Ted  Kiss me-No, you just kiss her!",Barney
Not if you don't get the signal.,Ted
Ee- Did Marshall give me the signal?,Barney
"No!  I didn't, I swear.",Marshall
"But see-at least, tonight, I get to sleep knowing, Marshall and Me... never going to happen. You should've kissed her.",Barney
"Urgh, I should've kissed her. What about when she gets back from Orlando?",Ted
A week? That's like-a year in hot girl time. She'll forget all about you. Mark my words: you will never see that one again.,Barney
There she is...,Ted
"Ooo. She's cute!  Hey Carl, turn it up!",Lily
"...persuaded him to reconsider at which point the man came down off the ledge, giving this bizarre story a happy ending. Reporting from",Robin
"Huh, guy didn't jump",Marshall
"Metro One News, back to you bill.",Robin
I'm goanna go kiss her. Right now.,Ted
"Oh-Dude, it's midnight. As your future lawyer I'm goanna advise you: that's freakin' crazy!",Marshall
"I never do anything crazy! I'm always waiting for the moment! Planning the moment! Well she's leaving tomorrow this may be the only moment I'm goanna get! I gotta do what that guy couldn't, I gotta take the leap! Okay not a perfect metaphor, for me it's fall in love and get married-for him it's... death.",Ted
"Actually, that is a perfect metaphor. By the way, did I congratulate you two? ",Barney
I'm doing this. ,Ted
Let's go ,Lily

"Marshall, remember this night. When you're the best man at our wedding and you give a speech, you're goanna tell this story. ",Ted
Why does he get to be the best man?  I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND!,Barney
"As I walked up to that door a million thoughts raced through my mind. Unfortunately, one particular thought did not.",Narrator
I've got five dogs.,Robin
"Not good, not good, not good, not good.",Ted
No!,Lily
Go back in there!,Marshall
You're wearing a suit!,Barney
Ted?,Robin

Simple no would have sufficed.  She's lovely.,Barney
"So, Ted. What brings you back to Brooklyn at one in the morning in a-suit.",Robin
I was just hoping to get those olives... that you said I could have.,Ted
Would you like those olives with some Gin and Vermouth?,Robin
Are you trying to get me drunk?,Ted
For starters ,Robin
Thank you.,Ted
"So, Marshall. This Olive Theory based on you and Lily?",Barney
Yeah...,Marshall
"You hate olives? Lily loves them, you can't stand them.",Barney
"Yeah, hate olives.",Marshall
"Two weeks ago, Spanish bar on 79th Street, dish of olives-you had some. What up?",Barney
You have to swear that this does not leave this cab.,Marshall
I swear.,Barney
I swear.,Ranjit
"On our first date, I ordered a Greek salad; Lily asked if she could have my olives. I said, Sure... I hate olives.",Marshall
But you like olives!,Barney
"Well, I was eighteen, okay? I was a virgin. Been waiting for my whole life for a pretty girl to want my olives.",Marshall
"Marshall, I'm going to get you an early wedding present. Don't get married.",Barney
I think I like your Olive Theory.,Robin
I think I like your French Horn.,Ted
I think I like your nose.,Robin
I think I'm in love with you.,Ted
What?,Robin
"Come on man, you said your stomach's been hurting, right? You know what that is! Hunger. You're hungry for experience. Hungry for something new. Hungry for olives. But you're too scared to do anything about it.",Barney
"Yeah, I'm scared, okay? But when I think about spending the rest of my life with Lily... committing forever, no other women  doesn't scare me at all. I'm marrying that girl.  Lily. Lily, I like olives.",Marshall
We'll make it work. ,Lily
aww.,Ranjit
"So Orlando, you goanna hit Disney World?",Ted
You love me?,Robin
"Oh, god, I can't believe I said that. Why did I say that? Who says that? I should just go. ",Ted
Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Promised you these.,Robin
Olives. Thanks. I love you. What's wrong with me?,Ted
"Why are we still sitting here? Let's go! We can still make last call. What do you say Lil?  Yo, ho ho and a bottle o' rum?  'Cuz you're a pirate...",Barney
"Okay, eye patch gone- And we can't just abandon Ted. If it doesn't go well up there he's gonna need some support.",Lily
It's been like twenty minutes. You think they're doin' it?,Marshall
You think they're doing it in front of the dogs?,Barney
Doggie style. ,Marshall
I had this girl in college; she had a golden retriever-,Barney
"Okay, we can go to the bar, just stop talking.",Lily
Hit it Ranjit. ,Barney
"So when you tell this story to your friends, could you avoid the word psycho? I prefer...eccentric.",Ted
"Good night, psycho . ",Robin
Great  Umm... how do I get to the F Train?,Ted
"Oh, um-two blocks  that way  and take a right.",Robin
"Thanks.  You know what? . I'm done being single. I'm not good at it. Look, obviously you can't tell a woman you just met you love her. But... it sucks that you can't. I'll tell you something though, if a woman-not you... just some hypothetical woman-were to bare with me through all this. I think I'd make a damn good husband. Because that's the stuff I'd be good at. Stuff like making her laugh and being a good father... and walking her five hypothetical dogs. Being a good kisser.",Ted
Everyone thinks they're a good kisser.,Robin
"Oh, I've got references.",Ted
"Good night, Ted. ",Robin
And I'm a good hand shaker,Ted
that's a pretty great hand shake. ,Robin
"And that was it, probably never see her again.  What?",Ted
That was the signal!,Marshall
That long lingering handshake-you should've kissed her!,Lily
There's no such thing as the signal. But yeah-that was the signal.,Barney
Signal ,Rangit
"Ah, Carl thank you. Something I gotta do.",Marshal
"By the way, you should've kissed her.",Carl
Carl!?  You guys weren't there.,Ted
I am so turned on right now.,Lily
"Guys, trust me. I've seen the signal. That was not the signal.",Ted
"Yeah Ted, we're not on you anymore.",Barney
To my fianc√©!,Marshall
to the future!,Lily
To one hell of a night!,Ranjit
That was not the signal!,Ted
"I asked her about it years later, and yeah, that was the signal. I could've kissed her. But that's the funny thing about destiny.",Narrator
... it happens whether you plan it or not. I mean I...,Narrator
... never thought I'd see that girl again. But it...,Narrator
"...turns out, I was just too close...",Narrator
...to the puzzle to see the picture that was forming. Because that kids...,Narrator
"...is the true story, of how I met your Aunt Robin.",Narrator
Aunt Robin?,Son
I thought this was about how you met mom!,Daughter
Will you relax? I'm getting to it.  like I said:,Narrator
...it's a long story.,Narrator
"Okay, where was I?",Narrator
You were telling us how you met mom.,Daughter
In excruciating detail...,Son
"Right, so  back in 2005 when I was twenty-seven, my two best friends got engaged. And it got me thinking, Maybe I should get married. Then I saw... Robin. She was incredible. I just knew I had to meet her. That's where your Uncle Barney came in.",Narrator
"I suggest we play a little game I like to call, Have you Met Ted?",Barney
"No, no, no-we're not playing Have you Met Ted!",Ted
Hi! Have you met Ted? ,Barney
"So I asked her out, and I know this sounds crazy... but after just one date, I was in love with her, which made me say something stupid",Narrator
I think I'm in love with you.,Ted
What?,Robin
"Oh, Dad.",Daughter
So then what happened?,Son
"Nothing. I mean, I made a complete fool of myself. So... a week went by and I decided not to call her.",Narrator
"So you're not goanna call her? You went from, I think I'm in love with you to I'm not gonna call her?",Marshall
"I wasn't in love with her, okay? I was briefly in love with the abstract idea of getting married! That had absolutely nothing to do with Robin.  Robin!",Ted
Hey!,Robin
Look who I ran into!,Lily
Since when do you guys know each other?,Ted
"Uh... since about  here. Lily recognized me from the news and- Hello, Sailor!",Robin
They just got engaged.,Ted
"Well, I should get back to the station. See you guys.  Nice seeing you, Ted.",Robin
"Yeah, you too.  Damn it.",Ted
What?,Lily
I'm in love with her.,Ted
No! As your sponsor I will not let you relapse. You blew it; it's over-move on.,Barney
I don't know! I just have this feeling. She's the future Mrs. Ted Mosby.,Ted
"Lily, you squeaked?",Ted
"She said something about me didn't she? Come on, spill it, Red.",Ted
Fine!,Lily
So what do we think of Ted?,Lily
Ted's something else.,Robin
"Huh... I'm gonna spin that as good. Lots of guys are something, I'm something else.",Ted
Comes on a little strong.,Robin
But...that's part of my charm.,Ted
But that's part of his charm.,Lily
"Oh, totally. I mean, he's sweet, he's charming, he's just looking for something a little bit more serious than I am. I mean the most I can handle right now is something casual. This just stays between us, right?",Robin
Are you kidding? This flapper-for knocks.,Lily
Oops...,Lily
"She wants casual. Okay, I'll be casual. I'm gonna be a mushroom cloud of casual. You know why? Cause it's a game! I wanted to skip to the end and do the happily ever after thing but you don't get there unless you play the game.",Ted
So're you gonna ask her out?,Marshall
"Yeah-No! I can't ask her out, because if I ask her out I'm asking her out. So how do I ask her out, without asking her out? ",Ted
Did you guys get high?,Lily
I got it! I don't ask her out... I invite her to our party next Friday.,Ted
We're having a party next Friday?,Marshall
We are now-Casual,Ted
"Yeah, cuz nothing says Casual like inviting a hundred people over just to Mac on one girl. Oh, and Lily-that's my leg.",Barney
You waited five minutes to tell me that?,Lily
Alright-so call her up!,Marshall
No-calling's not casual! I just gotta bump into her somewhere. If only I knew her schedule I could arrange a chance encounter.,Ted
"that's great, Ted. You'll be the most Casual stalker ever.",Lily
"Now ever since Marshall put that ring on her finger, Lily had been...well... extra affectionate.",Narrator
"Baby, no. I have a twenty-five paged paper on unconstitutional law due on Monday, I barely started,",Marshall
"Hey, I'm just sitting here. Wearing my ring... my beautiful ring. Kind of makes wearing other stuff seem wrong. Like my shirt. Kind of don't wanna wear my shirt anymore. Or... my underwear. Oh-that's right-I'm not wearing any.",Lily
No underwear?,Marshall
Not slightly.,Lily
"Guys, boundaries! There she is!",Ted
"Thanks Bill, I'm reporting from the Razzle Dazzle Supermarket on 75th in Columbus",Robin

"Yeah, kid stuck in a crane machine, how sweet of you to call it news.",Robin
"Wow, kid in a crane machine  You just had to have that toy didn't ya? Couldn't play the game like everyone else.",Ted
You're all sweaty!,Leroy
"Cute kid  Um yeah it's f-it's so funny running into your we're having a party next Friday if-if you like swinging by! But, you know, whatever.",Ted
"Oh, I'm going back home next weekend. It's too bad it's not tonight.",Robin
"It is, it's tonight. This Friday, Did I say next Friday? Yeah-sorry-cuz I've been saying next Friday all week, but yeah it's tonight. The-uh-party's tonight. But, you know, whatever.",Ted
Hello?,Marshall
"hey, am I interrupting anything? ",Ted
"No, no I'm just writing my paper. Hitting the books.",Marshall
"Yeah, well you and Lily might wanna put some clothes on. We're throwing a party in two hours. Okay, bye ",Ted
"So, Gatsby, what are you goanna do when Robin shows up?",Marshall
"Okay, I got it all planned out.",Ted
"She steps through the door, and where's Ted? Not eagerly waiting by the door. Nah I'm across the room at my drafting table showing some foxy young thing all my cool architecture stuff. So Robin strolls over and I casually give her one of these, Hey, what's up? She says, Hey, nice place etcetera, etcetera. And then I say, Well make yourself at home, and I casually return to my conversation. Then, an hour later, Oh, you're still here? I say like I don't really care, but it's a nice surprise. And then very casually, Wanna see the roof?",Ted
Get her up to the roof and the roof takes care of the rest.,Ted
What's so special about the roof?,Barney
"Oh, the moon, the stars, the shimmering skyline. You can't not fall in love on that roof.",Lily
We do it up there sometimes.,Marshall
"Solid plan, my little friend.",Barney
We're the same height.,Ted
But may I suggest one little modification.,Barney
"That foxy young thing you were chatting up, take her up to the roof and have sex with her! Crazy monkey-style.",Barney
That's not the plan.,Ted
"Should be the plan, I mean look at her. Ted, look at her. She's smokin'!",Barney
"Yeah, but she's not Robin.",Ted
"Exactly! Ted, let's wrap. Statistic, at every New York party there's always a girl who has no idea whose party she's at. She knows no one you know, and you will never see her again. Do you see-where I'm going-hu-with this?",Barney
"Barney, I don't wanna say-",Ted
"Aargh!  Scoping, beep, scoping, beep!",Barney
Man you're a dork.,Lily
"beep, beep, beep, beep. Target acquired! And now it's time we play a little game I like to call Have You Met Ted?",Barney

I don't think so.,Ted
"Your loss, her gain.  Excuse me, can I show you the roof? It's magical up there!",Barney
Sure ,Tatiana
Whoa-whoa-Hey hey. I got that roof reserved!,Ted
"Dude, Robin's not coming.",Barney
"Hey, she's goanna show up.  She'll show up.",Ted
She didn't show up.,Narrator
At least it was a great party.,Lily
I ate like four whole cans of dip!,Marshall
You always know what to say old friend.,Ted
It's Robin.,Ted
Answer it!,Lily
"No, no, no. Not right away. I gotta seem casual.  Hello?",Ted
I'm so sorry I missed your party.,Robin
Who is this? Merideth?,Ted

"Oh, Robin! Hey, yeah, guess you never showed up did you?",Ted
"no I got stuck at work, but they finally got that kid out of the crane machine.",Robin
Did he get to keep the purple giraffe?,Ted
"Yeah, they let him keep all the toys. He was in there a long time and little kids have smaller bladders.",Robin
nan,Ted
I wish your party was tonight.,Robin
"It is the party's tonight.  Yeah-uh-it's a two day party. Because that's just how we roll. Uh-so if you wanna swing by its-uh-you know, Casual. See ya.  So that was Robin.",Ted
"What are you doing to me, man. I got a paper to write.",Marshall
I know I'm sorry. It's terrible  I'll buy more dip ,Ted
"TED! TED WAIT-GET FRENCH ONION.  Can you believe this guy, I got a paper to write.  Okay, fine- but it's gotta be like super quick.",Marshall
Oh!,Lily
And no cuddling after.,Marshall
I'm the luckiest girl alive ,Lily
"Oh, you were so right about the roof. The roof. The roof is on fire, Ted! Girl from last night, took her back to my place then this morning took her outside, spun her around a couple of times sent her walking-she will never find her way back and there she is. How did she get here? Did you invite her?",Barney
I have no idea who that is.,Ted
"She said she works with Carlos, who's Carlos?",Barney
I don't know any Carlos.,Ted
"Grr.  Hi, you. You're back.",Barney
"I sure am . Come on, sweetie, I need a drink.",Tatiana
sweetie? Really?  Sweetie?,Barney
"Whoa-Whoa rabbits! Come on, I got that roof reserved.",Ted
Alright.,Marshall
"So, it's over between me-and-works with Carlos girl.",Barney
"Oh, that was fast.",Ted
"Yeah, I was trying to think what's the quickest way to get rid of a girl you just met?",Barney
I think I'm in love with you.,Barney
What?,Tatiana
"Thanks, bro ",Barney
Glad I could help.,Ted
"What the-no, no, no, no-come on!",Ted
"Sorry, Ted. ",Marshall

"No, no.",Crowd
"Hello, Barney.",Tatiana
Of course.,Barney
You look well. Isn't it weird they invited both of us?,Tatiana
Who? Who invited you? No one even know who you are!,Barney
"I understand you're hurt, but, you don't have to be cruel. Carlos was right about you.",Tatiana
Who is Carlos!?,Barney
"Okay, where the hell is my-OHH!  Okay, introduction to contract work institution statutes from 1865 to 1923...is not a coaster! Ted! I'm jeopardizing my law career so that you can throw not one, not two, but three parties for some girl that you just met who's probably not gonna show up.  I mean where is she, Ted, huh? Where's Robin?  Hi! Hi Robin. ",Marshall
so you threw all these parties for me?,Robin
"No! Oh you thought that-oh, no! I c-okay yes. You got me-I--one of the reasons I threw these parties was so that I could introduce you to uh- this guy. I figured, you know, since it didn't work out between us and now we can just laugh about it -Anyway Robin, this is.",Ted
Carlos ,Carlos
"She's still talking to Carlos. I can still win this, it's not over.",Ted
"Okay, buddy, time for the tough-talk. Robin seems great. But let's look at the facts, you wanna get married and right now there's a million women in New York looking for exactly you, but Robin ain't one of them.",Lily
She's not just one of them she's the one.,Ted
"Yeah well, the one is heading up to the roof. ",Barney
What are you gonna do?,Marshall
"Nothing. It's a game, I gotta just-keep playing it.",Ted
Hey.,Robin
"Hey. Carlos, can you give us a minute?",Ted
"Hey, no sweat hombre.",Carlos
"Robin, look I didn't invite you to this party to set you up with Carlos. Or the one before that. Or the one before that.  I threw these parties because I wanted to see you.",Ted
"Well, here I am.",Robin
"There's something here, look, unless I'm crazy.",Ted
"you're not crazy. I-I don't know, Ted, I mean we barely know each other and you're looking at me with that look and it's like-",Robin
Like what?,Ted
"like-let's fall in love, and get married and have kids and drive them to soccer practice.",Robin
I'm not gonna force sports on them unless they're interested.,Ted
It's a great look. But you're looking at the wrong girl.,Robin
"No, I'm not.",Ted
"Yes, you are. I don't wanna get married right now, maybe ever and if we got together I'd feel like I'd either have to marry you or break your heart and-I just couldn't do either of those things. Just like you can't turn off the way you feel.",Robin
Click. Off. Let's make out.,Ted
What?,Robin
"What? That was the off switch! And I turned it off. I mean sure yes, I wanna fall in love get married blah, blah, blah, but-on the other hand... you... me...the roof.",Ted
There's no off switch.,Robin
There is an off switch... and it's off.,Ted
"no, it's not.",Robin

So ,Ted

Oh ,Ted
"look, I know it sounds insincere when people say that but... we could.",Robin
"I don't know, Robin. I made such a jackass out of myself here, every time we start hanging out it'll be like, Oh-that's right-I'm a jackass.",Ted
You're not a jackass. I'm sorry. I only moved here in April and I'm always working and-I just haven't met a lot of good people so far. But I understand.,Robin
"Well-uh-maybe in a few months after it's not so fresh, we could all-uh...you know, get a beer.",Ted
"yeah.  That sounds good. I'll see you, Ted. ",Robin
"Or, you know-now.  We could all get a beer now.",Ted
I'd like that.,Robin
"My friends are goanna love you-like you-you know, as a friend.  Jackass.",Ted

At least let me buy you a beer. Come on I'll buy everyone a beer.,Ted
"I'll help carry. You know something, Ted?",Robin
What?,Ted
"You are a catch. You're gonna make some girl very happy, and I am going to help you find her.",Robin
"Well, good luck. I mean maybe New York's just too big a town, you know? There's millions of people in this city. How in all this mess is a guy supposed to find the love of his life? I mean, where do you even begin?",Ted
"Hi, Have you met Ted?",Robin
"Hi, I'm Ted ",Ted

You guys talking to each other? Nobody's listening.,Marshall
What's wrong with MacLaren's?,Ted
"MacLaren's is bore, snore. Ted, tonight we're going to go out. We're going to meet some ladies. It's going to be legendary. Phone-five! ",Barney

"You didn't phone-five did you? I know when you don't phone-five, Ted. Come on, we always go to MacLaren's.",Barney
"Yeah, cause MacLaren's is fun...",Ted
MacLaren's is this much fun. What I'm offering is the chance to have this much fun.,Barney
"See, you say that. You say it's going to be this much fun. But most of the time it ends up being this much fun. This much fun is good! It's safe. It's guaranteed!",Ted
"This hand gesture thing doesn't really work on the phone, does it?",Barney
No it doesn't.,Ted
Get in the cab. Marshall you too.,Barney
"Oh, I wish I could... I think Lily and I are just goi...",Marshall
I understand.  Get in the cab.,Barney
Why can Marshall say no?,Ted
Uhh... because he's getting laid.,Barney

"It's not a rut, okay. It's a routine and I like it!",Ted

"Okay, I'm outta here.",Ted
"Estaban, doors! ",Barney
Just this one little thing and the rest of the night is ours.,Barney
"Why do you have those suitcases, and who are we picking up?",Ted

Wait so when you said you were going to pick someone up at the airport. You meant you were going to pick someone up at the airport.,Ted
"Scenario. Couple of girls fly into town, looking for a fun weekend in NYC when they meet two handsome international business men just back from a lucrative trip to Japan. Sample dialogue, You have a wheelie bag? Wh... I have a wheelie bag!",Barney
You've gotta be kidding me.,Ted
"False. Sidebar, tuck in your shirt. You look sketchy.",Barney
I'm sketchy?,Ted
"Trust me, it's going to be legendary.",Barney
"Don't say legendary, okay? You're too liberal with the word legendary.",Ted
We're building an igloo in Central Park. It's gonna be legendary. Snow suit up!,Barney
"Ted, Ted, Ted. Right here! This is happening. Now you can either put your bags on the carousel now, or you can listen to me give you a really long speech convincing you to put the bags on the carousel. Your move.  Ted, since the dawn of time mankind has struggled... ",Barney
"That night, Marshall had a ton of studying to do. So Lily went out with Robin who was new to New York and looking for a friend.",Narrator
I'm so glad we finally get to hang out just the two of us!,Lily
Yeah.,Robin
You sure you're okay giving up your Friday night to hang with an old almost-married lady?,Lily

"Unless it's the end of the night, then you get on anything.",Lily
Heyow!,Robin
Compliments of that guy.,Carl
Really? Sweet.,Lily
"Oh, for you it's six dollars.",Carl

"Oh. Oh, hello!",Lily
"So...uh, did you just get in from Detroit?  Japan. ",Ted
"Okay, carousel four is tapped out. Ready? Because I'm about to drop some knowledge. Cute girls are not from Buffalo. Time-out. Ten o'clock. You ready to rock this, Tedder?",Barney

You are? Well...uh...guess we'll see you on the plane.,Laura
"Yes, you will.  Follow them, tickets on me.",Barney
"No, Barney. Don't you get on that escalator! And don't you dare get on that subsequent escalator!",Ted

"Whoa, whoa, whoa, the seatbelt light is on.",Ted
"Ted, you've been living your whole life in a seatbelt. It's time to unclick. ",Barney
"Yeah, sorry, sorry.",Barney
So I grew up in Park Slope.,Lily
"Oh, I love Park Slope. When did you move to Manhattan?",Robin
"Uh, no she is. ",Robin
"Yeah, I'm a ghost! Died fifteen years ago, like that pickup line.",Robin

Isn't that great.,Laura
So great.,Ted
"So there we were, stuck on a plane to Philadelphia with two very unsingle girls. All thanks to your Uncle Barney.",Narrator
Aren't they cute? They're both linebackers for the Eagles.,Laura
Both?  Both of their boyfriends are linebackers.,Ted
You're going to Philly? Why...,Lily
I...I didn't ask.,Marshall
Well it sounds like you're having a lot more fun than I am. I'm just talking to guys' backs while they hit on Robin.,Lily
"Ouff, yeah... I bet she gets that a lot.",Marshall
Don't you bet I get that a lot?,Lily
"Not with a ring on your finger. I mean, you know, guys see the ring and it's like Cha-Chung! Marshall parking only.",Marshall
"Oh, of course, that's it the ring! I guess I'm not used to it yet.",Lily
"Oh, it's totally the ring. If you took that ring off your finger, you'd have a ton o' guys crowding around your junk.",Marshall
I'm not going to take off my ring! Wouldn't you be jealous of guys swarming all over my beeswax?,Lily
"Oh yeah, you know me, I'm the jealous type. Any groom so much as look at you, I'm a sack him in the kisser, no seriously, you girls have a good time tonight. ",Mashall

"You demand!? No, no, no, no, no... he does not demand. We... we... we have no demands!",Ted
"Okay, yeah. I'm calm... I'm totally calm.",Ted
Those bags were your responsibility.,Barney
They were your bags.,Ted
"Look, this is all just... it's a misunderstanding.",Ted
Please.  We are international businessmen. My colleague accidentally left the bags there now please let us go before we miss our international business meeting.,Barney
"Believe it or not, that duff bag thing worked.",Barney
"Truth is, my friend... he does this thing where he goes to airports with fake luggage to pick up girls and we followed some here to Philadelphia. That's it! That's all this is!",Ted
"Yes, he's that lame. Tell them you're that lame!",Ted
We are international businessmen...,Barney
OH COME ON!,Ted
"Dude, seriously, relax.",Barney
We at least get to call our lawyer.,Ted
Exactly!  We have a lawyer?,Barney
"Listen to me, you're both American citizens. Don't let them pull any patriot-act voodoo. You both retain the right to refuse to answer any questions without an attorney present so don't say anything until I get there, alright? Okay, goodbye  To Philly! The adventure continues! Destroy!",Marshall
"It's ridiculous in here, why don't we go somewhere else?",Robin
"No, this place is great ",Lily
What are you doing?,Robin

With your lips and everything...?,Robin
My lips are always like this ,Lily
You had to play the race card.,Ted
"Relax, Ted. We didn't do anything wrong. And, B.T.W, we'd be out of here by now if you'd have tucked in your shirt. ",Barney
Don't come to Philly.,Ted

Only all the time.,Dana
"Ever, like, stick your head inside it?",Barney
Yeah.,Dana

"Lily, I thought tonight was about us hanging out, what are you doing?",Robin
Just fending up the advances of that totally hot guy.,Lily
"Dude, I think that guy is gay.",Robin
"Oh, I know that guy is gay. Just Marshall and I have been together for nine years. I haven't been single since high school.",Lily
"You wanna be single?  You wanna fight off loser guys all night, does that seem like fun to you?",Robin
"I guess I wanted to throw this net back into the ocean and see how many fish I could catch. So far, one. One gay dolphin. ",Lily
"And Marshall. Lily, all these girls here tonight are looking to catch what you've already got.",Robin
You're right I know. Hey do you wanna get some coffee and have an actual conversation?,Lily
"If, by Coffee you mean Cheesecake, then yes.",Robin
"Hey, I got that Club Soda. Let's see that booty. ",Derrick
"Oh, thank you so much.",Lily
"Marshall, no.",Lily
"Baby, please don't ever take that ring off again. No matter how awesome I say that it is.",Marshall
"It's okay, man...",Derrick
BACK OFF HOMBRE. I'm not that afraid to fight you. You wanna test this guy? Be my guest!,Marshall
"Marshall, he's gay!",Lily
"Oh, thank god... I've never been in a fight before. ",Marshall
You don't say!,Derrick
"So it turns out Uncle Marshall really was the jealous type. Unfortunately, that guys boyfriend... also the jealous type.",Narrator
Hey!,Lily
Could have licked the Liberty Bell.,Barney
We're going to the airport.,Ted
"Bong, bong...",Barney
"Why do I hang out with you? Why? All I wanted was to have a regular beer, in a regular bar with my regular friends, in my regular city!",Ted
"Ted, Ted... you're not even looking.",Barney
"No, I'm not.",Ted
"Look, our forefathers died for the pursuit of happiness, okay. Not for the sit around and wait of happiness. Now if you want, you can go to the same bar, drink the same beer talk to the same people everyday, or you can lick the Liberty Bell! You can grab life by the crack and lick the crap out of it!",Barney
"Thanks, Leonard. Ted, you're missing out on a valuable life lesson!",Barney
"Look, I don't need you to teach me how to live, okay. I know how to live. If you want to go lick the Liberty Bell just go lick it yourself.",Ted
"No, it has to be the two of us.",Barney
Why? Why do you need me?,Ted
"Because, you're my best friend, alright? You don't have to tell me I'm yours. But the way I see it, we're a team. Without you, I'm just the dynamic uno. You know what, fine. If you wanna go home... then we'll go home.",Barney
Fine...we'll go lick the Liberty Bell!,Ted
"Good,  'cuz we're here! ",Barney
"I had no idea how Barney redirected the cab without me knowing, but we got out, Dana let us in and by god we licked the Liberty Bell. And you know what it tastes like?",Ted
Freedom... No actually it tasted like pennies.,Ted
"We really did and that was when I realized why I hung out with Barney. I never got where I thought I wanted to go, but I always got a great story.",Narrator
"So, that girl you were talking to... that was mom?",Daughter
"Kids, every story in a man's life is like a dot in an impressionist's painting. And when you...",Narrator
So that's a no?,Son
"Yeah, that's a no.  What? Come on!",Narrator
"Kids, when you're single all you're looking for is happily ever after. But only one of your stories can end that way. The rest end with someone getting hurt. This is one of those stories, and it starts... with a shirt.",Narrator
A shirt?,Daughter
Just listen...,Narrator
Because none of this would have happened if it hadn't have been for that shirt.,Narrator
Wow.,Ted
Nice shirt!,Robin
Right? Right?,Ted
Look at those colors! Green and brown together at last!,Lily
"Hot top, Bro, is it new?",Marshall
"That's the crazy part. I've had this shirt for, like, six years... Until this morning I wasn't into it at all, but now it's like my tastes have changed.",Ted
Booger.,Barney
"Yes, hello, Barney.",Ted
Barney's offering me fifty bucks to say some stupid word on a live news report.,Robin
"Not some stupid word, Booger.",Barney
"But I'm not doing it, I am a journalist.",Robin
"What? Journalist? You do the little fluff pieces at the end of the news. Old people, babies, monkeys... that's not journalism, that's just things in a diaper.",Barney
"For your information, my boss is about to bump me up to the City Hall b*at.",Robin
"City hall, Miss Thang!",Lily
So I'm not going to jeopardize my promotion by saying Booger for fifty bucks.,Robin
"Of course not, because now you're saying Nipple and it's a hundred!  Step into my web.",Barney
Mmm... Who's bourbon is this?,Ted
"Ooh, I don't know. It was here when we sat down.",Lily
"Aaah, point is. I seem to like bourbon now. I could have sworn I hated bourbon. First the shirt, now bourbon. I spent twenty-seven years making up my mind about things, right? The movie I saw once in Haden, the city I'll never go back to because it was raining the day I visited. Maybe it's time to start forming some second impressions...",Ted
"You're finally gonna watch Goonies AGAIN? Slow love, Chuck.",Marshall
"Not Goonies, girls. What if there's someone from my past, who I thought was wrong for me at the time, but in fact she, like my shirt, is actually a perfect fit?",Ted
"Hold up, there are only two reasons to date a girl you've already dated. Breast, Implants.",Barney
"That's not a bad idea. Let's think, Ted's greatest hits... what about that girl, Steph?",Lily
Steph...,Ted
"Okay, this is difficult to say, back when I lived in LA, I was pretty broke, so I spent a month making adult films.",Stefanie
"Wow, okay... how many did you make?",Ted
A-hundred-and-seventy-five.,Stefanie
Say what you will about the p*rn industry... they are hard workers.,Lily
What about that chick...um...Jackie?,Marshall
And my bathing suit had fallen completely off.,Ted
"I know the feeling, once... when I was sixteen, I was driving, and I hit this hitchhiker. Don't know what happened to him... just kept drivin'! ",Jackie
Uh...no.,Ted
What about Natalie!,Lily
Who's Natalie?,Robin
"Natalie, I had so many fond memories of her. The tea candles on her dresser. The sock monkey collection on her bed. That one Belle and Sebastian song that she always listened to. Her smile.",Narrator
"Man, I haven't seen her in like three years!",Ted
Well why'd you guys break up?,Robin
"I just wasn't looking for a big commitment at the time, of course now a big commitment doesn't seem so bad... maybe I should call her? What do you guys think?",Ted
You dumped a p*rn star? Friendship over  FRIENDSHIP OVER!,Barney
"You wanted to see me, Mr. Adams?",Robin
"City Hall?  Oh, my god.",Robin
"So, next time you're passing City Hall, make sure and stop by New York's oldest hotdog cart. Today a delicious hotdog will cost you $2.50, but back when the stand first opened in 1955, you could get one for only a nipple. Reporting live, Robin Scherbatsky, Metro News One.",Robin
"I said, Nipple on the news! That was so unprofessional! I said, Nipple on the news!",Robin
At least it's better than booger.  Booger.,Lily
"There she is. Hey is it cold in here, because I can kind of see Robin's nickels? Now for your next challenge...",Barney
"No, there is not going to be another challenge, I don't care how much you offer me.",Robin
"Oh, search your soul, Robin. You and I both know this wasn't about the money. Sure, Metro News One pays you jack and hey, a little green salad on the side's good for you, me and Mr. McGee.",Barney
"Seriously, who talks like that?",Lily
"Well baby really likes, is the thrill of pulling one over on those bean counters, who under appreciate you and still haven't promoted you. And for two more hundy-sticks, baby's going to look in the camera and say this ",Barney
Eew. I'm just assuming.,Lily
I gotta get back to work. See ya.,Robin
Bye.,Lily
Baby's going to think about it.,Robin
Found it! I found Natalie's number.,Ted
"Hey, Ted. Nice shirt! Is it yesterday already?",Lily
"Thank you. I am calling her; this is crazy I haven't talked to her in, like, three years. I wonder if she even remembers me.",Ted
Hello?,Natalie
"Natalie, its Ted Mosby.",Ted
Go to hell. ,Natalie
She remembers me.,Ted
Why would Natalie hang up on you?,Lily
I don't know!,Ted
Did you sleep with her sister?,Barney
No.,Ted
Sleep with her mom?,Barney
No.,Ted
I'm losing interest in your story.,Barney
"Well, you must have done something. Why did you guys break up?",Lily
He wasn't ready for a commitment.,Marshall
Uh-huh.,Lily
And her birthday might have been coming up.,Ted
Uh-huh...,Lily
"Okay, so I didn't wanna get a boyfriend level gift for a girl I was just about to break up with.",Ted
So you dumped her right before her birthday?,Lily
"No, I didn't dump her... right before her birthday.",Ted
Uh-oh.,Marshall
"Natalie! Hey, Happy Birthday! Listen...",Ted
Never...break...up...with...a...girl...on...her...birthday!,Lily
"LILY WAIT, THE SHIRT! I KNOW, IT WAS A MISTAKE!",Ted
"Well, did she cry her eyes out?",Lily
I don't know.,Ted
"How do you n...Oh, you didn't!",Lily
"Natalie! Hey, Happy Birthday!  Listen... you're awesome. You really are... awesome. I'm just like super busy right now, so... maybe we should just... call it a day. But you're awesome.",Ted
On...her...answering...machine!? And...on...her... birthday? Oh... who... breaks... up... with... somebody... on... their... answering... machine... on... their... birthday?!,Lily
"Yeah, dude, email!",Marshall
"Not exactly the point I was trying to make, Marshall. That is a terrible way to break up with someone.",Lily
"Okay, in my client's defense. Is there an unterrible way to break up with somebody? No. Personally I'd rather hear the bad news on an answering machine than face the humiliation in person.  It's the least painful way you can do it. Who are you calling?",Marshall
"Hi, Marshall, it's Lily. We're not going have sex for at least a month. But you're awesome. Okay bye-bye. ",Lily
"Know, that was a big mistake, Ted. You should've done it in person.",Barney
Thank you.,Lily
Desperate Please-don't-leave-me sex is amazing.,Barney
"Okay, it was childish and stupid, I just...I didn't want to see her cry.",Ted
Well guess what? She cried! You just didn't have the sack to face those tears.,Lily
"That was me then, okay? This is the new old shirt-wearing, sack-having Ted. I'm gonna make this right.",Ted
You know what else? My younger sister just got married and I'm about to turn thirty-sex. Fantastic.,Barney
"An occasion that was supposed to be joyous suddenly turned tragic when Ethel and Sadie Marsolis, New York's oldest twins, suddenly passed away on this, the eve of their one hundredth birthday. I'm a dirty, dirty girl . Ow. Reporting live, Robin Scherbatsky, Metro News One.",Robin
Joel Adam's wants to see you in his office ,Producer
"Before you say anything, I just want to say, I really like working here at Metro News One.",Robin
What?,Robin
Take him to the vet?,Robin
Was that all?,Robin
And nothing about the twins' story?,Robin
"That's when Robin realized, no one, not even her boss, watched Metro News One.",Narrator
Hi.,Ted
"Natalie. Come on, I just want to say I'm sorry. I only came down here because you wouldn't take my call.",Ted
I have an idea. Why don't you leave a message?,Natalie
"Good one. Okay, fine. I'm just going to leave this sock monkey here  Goodbye.",Ted
Natalie... I.,Ted
OH!,Natalie
"OKAY, okay... I... look, look. I know you're mad. Happy Birthday  Three years ago.",Ted
Oh yeah? Up yours... three years ago ,Natalie
"No, look... I was an idiot for leaving that message. I realize how much that sucked.",Ted
No you don't.,Natalie
"Maybe we should just, call it a day? But you're awesome. Okay, bye. ",Ted
"There was a surprise party that night?  How come nobody told me? People think I can't keep a secret but I totally can! Sorry, not the issue... Look, Natalie, I was just a stupid kid back then, terrified of commitment.",Ted
And I suppose you're suddenly ready to get married and settle down?,Natalie
"Well, yeah, actually . I'm a different guy now. Give me another chance.",Ted
You must think I have absolutely no self respect.,Natalie
Come on... Just a cup of coffee.  Please Natalie. Give the guy a chance.  Self respect is over-rated! ,Ted
"Wow. Maybe it was the caffeine, but you really brought your game up to a whole new level.",Natalie
"Thanks. I did just start subscribing to esquire. They have some helpful columns. The following, is from the October issue.",Ted
"So, Natalie and I started dating again and just like that it all came back. The tea candles. The Sock monkeys. Belle and Sebastian... all of it. It seemed like happily ever after wasn't far off.",Narrator
"Well I better run, I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour.",Natalie
"Krav Maga, how cool is it that she does Krav Maga?",Ted
Thanks honey.,Natalie
Hmm...,Ted
"Bye, guys.",Natalie
Bye.,All
"Dude, what's Krav Maga?",Marshall
I have no idea. Some kind of yoga?,Ted
"You know, that Natalie... she's good times.",Barney
"Yeah, she's like the best girl you've dated in years.",Marshall
"Yeah, Ted, hold on to that one.",Lily
"Yeah, I have to break up with her.",Ted
"I don't get it, man, Natalie is awesome.",Marshall
"I know, she's terrific, but I have to break up with her.",Ted
Why... couldn't... you... leave... that... poor... girl... alone?,Lily
"I know! I hate this. These past three weeks have been great. I should be in love with her, but I'm not feeling that thing. It's ineffable.",Ted
Ineffable... good word. So when are you going to do it?,Marshall
"She's probably on the subway by now. You could call her Voice Mail. Beep, dumped. Click. Done!",Barney
I have to do this face-to-face. I just... I don't know what I'm going to say!,Ted
I'm not ready for a commitment.,Marshall
"Oh, that's such a clich√©.",Lily
"It's not a clich√©, it's a classic. It's the stairway to heaven of breakup lines.",Marshall
"Well, I think Natalie deserves better.",Lily
Better. There's no better in breaking up. There's only less awful. A clich√©'s a clich√© for a reason. It's comforting.,Marshall
"It doesn't matter, I already told her I am ready for a commitment, so... oh, my god... there's no way out... I'm going to have to marry her.",Ted
"No, no. We're going to get you out of this. Okay, how about... It's not you it's me?",Marshall
"Mm... Mm! Six words! You... look... fat... in... those... jeans..., you're free to go.",Barney
"Ted, have you considered telling her the truth?",Lily
"Seriously, honey, men are working, here.",Barney
"Ted, what is the truth? Why do you want to break up with her?",Lily
The truth? She's not the one.,Ted
"So, tell her that.",Lily
"Oh, you can't tell her that. That's horrible.",Marshall
Why? What is so horrible about that?,Lily
"Yeah, what is so horrible about that?...She's not the one. Why is that such a heart-breaking thing to hear? The chances of one person being another person's The one are like six billion to one.",Ted
"Yeah, you have better chances of winning the lottery.",Lily
"Exactly, you wouldn't take it personally if you lost the lottery.",Ted
"Alright, man, tell her the truth. She's goanna cry.",Marshall
"Yeah, and he's going to sit there and he's going to take it like a man.",Lily
I have to do the mature thing.,Ted
Want to talk mature? I just wrapped up a live newscast by honking my own boobs.,Robin
"And great TV was had by all. Alright Scherbatsky, new challenge. And this one's big. But so, is the cash reward. For one thousand dollars, you heard me, all you have to do is get up there on the news and do one of these... ",Barney
What the hell is that?,Robin
The Ickey Shuffle.,All
"And as you do it, you say this, Elbert Ickey Woods. The bangles were fools to cut you in '91. Your 1521 rushing yards and your 27 touch downs will not be forgotten. So Coach Dave Shullah, screw you and your crappy steakhouse.",Barney
"Just write it down for me. What do I care, it's not like anyone's watching anyway, right? ",Robin
"Man, she's gonna cry.",Ted
Slow loves junk,Lily
"Thanks, Lil.",Ted
So the next night I took Natalie out to dinner. To do the mature thing.,Narrator
"Look, uh, Natalie there's something I have to say.",Ted
"Oh wait, wait. There's something I have to say first. Today at work, I had not one, not two, but three birthday cakes, so tonight; can we just skip the cake?",Natalie
Today is your birthday?,Ted
"Yeah, no that's okay... I wasn't telling anyone about it.",Natalie
Today's your birthday! I... I didn't get you anything.,Ted
"Oh, it's okay. You know you've already given me the best present of all. I can trust again.",Natalie
"You're welcome.  Oh, so much more wine.",Ted
"Henry, as New York's oldest handsome cab driver, you've seen quite a lot.",Robin
In your past sixteen years on the job what is your most exciting memory?,Robin
Well...,Henry
Ahh! This is it.,Barney
"Oh, boy, here we go.",Lily
"Everyone, everyone... If I may direct your attention to the television. You're about to see something... amazing.",Barney
"And them, in '72, Mickey Mantle rode my cab for the fourth time.",Henry
"Come on, baby... bring it home.",Barney
"But the most exciting moment, that would have to be this one, right now.",Henry
What?,Robin
"Look at me, I'm on TV. I never thought I'd have my story told. Thank you, Miss Robin Scherbatsky.",Henry
Thank you.,Henry
"And right then, Aunt Robin realized how important her job truly was.",Narrator
"It's an honor to tell your story, Henry.",Robin
"You know, Metro News One may not be number one in viewer ship. But this reporter takes pride in...  Whoa!! OH! Oh, my god! I'm covered in horse crap! It's in my hair!! Oh my, ow... ow my knee.",Robin
You planned that?,Marshall
"No, Marshall. That was beyond my wildest dreams ",Barney
"So, if you ever come to Alabama, my mom throws these huge crawfish boils and she's just dying to meet you, by the way.",Natalie
"Look, Natalie, there's something I have to say and there's no good way to say it. I wanna break up. I don't think you're the one for me. I don't want to waste your time because I really like you. I wanna do right by you, and I think the best way to do that is just to be honest. I'm sorry.  Just let it out. They're only tears.  Aah!",Ted
I'm not the one for you?,Natalie
I'm sorry. I just thought the mature thing to do would be...,Ted
It's my birthday!,Natalie
"Yes, I know I didn't realize that it was...",Ted
It's my birthday and you're telling me I'm not the one for you?,Natalie
It's really not such a big deal. I mean it's the odds. It's like you lost the lottery.,Ted
"Oh, so dating you is like winning the lottery?",Natalie
"No, no, no. I didn't mean that.",Ted
"Okay, So what's the problem?",Natalie
It's... I can't explain it.,Ted
TRY!,Natalie
It's... ineffable.,Ted
I'm not F-able?,Natalie
"No, no, no, no. Ineffable, ineffable means it can't be explained.",Ted
"Oh, so I'm stupid?",Natalie
"Oh, god what's going on?",Ted
"Okay, what's going on is, you broke my heart over my answering machine... on my birthday, waited three years for me to get over you. Tracked me down, begged me to go out with you again only so you could dump me three weeks later. Again on my birthday!",Natalie
"No, it's... it's not like that. I'm just... it's, it's, it's.",Ted
WHAAAT!?,Natalie
I'm just like super busy right now.,Ted
Remember when Natalie said.,Narrator
I have my Krav Maga class in half an hour.,Natalie
Turns out Krav Maga is not a kind of yoga. It's a form of gorilla street fighting developed by the Israeli army.,Narrator
This is compliments of those two gentlemen at the bar. ,Waiter
But isn't it nice to know that people are watching?,Barney
"Oh, my god. Are you alright?",Marshall
What happened to you?,Lily
"Told the truth, turns out the truth has a mean round house kick.",Ted
"Oh, man.",Marshall
"Oh, well you did the right thing. I'm proud of you.",Lily
I'm bleeding internally.,Ted
"Hey, Ted, you know what always picks me up when I'm down? Other people's misfortune. You missed something so amazing.",Barney
Please can we please have one person in this whole bar who didn't see it?,Robin
Fine.,Barney
Are you okay?,Lily
"I really thought I was going the good way this time. I guess there is no good way. Sometimes no matter how hard you try to do the right thing, you just end up flat on your back flailing around in a big pile of horse crap!",Ted
You saw it?,Robin
"It's going against the internet now! It's okay, grow up.",Ted
And that's how it ended with Natalie. No happily ever after. Just a whole lot of hurt. And just like that all those wonderful memories were replaced. By this one,Narrator
"But you know, bad as that night was... within a year Natalie was married. With three beautiful children. So that's the up side of her. Sometimes it happens for a reason.",Narrator
"Wow, so you b*at up by a girl?",Son
Is that all you're taking away from this story?,Narrator
You got b*at up by a girl?,Son
"Hey, she knew Krav Maga.",Narrator
"So kids, would you like to hear the story of the time I went deaf?",Narrator
Why does he even ask?,Son
"I know, he's just going to tell us anyway.",Daughter
I sure am. It all began.,Narrator
When Robin strolled into the bar and said.,Narrator
Say you're my bitch.,Robin
I'm your bitch. Why this time?,Ted
"Because tonight, I am getting us all into Okay.",Robin
Okay!? Awesome!!,Barney
"What's going on, did I just have a stroke?",Ted
"Okay is the name of a club. Yeah, it's supposed to be incredibly exclusive. This friend of mine once waited outside for two hours, he couldn't get in.",Barney
A friend of yours named you?,Ted
"No... a friend of mine named, shut up.",Barney
"Yeah, well the owner goes to my gym. It turns out that he is a fan of my reporting for Metro News One. So now, I'm on the list for tonight.",Robin
"Nice going, Scherbatsky. You're becoming a long and difficult-to-spell household name.",Ted
He's even getting me into the VIP room.,Robin
"Yeah, he just wants to show you his own VIP if you know what I mean...",Barney
"Okay, what does VIP stand for in your universe?",Robin
... I know that the P is penis.,Barney
"Alright, so you guys are in. Should I invite Marshall and Lily?",Robin
Why was this funny? I'll explain. You see.,Narrator
"Lily was a kindergarten teacher. And so, one fateful naptime...",Narrator
Austin and I spent Saturday night at the most charming bed and breakfast. It was so nice. What did you do this weekend?,Claire
"CHUG, CHUG, CHUG ",Crowd
TEN SECONDS!!,Marshall
SUCK IT LOSERS! ,Lily
"You know, quiet time with the fianc√©.",Lily
"I don't know, I just felt embarrassed. Claire is my age, and she and her husband do all these classy grownup stuff. Maybe we should start doing some grownup stuff.",Lily
That was some pretty grownup stuff we did this morning.,Marshall
"Yeah, but it wasn't classy. Maybe we should have a wine tasting party.",Lily
"I like wine. I like tasting. You know I can party, let's do it. Let's rock it, maturity style!",Marshall
"Ever since then she's been signing him up for book clubs, cooking classes...",Ted
All the things you do when you know where the next ten thousand lays are coming from.,Barney
"So, no. Lily and Marshall will not be doing this.",Ted
"Got it. Anyway, Ted, part two of my story: my friend Kelly's going to be there.",Robin
"Kelly, who supposedly I'm gonna love?",Ted
"Oh, you are gonna love Kelly. She's fun, she's smart, she lives in the moment.",Robin
"Translation, she's ugly, she's ugly, she ugs in the ugly.",Barney
"Oh, and she's totally hot.",Robin
"Okay, I guess I can take her off your hands for an evening.",Ted
"So, do you have any other hot single fr...",Barney
"No, Kelly works with the news breakers...",Robin
"Oh, no, Ted, your blazer!",Lily
"What, what, what...?",Ted
Somebody spilled gorgeous all over it. Love it!,Lily
Thank you.,Ted
And his hair was perfect.,Barney
"Hey we're wearing the same shirt! Oh, wait no that's just my shirt reflected in yours.",Lily
"One of the twenty-four similarities between girls and fish is that they're both attracted to shiny objects. You really never read my blog, do you?",Barney
"Alright, Tin-Man. Let's hit it.",Ted
"Alright, well, have fun at your little disco, guys.",Marshall
What the hell happened to these two?,Barney
Marshall and I are just growing up.,Lily
"Yeah, it's going to be sweet, too. Like tonight we're tasting all these different wines, pairing them up with these cool gourmet cheeses...",Marshall
"Wow, who knew being committed in a heterosexual relationship could make a guy so gay.",Barney
"Alright, cool kids are leaving now. Grandma, grandpa... don't wait up.",Ted
"My, oh, my there are some ferocious looking cutlets here tonight. Alright, hookup strategy, colon, find a cutlet; lock her in early, grind with her all night till she's mine.",Barney
Do strategies ever work for you?,Ted
Question is: do these strategies ever not work for me? Either way the answer's about half the time.,Barney
My bitches! Check this out.  They're with me. ,Robin
Uh... we're her bitches too.  We'll wait here...,Bradley
"...And with todays interest rate climbing, you gotta go for the thirty year fixed mortgage.",Chris
"Oh, totally.  So, Marshall, what about you? You guys thinking house, baby?",Austin
Ah! ,Claire
"Ah, no I think we're going to wait on the baby thing. I mean I love babies. Babies rule. Pudgy arms and stuff, but they make you old. Kind of like this anchor weighing you down to one spot...forever.",Marshall
I'm three month's pregnant.,Claire
I don't know guys. It's not awkward unless we let it be awkward.,Marshall
This place seems great. Is Kelly here?,Ted
"Yeah, she's around somewhere. Let's go find her, I'll introduce you guys. Then I should probably dock into the VIP room, so stupid and arbitrary isn't it, who get's to be in VIP and who doesn't?",Robin
Can we come?,Ted
It's... not that arbitrary...,Robin
Whoa... this place in lourd!,Ted
You think?,Barney
"Okay, it's a little loud.",Barney
There's Kelly. ,Robin
You want to go somewhere we can talk?,Ted
Totally! ,Kelly
...Okay...,Ted
You think it was kind of weird that Ted didn't invite me out with him?,Marshall
"Why, you'd rather be out at some dance club, all noisy and sweaty with the... . Is that what you want? ",Lily
Is this what you want?  Thirty year fixed mortgage.  I'm three months pregnant.  That was awkward. ,Marshall
Let's start drinking!,Lily
"Oh, not so fast. In order for the tannins to mellow, you should let it breathe for about thirty minutes.",Chris
Freaking ten ends.,Marshall
Robin Scherbastky?  Robin Scherbatsky! ,Robin
"So, how do you know Robin?",Ted
Sagittarius.,Kelly
Is that near Westchester?,Ted
I would love one. Just a beer! ,Kelly
You know what they're doing in there right now? They're watching Claire's ultrasound video and I swear to god even the baby looks bored.,Marshall
"Come on, it's not that bad. We're really starting to click with these guys. Claire and Austin just invited us to their fondue fest next Saturday night.",Lily
You're also trying to get me excited about fondue?,Marshall
"It's dipping stuff in hot cheese, what's not to love?",Lily
"Okay, that does sound good. But it's dipping stuff in hot cheese with boring people.",Marshall
"Marshall, it's time for us to grow up.",Lily
Marshall knew she was right. He had to stop acting like a kid.,Narrator
"But not tonight. Now our apartment was on the third floor, so I'm not sure if this part is actually true, but Uncle Marshall swears it happened.",Narrator

"Oh, yeah. Norah Jones just gets better and better.",Claire
Please tell me we can drink the wine now.,Lily
"Five more minutes, we don't want to rush to tannins.",Chris
Freaking tannins.,Lily
"You really like this place?  You have no idea what I'm saying, do you? I'm from outer space! I got thrown out of Sea World for humping a dolphin!  I'M WETTING MY PANTS. ",Ted
"I think that's when I realized, clubs weren't awesome. Clubs weren't even okay. Clubs sucked. I had to get out of there.",Narrator
"Hey, Robin.",Marshall
Hey!,Robin
Why aren't you inside?,Marshall
"I'm calling the owner, there's a guy in there who won't let me in to the stupid VIP room. What are you doing here?",Robin
"Oh, I had this move. So I came here to bust it. Can you get me in? ",Marshall
"Great, voicemail.",Robin
"Thanks, I'll see ya.",Marshall
Bye.,Robin
"Oh, come on! He just got here!",Phil
"Oh yeah, isn't there a third Affleck Brother? Keith Affleck or Brian Affleck or something?",Bradley
Holy Crap. We just saw Brian Affleck! ,Phil
"And it's not that I care so much about getting into the VIP room, I have been in tons of VIP rooms, not exactly a VIP room virgin.  Seriously, call me back.  Oh, um... I was just in there. Robin Scherbatsky, I'm on the list.",Robin
"But, I'm Robin Scherbatsky. I'm a reporter for channel one.",Robin
You shoulda snuck in with Brian Affleck.,Phil
"I'm bailing, see ya.",Ted
"Oh hey, I can't see her face. Is she hot?",Barney
Hi.,Woman
Nice eyes. Cute smile. Out of your league.,Ted
"Aah! Coat wench do not uncheck that man's jacket. Sorry, just being dramatic. You're not a wench.",Marshall
What are you doing here? Lily let you go?,Ted
Lily? Pfft. Who cares right?,Marshall
You are so dead.,Ted
"Oh, I'm so dead.",Marshall
Wow. Uh... I'm going home.,Ted
"Aah! I put my ass and probably other parts of my body on the line to party with my bro. Now damn it, we're gonna party.",Marshall
"Alright, one beer.",Ted
"Yes, finally I don't have to wait half an hour for a drink.",Marshall
Yeah. No tannins.,Marshall
"Oh man, I can't believe I forgot to tell you this. This is important to the story. Earlier that day, Marshall went to the dentist and got a temporary crown put in. Okay, so anyway.",Narrator
AAAGGGGGHHHHHHHHH!! ,Marshall
"Come on, let's go. ",Ted
I'm staying. ,Marshall
"Marshall, are you okay?",Lily
"Again, I wasn't there. So I'm a little foggy on the details. ",Narrator
Taxi!,Lily
Hey.,Lily
Hey.,Robin
Marshall just ditched out on our own party. Can you get me in there? I kind of need to k*ll him.,Lily
"Actually, I can't even get myself in. I was such a dork. I get recognized one time and I start thinking I'm Julia Roberts. No VIP. I'm not even an IP. I'm just a lonely little P sitting out here in the gutter.",Robin
Know something; I'd take a pee in the gutter over Julia Roberts any day. ,Lily
There's Barney. I'm leaving. ,Ted
Broke my tooth.,Marshall

Or New Year's Eve.,Ted
Or parades.,Ted
Or parades.,Ted
I really hate parades. ,Ted
"He just left, in the middle of our own party, you don't do that. Unless, of course, you're chasing after someone who's already done it, and then I think it's okay.",Lily
"Well, I hate to take his side... but come one a wine tasting? What's the big plan for next Saturday, scrabble night?",Robin
Don't check your email.,Lily
Why are you becoming this person? I heard that in college you flashed a campus tour group on a dare.,Robin
"Once on a dare. The other times were just for fun. I'm not in college anymore. I'd love to go back and be that person again, but you can't move backwards you can only go forward.",Lily
"Um, pause... you can go wherever you want. I guess the question is where do you want to go?",Robin
I want to go into this club and find my fianc√©.,Lily
Well that you can't do. ,Robin
"Wanna bet?  Follow my lead.  Hey, big guy.  I said follow my lead.",Lily
Follow my lead.,Phil
"Please, please, please.",Bradley
Those were the four greatest and only breasts I have ever seen.,Bradley
Right.,Ted
"So, by that logic, if you and I were to, say, go out on a date.",Ted
Right. The DMV it is.,Ted
"Sounds awful, it's a date.",Ted
But there's still one big question that needs to be answered.,Ted
How many of these coats do you think I could put on all at once?,Ted
"Okay, this question is for the wedge. ",Chris
Barney?? ,Woman
Barney.,Ted
"Ted, bring your coat, we're leaving.",Barney
"What? What happened to that, uh, cutlet you were grinding with?",Ted
"That was my cousin, Leslie.",Barney
What?!,Ted
"No, no, no... we are not laughing about this, Ted. This is not going to be some funny story that we'll be telling in a couple months. It's not gonna be like, Hey, remember that time when you were grinding with... NO! And you know why? Because, italics, this night did not happen. And you promise me that you will never, ever, ever tell another soul what transpired here tonight. You promise. Promise",Barney
"Alright, I promise. Let's get Marshall and go, okay.  Hey. Thanks for saving my night. I'll talk to you soon? Umm, hey... tip her, Barney.",Ted
"Why, I didn't check a coat. And even if I did, on principle tip jars have become so...",Barney
"Funny story, Barney was grinding with this girl all night...",Ted
FINE! Just... eh. ,Barney
That's a handy new trick. ,Ted
"So, Marshall and Lily rediscovered their youth. It was nice, and then it got icky. ",Narrator
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU GUYS CAME OUT TONIGHT.,Ted
"YOU KNOW DUDE, CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING? IT KIND OF HURT THAT YOU GUYS DIDN'T INVITE ME OUT  I MEAN I KNOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED SINCE I GOT ENGAGED BUT IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE TO BE ASKED.",Marshall
"I'M SORRY, I JUST ASSUMMED YOU...",Ted
THEY PLAYED SOME GOOD SONGS TONIGHT.,Barney
--HAD OTHER PLANS. I MEAN LATELY...,Ted
"I KNOW, I KNOW. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE SUDDENLY WE'RE LIVING IN TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS. MAYBE YOU'VE GOT MORE IN COMMON WITH BARNEY.",Marshall

"Oh, my god...I'm going to barf. Where's my purse, where's my purse?  I'm okay.",Lily
PROBLEM IS... YOU CAN'T DO ANY OF THAT COUPLE STUFF UNLESS YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO DO IT WITH. AND THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO FIND THAT SOMEONE IS BY GOING OUT DOING STUPID SINGLE STUFF WITH BARNEY.,Ted
WHAT?,Barney
"BUT MAN, WHEN I FIND HER. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME BADASS WINE TASTINGS.",Ted
IT'S A PLAN! HEY MAYBE IT'LL BE THAT CUTE COAT CHECK GIRL!,Marshall
"YEAH, MAYBE IT WILL BE.",Ted
It wasn't.,Narrator
"YOU KNOW, TED, I DON'T SAY THIS NEARLY ENOUGH BUT REALLY...",Marshall
THAT PLACE MAKES GREAT SALADS!,Barney
Guess what came in the mail today?,Lily
Our costumes? Do they rule?,Marshall
They rule. And yours is 100% wool so you won't get hypothermia like last year.,Lily
Tarzan nipple blue.,Marshall
"You know what I love about Halloween? It's the one night of the year chicks use to unleash their inner ho-bag. If a girl dresses up as she a witch, she's a slutty witch. If she's a cat, she's a slutty cat. If she's a nurse...",Barney
She's a slutty nurse.,Barney
"Robin, what are you doing for Halloween?",Marshall
"Oh, I don't know. Probably hanging out with Mike, this guy I've been seeing.",Robin
Mike? There's a Mike? You have a boyfriend? You haven't told us?,Lily
"No, I mean, he's not my boyfriend. He's just this guy I've been seeing for a couple of weeks.",Robin
So why haven't we met him?,Marshall
We're not really ready to go public yet.,Robin
How about we go about a Halloween double-date?,Lily
"I don't know, we were kinda thinking about staying at home and dressing up as naked people.",Robin
"Come on, Robin, trot our your new fella. Let us judge and evaluate him behind your back. It'll be fun.",Lily
"Hey, Ted, you'll never guess what happened?",Marshall
Your costumes came.,Ted
"Our costumes...yes, that is why we're best friends.",Marshall
"Hey, Ted, what are you doing for Halloween?",Robin
Well.,Ted
What?,Robin
Every Halloween Ted waits for the Slutty Pumpkin.,Lily
That's right.,Ted
What's the Slutty Pumpkin?,Robin
"You mean, who is the Slutty Pumpkin? It was four years ago.",Ted
I was at this Halloween party up on the roof of our building. I'm about to call it an early night when out of nowhere appeared this girl in the sexiest pumpkin costume.,Ted
"Wait, how can a pumpkin costume be sexy?",Robin
It was carved in strategic places.,Ted
"So, uh, we're at the bar and I see her mix kahlua...",Ted
Kahlua and root beer,Lily

And she...,Ted
And she called it the Tootsie Roll.,Barney
"Hey, can I please tell this story? So we had this instant connection. She gave me her number, but then something...",Ted
Guys! Something went terribly wrong.,Ted
Happy Halloween.,Lily
"Sonny, where's Cher?",Ted
Cher?,Lily
"Right here, babe.",Marshall
I just met the perfect woman. She's funny. She's beautiful. She loves Star Wars.,Ted
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. What's her take on Ewoks?,Marshall
Loves them.,Ted
Oh good. I don't know why people are so cynical about Ewoks. The Rebellion would have failed without the Ewoks.,Marshall
"Get this, she's a marine biologist. She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.",Ted
"Oh, penguins are cool, kinda like black and white Ewoks. I approve.",Marshall
"Hey, where's my, uh, Kit Kat? I put it right here on this table.",Ted
"I don't know, but we have plenty of chocolate here.",Lily
"No no no, you don't understand. I need that Kit Kat. She wrote her number on that wrapper. Where is it?",Ted
Uh-oh.,Lily
"Hey, Dracula. Come on. Give me your candy. Gimme!",Ted
Where's the Kit Kat? Where's the Kit Kat!,Ted
"Never found her number, never saw her again. But every year they have a Halloween party up on the roof so that's where I'll be.",Ted
"You know, Ted, it's been four years. She could be engaged or married or, God forbid, fat.",Barney
"I don't know, I got a feeling. This could be the year. Halloween is a night of wonder and magic.",Ted
"OK, bring the mockery. Fine, I can take it. Come on, wouldn't it be the coolest story ever if the Slutty Pumpkin turned out to be my future wife?",Ted
"Oh, on the off chance that that could happen, maybe we should stop calling her the Slutty Pumpkin.",Lily
Can't wait.,Ted
"So, what do you think?",Marshall
nan,Lily
"Wow! Marshall, you wearing eye liner?",Ted
"Oh, yeah. Weirdly hot, right?",Marshall
We are so gonna win the costume contest this year.,Lily
"First prize, $50 gift certificate at the bar.",Marshall
And how much did you pay for your costumes?,Ted
$100,Marshall
(,Lily
"Well, I think you guys look great.",Ted
"What are you going as? Oh, like I even have to ask.",Lily
"Hey, I want the Slutty Pumpkin to recognize me and she knows me as a hanging chad.",Ted
What? She thought it was hilarious.,Ted
"Yeah, four years ago, but nobody remembers what the hell a hanging chad is.",Lily
What a sad commentary on our national attention span that we could forget such a turbulent time in our political history.,Marshall
"All right, Polly gotta pee.",Lily
Again?,Marshall
Where are you going?,Ted
It's an elaborate costume.,Marshall
"No, no, not again. Not this year. You're going as my wingman. Flight suit up!",Barney
No thanks. I'm sticking with the hanging chad.,Ted
"Oh you're dangerous, Maverick. Your ego's writing check your body can't cash. OK. Here's the plan, and I crap you not. I'm getting us into the Victoria's Secret Halloween party. Trust me, by the end of the night, your chad will not be hanging.",Barney
"We can get rejected by supermodels any night of the year. Tonight, I'm going up to the roof, I'm gonna have a few beers, I'm gonna wait for the Slutty Pumpkin. That's just what I do.",Ted
"Hm,  Victoria's Secret models prancing around in bras and panties, or  Yale preppies reuniting their stupid a capella group. What's that left hand? Right hand sucks? Word.",Barney
I'm heading up to the roof.,Ted
"Well, boys, looks like it's just the three of us. What's that? Self-five? Nice.  We out.",Barney
"Hey, Chad, how's it hanging?",Robin
"Hey, word play. Funny.",Ted
nan,Robin
nan,Robin
I'm a parrot.,Lily
You sure are.,Robin
Where's Mike?,Lily
He's meeting me here. I ran late covering the Halloween parade in the Village. There are like a zillion gay pirates this year.,Robin
"Seriously, does my eye liner look OK?",Marshall
"Yes, it's weirdly hot.",Lily
"Uh, you know, Mike and I joked about doing something together but we decided not to dress up.",Robin
"Oh, geez.",Robin
Hi.,Mike
"Ah, everyone, this is Michael. Th-that is not his real hair.",Robin
"Where's your costume, Gretel?",Mike
"You thought I was...Oh, I was just kidding. I gotta stop making jokes in e-mails. It's so hard to convey tone.",Robin
I can't believe you talked me into this.,Barney
I didn't. You followed me up here.,Ted
This party sucks. There are seven chicks here.,Barney
There are six chicks here.,Barney
"Relax, the night is young. It's gonna get better.",Ted
My bonnie lies over the ocean. My bonnie lies over the sea. My bonnie lives over the ocean. Oh bring back my bonnie to me...,Shagarats
Arr-gyle.,Lily
Arrr-by's,Lily
Actually I kinda need this hand to eat.,Robin
Oh.,Mike
"It's so nice to meet you, Mike. You guys are really cute together.",Lily
"Yeah, we've been spending a lot of time together. We're even getting to that point where we finish each other's ",Mike
This cheeseburger is so...,Robin
Good. See.,Mike
"I think you won the dish-off tonight, baby. This steak totally bitch-slapped my pork chop.",Lily
That might be true but your rice pilaf kicked my spinach in the crotch so hard it threw up a little bit.,Marshall
nan,Mike
"Oh, well, that's good. I'm OK, thanks.",Robin
Really tasty.,Mike
I'm just really feeling this cheeseburger.,Robin
"Come on, just try a little bite.",Mike
"Dude, I'm kind of in the zone here.",Robin
Oh for God's sake. ,Lily
Really tasty.,Lily
Hey.,Barney
"So, what does a fella have to do to get lei'd around here? Yeah.",Barney
It isn't funny if you explain the joke.,Barney
Let's bail.,Barney
"Oh, Barney, come on, I'm having fun. It's really great seeing these guys again.",Ted
Name one person you know at this party.,Barney
"Well, there's ninja, back of horse. Where's front of horse? That guys a riot. Where is he?",Ted
"OK, I'm leaving, but just know that this Victoria's Secret party is on a yacht. And what will be sticking to that yacht? The Barnacle. ",Barney
Really? That's the nickname now?,Ted
"Yeah, the Barnacle.",Barney
The Barnacle.,Ted
That's it. Barnacle out. ,Barney
"Have fun, Barnacle.",Ted
"So, do you like Mike?",Robin
Do you like Mike?,Lily
Of course I do. Why?,Robin
It just doesn't seem like it. You won't share your food. You won't wear a costume.,Lily
"Ah, Lily, you know me, I'm just not into all that couple-y stuff.",Robin
"OK, I know that stuff looks dumb from the outside, but it's kinda the greatest thing in the world when you're a part of it. If you just give it a chance, you might like it.",Lily
Are you trying to get me to join a cult?,Robin
"Robin, Mike likes you. If you don't start meeting him halfway, you're gonna lose him.",Lily
What?,Robin
"Look, it's Halloween. Just put on the girlfriend costume for the night.",Lily
"OK, what am I supposed to do? Buy him a giant teddy bear or something?",Robin
How about you start by sharing dessert.,Lily
"I can share dessert. He better want the brownie sundae, but yeah, yeah, I can totally share.",Robin
"Barney. What, you're back?",Ted
That's right.,Barney
In a totally new costume.,Ted
"Every Halloween, I bring a spare costume in case I strike out with the hottest girl at the party. That way I have a second chance to make a first impression.",Barney
What's with the face?,Barney
"It's half you're pathetic, half I have to pee.",Ted
So go to the bathroom.,Barney
"No, there's a huge line. I don't want to miss the Slutty Pumpkin.",Ted
"So pee off the roof. Ooh, Ted, pee off the roof.",Barney
"Come on, Ted, who are you going to listen to? Me or Mr. Goody-goody over there.",Barney
"A little to the left, Marshall. Lily, squat down.",Robin
This is gonna be a slaughter. None of these other costumes even come close to ours.,Marshall
Take the damn picture. (,Lily
Got it.,Robin
I still think we should have won as Sonny and Cher. Maybe if I had worn that red dress. Ha! If I could turn back time.,Marshall
"Wow, this sundae looks so good I could eat the whole thing.",Robin
"But, um, I would much rather share this small, one-scoop sundae with you, Mike.",Robin
"Apple tart, excellent choice, Lilypad.",Marshall
"Thanks, Marshmallow.",Lily
"Well, let's dig in, Mi... Mi... Microwave Oven.",Robin
Let me guess. Every guy has used the lei'd line on you tonight.,Barney
I apologize for my gender. Let me make it up to you. Make you a drink.,Barney
I'm also a horny devil.  Yeah.,Barney
"You know, if you guys like tiramisu we found this little Italian place...",Mike
"No, you found it. I came with you. Go on.",Robin
I'm just saying we love tiramisu.,Mike
I cannot get enough of it.,Robin
We're crazy for this stuff.,Mike
I'm crazy and you're crazy for tiramisu.,Robin
We love tiramisu. Am I wrong in saying that.?,Mike
"No, no, no, I mean it just sounds a little bit weird, doesn't it? We love tiramisu. Is it really a group activity, loving tiramisu? Right?",Robin
So this Italian place? How's their cannoli?,Marshall
"See there, hungry.",Robin
"Yeah, looks like we're both hungry.",Mike
"Hey, is that Gary Oldman? ",Robin
"Wait, where?",Mike
I don't see...,Mike
Brain freeze.,Robin
OK Victoria's Secret party right now.,Barney
Nope.,Ted
"Come on, I can't stand to watching my delusional friend waste another precious Halloween. The Slutty Pumpkin is not coming.",Barney
She might.,Ted
Oy.,Barney
"Come on, Barney, this is not about the odds, this is about believing. This girl, she represents something to me, I don't know, hope.",Ted
Wow. I did not understand a word you just said. Lingerie models on a boat!,Barney
nan,Ted
"No, see ya. ",Barney
Wanna drink the melty part?,Robin
"You know what, it's getting late. I think I'm gonna take off.",Mike
"Hey, I thought we were gonna follow those bread crumbs back to my place, Hansel",Robin
"Robin, I don't get the sense you like being with me.",Mike
I like being with you.,Robin
"Not as much as you like being alone. You like eating your own food, sleeping in your own bed, doing your own crosswords.",Mike
"Well, who uses ink? Sorry. OK, I'm a bit set in my ways. That doesn't mean that this won't work.",Robin
"Actually, it kinda does.",Mike
"Wait, are we breaking up?",Robin
We aren't breaking up. I'm breaking up with you.,Mike
She spent a year in Antarctica studying penguins.,Ted
"Uh, excuse me, this is gonna sound crazy, but I met someone up on this roof four years ago and they mixed that cocktail and they loved penguins. By any chance, was that you? It's you. I was crazy but I can't...",Ted
"You are such a loser. Come on, I came back for you, Ted. I penguin-suited up to show you the error of your ways. And to score hula girl's number. Check and check.",Barney
Unbelievable.,Ted
"Yes, it is.",Barney
"What? No no, that's some other guy and he was a kick-ass fighter pilot",Barney
"Yeah, well, you did, thanks.",Barney
"Uh, I don't think so. I earned it fair and square. I'm calling you.",Barney
But how will you know it's me? I'm a master of disguise. Yeah.,Barney
Nice.,Ted
"Come on, Ted, Victoria's Secret party now. Let's go.",Barney
I'm staying.,Ted
Fine. Fine. ,Barney
What are you doing?,Ted
I'm flippering you off.,Barney
"Sweetie, I'm so sorry.",Lily
"Seriously it's not a big deal. He wanted to be a 'we,' and I wanted to be an 'I'. Dudes are such chicks. You guys, I'm fine.",Robin
"Ladies and gentlemen, the results are in. And the winners of this year's costume contest are Lily Aldrin as a parrot and Marshall Eriksen as a gay pirate.",Carl
Oh yeah!,Marshall
Wait. What did he say?,Marshall
"Oh, who cares, Marshall? We won!",Lily
"Gay pirate, where are you getting that from?",Marshall
"Dude, you're wearing eye liner.",Carl
"OK, I just want everybody here to know that I'm not a gay pirate. I have sex with my parrot all the time. That came out wrong. Oh yeah, it doesn't matter! We won!",Marshall
"I love you, Marshmallow.",Lily
"I love you too, Lilypad.",Marshall
"You guys, let me get a picture.",Robin
I had a feeling I'd find you here.,Robin
"Hey. If you're here for the Shagarats, you just missed the fourth encore.",Ted
I never played any team sports,Robin
Are we playing 'I never' cuz there's nothing left but peach schnapps.,Ted
I played tennis in high school. You know why? Because it was just me out there. I couldn't even stand playing doubles. I just got dumped.,Robin
"Man, that sucks.",Ted
"Yeah, it's OK. I wasn't that into him. Story of my life. Everyone else is all falling in love and acting stupid and goofy and sweet and insane, but not me. Why don't I want that more? I want to want that. Am I wired wrong or something?",Robin
"No. Look, you didn't want to be with me so clearly you have abysmal taste in men.",Ted
But you're wired just fine.,Ted
"Well, what if I'm just a cold person? Tonight, Mike was willing to look like a complete idiot for me, but I couldn't be Gretel. Why can't I be Gretel?",Robin
Because you just haven't met the right Hansel yet. One day you're gonna meet a guy who's gonna make you want to look like a complete idiot.,Ted
Really?,Robin
"Yeah, he's out there somewhere, just like the Slutty Pumpkin.  pumpkin-pumpkin...",Ted
"How do you do this, Ted? How do you sit out here all night on the roof in the cold and still have faith your pumpkin's gonna show up.",Robin
"Well, I'm pretty drunk. Look, I know that odds are the love of my life isn't going to magically walk through that door in a pumpkin costume at 2:43 in the morning but it seems as nice a spot as any to just, you know, sit and wait.",Ted
Scoot.,Robin
"Wow, that was a great story, Dad.",Daughter
We're gonna go watch TV.,Son
Oh my God.,Marshall
"I know, I'm still shaking.",Lily
"What the? Haha, joke's on you, I have a cold.",Barney
Are you guys OK? Marshall : Another round and back it up for me and Lily.,Robin
What happened?,Ted
"We saw something, up in the apartment.",Marshall
Something bad.,Lily
"I don't know what it is, but margaritas make me sexy.",Marshall
"Oh, mucho sexy. You quiero Marshall.",Lily
Oh my God.,Lily
What was it?,Ted
"Only the craziest, meanest looking mouse you've ever seen.",Marshall
"Mouse? Sweetie, that wasn't a mouse. That was a huge cockroach.",Lily
"Baby, it was a mouse. It had a whiskers.",Marshall
"But those things coming out of his head, those were antennae",Lily
Marshall ran away from a cockroach.,Barney
"It, it was a mouse.",Marshall
"Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad. You're a man.",Barney
"Ooh, my story's on. Ted, pay attention. Carl, turn it up.",Robin
"I'm here with Ellen Pierce, New York's premiere matchmaker. Ellen, your company, Love Solutions boasts a 100% success rate. What's your secret?",Robin
"Science. Everything in life can be broken down to ones and zeros, even love.",Ellen
"Love Solution's Ellen Pierce, a beacon of hope for New York city's lovelorn. Robin Scherbatsky...",Robin
Was that chick at the end really a client?,Barney
Yes.,Robin
We're signing up.,Barney
What?,Ted
"Ted, these chicks are desperate and hot. That's a perfect cocktail. Shake well, then sleep with.",Barney
I'm not going to a matchmaker. That's like giving up. It's the man version of getting a cat.,Ted
"No, it wasn't a cockroach. It had fur and only mammals have fur.",Marshall
It was a cockroach.,Lily
"Come on, Lily, the only way that that was a cockroach was if it was wearing the skin of a mouse it just k*ll.",Marshall
Oh my God.,Lily
Come on.,Barney
"Ted, hurry, you gotta help me. My boat is sinking.",Barney
What?,Ted
My boat is sinking.,Barney
You have a boat?,Ted
Your boat is sinking. That was good.,Ted
"Come on, Ted, this is an incredible opportunity. We'll meet our soulmates, nail 'em and never call them again. ",Barney
"All finished, gentlemen? Congratulations, you have just taken your very first step.",Ellen
"Gosh, thanks, Ellen. I sure hope this works. I'm so done with the single life, all the games, the meaningless sex.",Barney
You deserve more.,Ellen
"That is so true, Ellen. I really think I'm ready to stop being a me and start being a we.",Barney
"Oh, of course you can. That is so...",Ellen
"It's kinda hard to talk about with Ted here, but I just want someone who's not afraid to hold me at night when the tears come. Ellen, can you help me find her?",Barney
Get out.,Ellen
What?,Barney
"I get 15 guys like you every week. Jerks who just want to meet vulnerable women, nail 'em and never call them again.",Ellen
"Oh my God, people do that.",Barney
You wanna do this the easy way or the hard way?,Ellen
What's the hard way? Security roughs me up and tosses me out?,Barney
That's the easy way. The hard way is that I stomp the crap out of you myself.,Ellen
"OK, Ted, let's go.",Barney
"Not you, you stay.",Ellen
"You're cute. You're an architect. Good career and you didn't use an obvious alias on your application like your friend, Jack Package.",Ellen
Get outta here!,Ellen
You I can work with. You give me three days and I will find the woman you will marry.,Ellen
"Ah, no thanks. I don't need an algorithm to meet women. It's New York City. You know, plenty of fish in the sea.",Ted
"Plenty of fish in the sea. Yes, there's 9 million people in New York, 4.5 million women. Of course you wanna meet someone roughly your own age, let's say, plus minus 5 years. So if we take into account the most recent census data, that leaves us with 482,000. But, uh, wait",Ellen
"That can't be right. Eight? Really, eight?",Ted
"There are 8 fish in that big, blue ocean, Ted. And if you feel confident that you can reel one into your boat without me, there's the door.",Ellen
Do you take credit cards?,Ted
"OK, it's back and this time we got a good look.",Lily
"Hey, seriously, you have to stop doing that.",Barney
It's bigger now. It's been feeding.,Marshall
We were just upstairs watching TV.,Lily
Ah gosh.,Marshall
"OK, let's do this.",Lily
"Shh, shh, it's OK, it's over.",Marshall
So did you get a good look at it?,Barney
"Yeah. It has six legs, a hard exoskeleton like a roach...",Lily
"But it has mouse-like characteristics. Grey-brown tufts of fur, a tail.",Marshall
"So which is it, a cockroach or a mouse?",Robin
It's a cockamouse.,Lily
What?,Robin
It's some sort of mutant combination of the two. It's as if a cockroach and a mouse...you know...,Lily
Hit the horizontal ten-legged interspecies cha-cha?,Barney
That's impossible. That simply can't happen.,Robin
"Oh, but it can.",Lily
And it has,Marshall
And it's pissed.,Lily
"Dude, is everything OK? You left the front door open.",Ted
There was no time.,Marshall
"So Love Solutions, did you meet the love of your life?",Robin
She said it'd take three days. It's been five days. Should I be worried?,Ted
"Oh, just play it cool. Don't Ted out about it.",Lily
Did you just use my name as a verb?,Ted
"Oh, yeah, we do that behind your back. Ted-out: to overthink. Also see Ted-up. Ted-up: to overthink something with disastrous results. Sample sentence: Billy Tedded up when",Barney
"OK, I get it. Don't worry, I'm not gonna ted anything up or out. I'll just give it a few more days.",Ted
"Hi, Ellen. Remember me? I'm Ted.",Ted
"Ted, hi. I meant to call you. The computer is still crunching the numbers. Busy as a bee, that little computer.",Ellen
You said it was gonna be three days.,Ted
Did I?,Ellen
Hm.,Ted
Three days? Really?,Ellen
"Yeah. When someone says you're gonna meet the perfect woman in three days, you gotta put that in your datebook, so...",Ted
"How do I say this? This is gonna be really hard. Ted, there are absolutely no women out there for you. Phew, actually I got through that OK.",Ellen
There are no women for me out there? I thought you said there were 8.,Ted
I know. There are supposed to be. I don't know where they are.,Ellen
"But, I'm an architect. And you said I'm cute. I'm a cute architect.",Ted
How do you think I feel? I have a 100% success rate. It's my hook. I could probably find somebody for you if you were gay.,Ellen
"Well, I'm not.",Ted
A little bi maybe?,Ellen
"No. You're messing with me, right?",Ted
Come see for yourself.,Ellen
"I cannot set you up unless you have a compatibility rating of 7.0 or higher, and look, 5.4, 4.8, 5.6...",Ellen
There's a 9.6 right there.,Ted
"Don't touch the computer. Yes, Sarah O'Brien. I fixed her up six months ago. She would have been absolutely perfect for you.",Ellen
What about the guy you set her up with? Is he a 9.6 compatibility rating?,Ted
8.5.,Ellen
So he sucks.,Ted
"No, 8.5 is an extremely good match-up quotient.",Ellen
"Oh, sure, it's good. It's solid. But a 9.6?",Ted
"Yes, 9.6 is off the charts, but Sarah is matched up. Ted, look, I have a lunch. Please. I promise we will find you somebody. Don't lose hope. There are new women turning 18 every day.",Ellen
He's a whole new species. The cockamouse.,Lily
And it's the size of a potato.,Marshall
"So, what, now it's a cockapotatomouse?",Robin
Don't make it sound ridiculous. It's a cockamouse.,Marshall
"My God, this is incredible. We're like the same person. Sarah O'Brien loves brunch.",Ted
"Wow, Ted, sounds like you're her perfect woman.",Barney
And like the majestic seahorse it's hermaphroditic.,Marshall
Obviously the whole thing is shrouded in mystery.,Lily
"For as much as we know about the cockamousse, there are still so much we don't know.",Marshall
"Well, we know that there's no such thing as a cockamouse. What we don't know is what you guys have been smoking.",Robin
So you really don't believe in the cockamouse?,Marshall
"Well, I believe that you saw something perfectly normal but you've exaggerated it in your mind, you know, um, like the Loch Ness Monster.",Robin
"If by 'like the Loch Ness Monster,' you mean, totally exists and is awesome, then yeah, it's like the Loch Ness monster.",Marshall
"It's diet is not unlike our own, grains, cereals and it's awfully fond of cheese...",Marshall
"OK, this is getting weird, the similarities go on and on. She hates phonies. I totally hate phonies too. She's a dermatologist. I have skin.",Ted
You wanna be her boyfriend. She already has a boyfriend. It's uncanny.,Barney
"All right, but it wouldn't hurt to check her out, right? See what my 9.6 looks like in person, as, you know, a frame of reference. And if she thinks she can do 11.45% better, who am I to deny her that?",Ted
Hi.,Ted
"Hi, I'm Dr. O'Brien.",Sarah
I'm Architect Mosby. Sorry I just wanted to say my job too.,Ted
"Hi, I'm Ted.",Ted
"So, what are we doing today?",Sarah
I have a kind of mole on my back. It's probably nothing but I'm a cautious guy.,Ted
I'm exactly the same.,Sarah
"Sorry about that, Summer Breeze is my guilty pleasure song.",Ted
"Oh, it's been stuck in my head ever since I heard it this weekend at brunch.",Ted
I love brunch.,Sarah
"It's the best, as long as I don't have to spend it with a bunch of phonies.",Ted
"I like the way you think, Architect Mosby.",Sarah
"Hey, this may sound weird but it'll definitely sound more weird once my shirt's off so I'm gonna ask you now. Do you wanna have dinner with me Saturday night?",Ted
"Oh, that's very sweet, but I'm actually getting married on Saturday.",Sarah
Friday night?,Ted
"Wow, you're getting married. Congratulations.",Ted
Thank you.,Sarah
I'm really sorry I asked you out. If just felt like there might be this weird connection between us. How crazy am I coming off here?,Ted
Only a little.,Sarah
"Well, by some million to one sh*t, and I'm not rooting for this, you wind up not getting married this weekend, give me a call.",Ted
"OK, but it's not likely. I look damn good in my dress.",Sarah
I'm sure you do.,Ted
"Wow, that's a pretty sophisticated trap. You think the road runner's gonna fall for it?",Robin
"OK, we get it. You're skeptical. But Marshall and I, we're believers. We believe.",Lily
"Yeah, look around. The universe is mysterious and awesome. You got the Bermuda triangle, ghosts, Big Foot.",Marshall
Bad maps. Creaky houses. Hillbilly in a gorilla suit.,Robin
Aliens.,Marshall
"Oh, come one, you gotta give me aliens. Stonehenge. Area 51. There's alien crap all over the place.",Marshall
You can't be serious.,Robin
"My friend, you just poked the bear.",Marshall
"So, my 9.6, beautiful, charming, intelligent, engaged.",Ted
Oh.,Robin
"Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry.",Lily
"Yeah, it was a long sh*t. I told her to call me anyway if she changes her mine, but I don't know...",Ted
"Whoa whoa whoa, let's not skip over this. Raise your hand if earlier today you hit on an engaged woman.",Lily
"Come on, Lily, don't hate the player, hate the game.",Barney
"On the night of July 2nd, 1947, conditions were clear over Roswell, New Mexico.",Marshall
Oh geez.,Robin
"Oh, hey, Ted, there's a message on the machine for you. Dr. O'Brien.",Marshall
What?,Ted
"When suddenly, an array of",Marshall
The doctor will see you now.,Barney
"What should I do? I should totally go down there, right?",Ted
Don't interfere. Some guy is expecting to marry this woman on Saturday.,Lily
"Yeah, an 8.5 guy. Look, if I was marrying the wrong person and the right person was out there and knew it, I'd want that person to come down to my dermatology office and tell me so.",Ted
Happy ending.,Barney
"Look, I have to go down there. I don't know what's gonna happen when I get there but I have to give it a sh*t.",Ted
"All right, see you later. Happy hunting.",Barney
"Wait, where are you guys going? Don't you want to stay and see the cockamouse.",Lily
"Yeah, we're gonna make some crop circles.",Barney
Oh my God!,Marshall
Holy crap. We got it! What do we do with it?,Lily
"Calm down, I have a plan. I told my friend, Sudeep, about it. He wants to show it to the Columbia biology department. But it has to be alive.",Marshall
"Wait, no no. They'll do lab experiments on it. That's so mean. Shouldn't we just b*at it to death with a bat?",Lily
Hello again.,Ted
I'm glad you came down. I would prefer to say this to you in person.,Sarah
"Go ahead, Sarah, you can tell me anything.",Ted
You have a basal cell carcinoma.,Sarah
Anything else?,Ted
"Your mole. The biopsy came back. It's not life-threatening, but we should excise the rest of it.",Sarah
"Wait, then you're still getting married.",Ted
Of course I'm still getting married.,Sarah
But we're a 9.6.,Ted
Excuse me.,Sarah
"OK, I, I went to Love Solutions and I saw on Ellen Pierce's computer that you and I are a 9.6. Your fiance's only an 8.5.",Ted
You looked at my file.,Sarah
I had to. You're my only match. Aren't you even a little curious? The woman who set you up with your fianc√© thinks we're a better match.,Ted
I am getting married on Saturday.,Sarah
Ted.,Sarah
"Look, don't you think you're being a little impulsive marrying a guy you just met a few months ago?",Ted
Don't you think it's a little impulsive for you to proposition an engaged woman you don't even know?,Sarah
"See, we're both impulsive. We're perfect for each other.",Ted
"Ted, just calm down.",Sarah
Calm down! You're my only match! There was a computer and there were 8 fish in the sea full of lesbians.,Ted
"Ted, Ted, do you honestly believe deep down that there is no one else out there for you just because some computer says so.",Sarah
"Didn't used to. There was math, I got confused.",Ted
"Love isn't a science. You can't calculate a feeling. When you fall in love with someone, 8.5 equals a perfect 10.",Sarah
You're right.,Ted
"If this thing is what you say it is, it could be huge for my career.",Sudeep
"Brace yourself, dude. This is gonna blow your mind hold.",Marshall
"You bastard, I actually got excited about this.",Sudeep
What?,Marshall
It's empty.,Sudeep
"Wait, but if it's not here, that means...Lily.",Marshall
Robin.,Lily
What?,Robin
Oh my God. It's real.,Robin
"Oh, is it? Do something.",Lily
What the hell was that? You trying to get it drunk?,Lily
It was the only think I could think of.,Robin
Lily thank God.,Marshall
"Lily, I love you.",Marshall
"Robin, open the window!",Marshall
It can fly.,Robin
"Be free, mutant beast. I'll miss this private w*r of ours. I grew to admire your tenacious...Oh my God, it's headed this way.",Marshall
Hi Ellen. I think I want my money back.,Ted
"I'm a failure. I'm all washed up. I tried everything, Ted. I widened the search parameters. I tweaked the program. Last night, I stood out on the street for five hours showing your photo to random pedestrians, no takers. Although this tr*nsv*stite hooker said he/she would do you for half price because you kinda look like John Cusack and his/her favorite movie was Say Anything.",Ellen
"Come on, Ellen, I mean, a pint of ice cream isn't that a bit clich√©?",Ted
It's for the bourbon.,Ellen
This isn't hopeless. You're gonna find someone for me.,Ted
"No, I won't. You're gonna die alone.",Ellen
"I'm not gonna die alone. Look at me. I'm bright, I'm attractive. You just have to get back out there and keep looking.",Ted
"No, you're never gonna find anybody. And every year, you're just getting older and it's getting harder and harder.",Ellen
You're being ridiculous. I'm gonna be up on that wall one of these days.,Ted
No you won't.,Ellen
Yes I will,Ted
"How do you know? Ted: I don't know, but I believe. Hell, if a cockroach and a mouse can find love in this crazy city, then, dammit, so can I.",Ellen
You're losing me.,Ellen
"Point is, something good is going to happen to me. Maybe your computer will help, maybe it won't, but it'll happen.",Ted
So I should keep looking?,Ellen
Of course you should. And now you're gonna do it for free.,Ted
"Sorry, Mr. Madsen.",Lily
Plugging in.,Ted
Saving game.,Marshall
You guys will never believe what just happened to us.,Lily
I don't even believe it myself.,Robin
We were in Queens and we decided to stop by my apartment.,Lily
"Wait, her apartment? I thought Aunt Lily lived with you and Uncle Marshall.",Daughter
I could see how you would think that but I have to have my own place. It's an independence thing.,Lily
When was the last time you were there?,Robin
Three months ago.,Lily
What? It's like fat pants. You hope you never have to use 'em but you're glad to know they're there.,Lily
What the hell?,Lily
What?,Robin
This is my apartment.,Lily
Where?,Robin
Right here.,Lily
What the hell?,Lily
"Lily, this is a Chinese restaurant.",Robin
"No, no, this was my apartment. My dresser was right...",Lily
That's my dresser! And this is my closet.,Lily
"Hi, how many?",Waitress
"Yes, you know me?",Lily
"Yeah, from your homecoming picture. You're much prettier in person.",Waitress
"Yeah, I know, the bangs were a mistake. Where's my stuff? Waitress: It's all in the back. We could wrap it up for you. You want it to go?",Lily
This is my apartment!,Lily
Not anymore.,Waitress
No way. You're making this up.,Ted
"Yeah, the building would have had to give you some sort of notice.",Marshall
They sent you a notice about this.,Waitress
When?,Lily
Three months ago. Here's your mail minus the magazines.,Waitress
"Well, still, legally, they can't just toss you out onto the street. You have a lease.",Marshall
"OK so I didn't have a written lease as such but, but go ask my landlady, Mrs. Conroy.",Lily
She may be 98 years old but she's still...,Lily
"She's dead, isn't she?",Lily
Never even saw the bus.,Waitress
My apartment is a Chinese restaurant. What am I gonna do?,Lily
Come live with us.,Ted
Really?,Lily
Of course.,Ted
"You sure about this, Ted?",Marshall
"Yeah. I mean, you basically live here anyway. It's not like it'll change anything.",Ted
"No, it's like it'll change everything. Oh, Ted, you are so screwed.",Barney
What? What are you talking about?,Ted
And why is that girl checking you out?,Robin
"Because I look good. Now focus, you and Marshall are roommates. You have an amazing apartment. Marshall and Lily just got engaged",Barney
"Yeah, so?",Ted
"So, you're not still gonna be his roommate when he gets married, are you? Someone's going to move out. So who's it gonna be?",Barney
"Come on, Barney, I'm sure they've talked about who gets the apartment. You talked about who gets the apartment, right?",Robin
"Yeah, we've talked about it.",Ted
"So, when Lily and I get married, who's gonna get the apartment?",Marshall
"Oh, that's a tough one. You know who I think could handle a problem like that?",Ted
Who?,Marshall
Future Ted and Future Marshall.,Ted
Totally. Let's let those guys handle it.,Marshall
Dammit Past Ted,Ted
"You blew it, dude. Now that Lily's there, it's a whole new dynamic. They're edging you out.",Barney
That's crazy. They're not edging me out. Marshall's my best friend.,Ted
One of my best friends. He wouldn't do that to me.,Ted
"Just keep your eyes open. That's all I'm saying, Ted. Little things are gonna be changing around that apartment.",Barney
"Come on, Barney, you're just being paranoid. OK, seriously, what is this girl's deal?",Robin
Sort of on a date with her.,Barney
What?,Ted
"I found her online. I'm tired of the whole bar scene, the one-night hookups. I'm looking for a soul-mate, someone who I can love and cuddle, or so it says in my profile.  But this girl, she wants the same stuff and it's bumming me out. All right, Ted, call me from the hospital.",Barney
All right.,Ted
You're going to the hospital?,Robin
"No, see, he's gonna go back over there and I'm gonna call him and he's gonna pretend that it's an emergency call from a family member at the hospital.",Ted
"Oh, Lord, fake emergency? That is lamest, most pathetic cop-out in the book. I expect more from you, Barney.",Robin
"Well, stay tuned, I'm working on some stuff. But in the meantime, wish me luck.",Barney
"So, are you gonna talk to Marshall?",Robin
"He's gonna want the apartment. I'm gonna want the apartment. It's gonna lead to an argument, so no.",Ted
"Hm, that's real healthy. So, when a serious issue comes up, your response is just to avoid it.",Robin
I should really make this call.,Ted
"Ooh, can I do it?",Robin
"Hello? Robin: Hi there, sexy.",Barney
"Hello, Aunt Kathy, what's up?",Barney
"Oh, nothing. Just sitting here, thinking about you, hot stuff.",Robin
"An accident? Well, is Uncle Rudy gonna be OK? Robin: Aunt Kathy's got an itch that only you can scratch, big boy.",Barney
Oh God! Why did he think he could build his own helicopter?,Barney
"Come on, daddy, break me off a piece of that white chocolate.",Robin
"Well, if he needs a transplant, he can have mine. I'll be right there.",Barney
See you guys later.,Barney
"Ah, this'll be nice, the three of us living together. I think it's a good setup.",Ted
"Man, this coffee's great. It's really great. Too great.",Ted
What happened to Shocky?,Ted
"What's this? Lily: My coffeemaker from my apartment. Makes great coffee, right?",Ted
"Yeah, definitely. I mean, so does Shocky.",Ted
Really? I always thought Shocky's coffee tasted kinda rusty.,Marshall
"Yeah, no, it did. I mean, I kinda liked the rusty taste. I'm used to it. I don't know.",Ted
"Also Lily's coffeemaker doesn't, you know, shock you.",Marshall
"No. You gotta admit, that shock, wakes you up in the morning",Ted
You know what else wakes you up in the morning? Coffee.,Marshall
That's great. You're right. Roomies! I love it.,Ted
They're edging me out. They're totally edging me out. I didn't' believe it but you're right.,Ted
"Told you. That Lily, she's a shrewd one.",Barney
"Yeah, she got you a nice new coffeemaker. How dare she!",Robin
It's not just the coffeemaker.,Ted
Done. The painting's done.,Lily
That is great.,Marshall
Nice.,Ted
Where do you wanna hang it?,Marshall
"I don't know. Um, over the piano?",Lily
"Yeah, that would be a good place for it. Too bad the swords are there. We kinda love those swords.",Ted
"Well, those swords have been up there a long time.",Marshall
"I know, right? I'd really miss them too. So, maybe Marshall's room?",Ted
OK.,Lily
He was gonna take the swords down. Can you believe that?,Ted
"Ted, why don't you just talk to him? He's your best friend.",Robin
"One of your best friends. The point is, maybe it's time for some healthy communication.",Robin
"Healthy communication? That's the worst idea ever. Look, you held off their first advance. That's good. Now it's time to counter-strike.",Barney
"Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do?",Ted
"You gotta mark your territory, and I don't mean missing the toilet. You gotta do something big.",Barney
"What, like buy a new sofa?",Ted
Bigger.,Barney
"Katie's here. OK, real quick, last night, epiphany! I realized what the world of dating needs. Ready? A lemon law.",Barney
"A lemon law, like for cars.",Robin
"Exactly. From the moment the date begins you have five minutes to decide whether you're going to commit to an entire evening. And if you don't, it's no hard feelings just good night, thanks for playing, see you never. Huh? Huh? The lemon law, it's gonna be a thing, possibly starting right now.",Barney
Hi Katie. Barney.,Barney
"Hi, it's good to finally meet you.",Katie
"Hm, yeah. Katie, you are about to be a part of history.",Barney
"Man, Ted's been acting weird. He started labeling all his food. He even carved Ted into that block of cheese.",Lily
"Yeah. Well, now it's Ed's.",Marshall
He's not cool with me moving in.,Lily
"No, that's not it. I mean, you basically lived here all along. Ted loves you.",Marshall
"So, what's he PMS'ing about?",Lily
I don't know. But when he's ready to talk to me about it he'll come and talk to me about it.,Marshall
Are you kidding? You guys never talk about anything.,Lily
He'll just let it fester under the surface until he does something big and passive-aggressive.,Lily
You clearly don't know Ted.,Marshall
Your English phone booth arrived.,Marshall
"Oh, awesome. It's great, right?",Ted
"Yeah, I guess. Just not sure if Lily's gonna like it.",Marshall
"Well, I like it, so I'm just gonna keep it right here, if that's cool.",Ted
"Of course, we all live here so we should all be able to have things the way we want them.",Marshall
Exactly.,Ted
Great,Marshall
Terrific.,Marshall
You like the phone booth. It stays. I like this painting so I'm just gonna hang it...right here on the wall.,Marshall
"Oh, so it's like that, is it?",Ted
"Bring, bring.",Marshall
"Yeah, it's like that.",Marshall
I want this apartment.,Ted
"Well, I want it too.",Marshall
"No, I'm a visionary. Lemon law, it's gonna be a thing!",Barney
"For the record, your little lemon law is a symbol of everything that's wrong with our no-attention span society.",Robin
"No, wrong, lemon law is awesome.",Barney
"It takes longer than five minutes to really get to know someone. You keep giving up on people so quickly, you're gonna miss out on something great.",Robin
"OK, you're on a blind date, sitting across the table is that guy.",Barney
You really think it'll take more than five minutes to realize there will be no date number two?,Barney
"Yes I do. For all I know, that guy's my soul-mate.",Robin
"Bad move, Scherbatsky.",Barney
"Hi, have you met Robin?",Barney
Hi.,Kevin
Hi.,Robin
"All right Marshall, we're deciding right now who gets this apartment. It may lead to an argument, but we're settling this.",Ted
Or we could flip a coin.,Marshall
"Yeah, let's flip a coin.",Ted
Flip it.,Marshall
"OK, I'm flipping it, here I go.",Ted
Flip it.,Marshall
"OK, here I go.",Ted
Flip it.,Marshall
"I'm flipping. But before I do, I just wanna say something. You didn't even wanna move in here in the first place. You said a pre-war building was bad for your allergies.",Ted
That was five years ago. Now you can get prescription-level antihistamines over the counter. Oh snap. What else you got?,Marshall
"OK, I'm flipping. Heads or tails.",Ted
You don't need two rooms,Marshall
"Heads or tails, Marshall. Like you need two rooms?",Ted
We might be starting a family soon.,Marshall
"Oh, no you're not. There's no way you're having a baby while you're in law school. It's gonna be at least three years.",Ted
"It could be sooner, we're not that careful with our birth control Two-zip.",Marshall
"Oh, come on, you know damn well I move out that room's going unused.",Ted
"Oh, and I suppose you'll get a new roommate? Who's it gonna be? Barney? You know he cooks naked.",Marshall
"Yeah, well, at least Barney wouldn't take the swords down.",Ted
We were bros! These swords represent our bro-hood. And you took 'em down to make room for your fiance's stupid painting?,Ted
"My fianc√©...suddenly, she's my fianc√©.",Marshall
"I deserve this apartment, Marshall.",Ted
No more than I do.,Marshall
"Great, so let's flip for it.",Ted
Flip it.,Marshall
"So, is this how we're deciding who gets the apartment?",Ted
I guess so.,Marshall
How are we doing this exactly? Is this like to the death?,Ted
We should probably figure that out.,Marshall
"It's OK, it's OK.",Ted
Can I observe something?,Ted
That this is kinda awesome?,Marshall
Totally.,Ted
I can't believe we didn't do this before.,Marshall
I know!,Ted
Thank you.,Robin
I can't believe this. I'm sitting here with a beautiful woman I just met eating at my favorite restaurant. Sweet.,Kevin
It's a nice place. It's good to know the future has ribs.,Robin
In the future food will most likely be served in gel-cap form. Plus cows will probably have died out by then... or be our leaders.,Kevin
Just a second.,Robin
Hello.,Robin
"Time's running out, Scherbatsky. Last chance for the lemon law.",Barney
Leave me alone.,Robin
"4:56, 4:57, 4:58.",Barney
We're only just getting to know each other.,Robin
Say I'm right and this could all be over. This could be your call from the hospital.,Barney
Sorry.,Robin
"Let me guess, there's been a crazy accident and you have to go.",Kevin
"No, I would never do that. I don't wanna go anywhere. I'm all yours.",Robin
"Look, if you're a hooker, I don't have a lot of money.",Kevin
That was awesome.,Marshall
I know.,Ted
Do it again.,Marshall
"OK, but this time, jump up and I'll swipe your legs.",Ted
"Look. Here's why I should get the place. You and Lily, you get to be married. What do I get, right? I get to be unmarried, alone, minus two roommates. And on top of that I could be homeless. Does that seem fair?",Ted
"Oh, boo-freakin-hoo.",Marshall
What?,Ted
"Woe is me. I'm not married yet. My ovaries are shrinking. Ted, if you wanted to be married by now you would be but you're not. And you know why? Because you're irrationally picky. You're easily distracted and you're utterly anhedonic.",Marshall
Anhedonic?,Ted
Anhedonic. It means you can't enjoy anything.,Marshall
The hell I can't. I'm enjoying this.,Ted
"I know, this rules.",Marshall
"Hey, I'm sorry I took the swords down.",Marshall
"That's OK, it led to this totally rad sword fight, didn't it?",Ted
Yeah it did.,Marshall
You remember when we first got these swords?,Marshall
It was the day we moved in.,Ted
"Congratulations, Marshall. We live in an apartment with swords on the wall.",Ted
"List of lifelong dreams, you're not half as long. Crap. I'm missing one of the screws for this table",Marshall
"Just use this wood glue, it'll hold.",Ted
Yeah.,Marshall
"Oh God, I'll be right there.",Robin
"Kevin, I'm so sorry. I have to go. My friend's been stabbed with a sword.",Robin
"Hab slosi quch! You have no honor. You know, if you felt this way you could have just been upfront.",Kevin
"No, I swear that was a real call. I just...Oh forget it.",Robin
I stabbed Lily. I stabbed my fianc√©.,Marshall
"Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fianc√©? I'm kidding. Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment. Marshall: But you fought so bravely for it.",Ted
"I wasn't fighting for the apartment. I was fighting for...I don't know...for everything to stay the way it is. But I'm not gonna get that, so, seriously, take the place, it's yours.",Ted
Is she OK?,Robin
They're just patching her up. She's gonna be fine.,Marshall
"So get this, I was on a date with this girl, Jackie.",Barney
"What? You said she's fine. So, anyway, I was on date with this girl, Jackie.",Barney
"Wow, Jackie, you make a really great first impression. I have a feeling that tonight you might end up being Jackie O.",Barney
"Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to lemon law you.",Jackie
"It's out there, it's a thing. The lemon law is a thing. Damn, I should have called it Barney's law.",Barney
But you're totally...,Robin
Just let him have this one.,Ted
All set. She said she'd like to see the knights of the poorly constructed round table?,Doctor
That's us.,Marshall
A sword fight?,Lily
"On Monday, I'm gonna have to tell my kindergarten class who I teach not to run with scissors that my fianc√© ran me through with a frickin' broad sword.",Lily
"Well, just to be fair, it didn't go all the way through.",Marshall
"I'm sorry, is this a discussion of the degree to which you stabbed me?",Lily
You're right. I'm sorry. We were fighting to see who gets the apartment. And I won.,Marshall
"Uh, you didn't win. I gave it to you.",Ted
"Uh, you know, if I tried...",Marshall
"Wait wait wait wait wait. I don't want that apartment. It's a boy apartment. It's full of swords and videogames, and kinda smells like dude. It's fine for now, but when we get married, I wanna start a new life with you in a new place.",Lily
Gonna miss the old place.,Marshall
I will too. We're not getting married for like a year.,Lily
"Yeah, that's Future Marshall's problem. Let that guy deal with it.",Ted
Totally.,Marshall
Maybe it's the massive bl*od loss talking but I'm starving.,Lily
Let's go get some dinner.,Marshall
I know just the place.,Lily
"Chinese restaurant, I still don't believe it.",Ted
"I told you. OK, a toast.",Lily
"Life is full of changes. One day you have an apartment, the next day it's a house of dumplings. But the important stuff doesn't change. To the important stuff.",Lily
Here here. Cheers,Everyone
And to the lemon law.,Barney
Self-clink.,Barney
"And by the way, I bought these glasses. I bought them at Ikea. These are my glasses.",Lily
I love this song. I haven't heard this in forever.,Marshall
I'm pretty sure this is a mixed tape you made me in sophomore year.,Lily
"Lily, your apartment makes the best Shanghai dumplings.",Robin
"Well, I just ralphed.",Lily
How much did you guys drink last night?,Robin
Not how much? What.,Ted
"The Thankstini. A fun and delicious new novelty drink I invented. Cranberry juice, potato vodka and a bouillon cube. Tastes just like a turkey dinner.",Barney
It's like Thanksgiving in my mouth.,Marshall
"You want a good holiday drink, try his Kwanzaapolitan.",Ted
The shuttle's here!,Marshall
He hasn't been back home to Minnesota since Christmas. He's a little excited.,Lily
"Baby, we're holding up the shuttle, do you have everything you need? Toothbrush, pajamas, underpants. Underpants.",Marshall
"So, Lil, Marshall's family. Whole weekend with the future in-laws, you excited?",Ted
"Yeah, no, it'll be fun.",Lily
"Lily, you just said, yeah, no.",Robin
"Did I? No, I, I love Marshall's family.",Lily
"But, yeah, no, it'll be great.",Lily
You just did it again.,Ted
"Yeah, no, shut up.",Lily
"Wait, so you're not going home for Thanksgiving.",Robin
"No, I have to work on Friday. You?",Ted
"I'm Canadian, remember? We celebrate Thanksgiving in October.",Robin
"Oh, right, I forgot you guys are weird. You pronounce the word out, oat",Ted
"You guys are the world's leader in g*n violence, your healthcare system is bankrupt and your country is deeply divided on almost every important issue.",Robin
Your cops are called Mounties.,Ted
"So, probably hanging out with Barney then?",Robin
"No, Barney's got his own Thanksgiving tradition.",Ted
"Thanksgiving in a strip club, who's in? The Lusty Leopard has a surprisingly good Thanksgiving buffet. Plus, they do this thing. Heather dresses up as a pilgrim and Misty dresses up as an Indian, and they share a meal.",Barney
"Oh, Barney.",Lily
"I'm sorry, Native American.",Barney
"I think I'm gonna go to a homeless shelter, serve food.",Ted
That's awesome.,Robin
"Yeah, I thought I'd just spend the day giving back, you know, doing some good.",Ted
Canceling out Barney.,Barney
Exactly.,Ted
Where are all my underpants?,Marshall
Did you check your suitcase?,Lily
Let's go.,Marshall
"Hello, we're home!",Marshall
"Wow, I forgot how tall you guys are.",Lily
Here I am. ,Lily
You're gonna go play hockey?,Lily
With a basketball?,Lily
We invented it. It's the most dangerous and awesome sport in the world.,Marshall
Baskiceball? Not iceketball?,Lily
Yeah.,Ericksens
"It's baskiceball, OK? And I'm the best.",Marcus
You wish.,Marshall
"Oh, well maybe that's just 'cause you haven't seen me play.",Lily
"I don't know honey, it's not really a sport for a girl.",Marshall
"Well, that's funny because your brother throws like a girl.",Lily
This is gonna be great.,Robin
"I know. I'm so psyched we did this. Look at all these people, giving up their Thanksgiving to help their fellow man. These have got to be the best people in New York.",Ted
"Excuse me, guys. Coming through.",Barney
Barney?,Ted
"Well, hi guys.",Barney
What are you doing here?,Ted
"Oh, just the Lord's work.",Barney
But you're Satan.,Ted
"Guys, OK, look, I don't advertise it, but I volunteer here. I think it's important to help the less fortunate. I'm the Angelina Jolie of incredibly hot guys.",Barney
"This is a joke, right? You don't actually volunteer here.",Robin
"Barney, we need you out front. There is a logjam on the stuffing line. Can you show them how it's done?",Kendall
I'm on it.,Barney
"Wait, so, this is real. Barney does this?",Ted
"Every Sunday, all year long. He's our best volunteer",Kendall
"That's because I was trained by the best, Kendall.",Barney
"Anyway, uh, we're psyched to be here, Kendall. What do you need us to do?",Ted
"Go home, we're full.",Kendall
"What? Ted: We're volunteers, we're unpaid help. Can you really ever have enough unpaid help?",Robin
"On the biggest volunteer day of the year, yeah, you can.",Kendall
"Come on, we just wanna help out.",Robin
"Kendall, they're cool.",Barney
"Fine, but I'm not promising anything. Wait here, we'll let you know if we need you.",Kendall
"OK, well, I better get out there. There's a lot of food to give out. And a lot of smiles.",Barney
Thank you. It'll go great with my...I just love it.,Lily
"Oh, I make this great frisee and endive salad with a coriander lime vinaigrette.",Lily
Seven-layer salad?,Lily
Six cups of mayonnaise? That can't be right.,Lily
"Oh my God, there is some serious baskiceball going on out there. Dad totally nailed Marcus in the face with a snowball, which is a foul because you only get one snowball per possession, so I nailed him in the shin with my skate and I totally dunked it.",Marshall
"You having fun? Lily: Yeah, but I kinda miss you. Could you stay in here for a little bit?",Marshall
"Yeah, yeah yeah, no problem, it's halftime.",Marshall
"And I hope you like the taste of stick, dorko.",Marvin
Go.,Lily
Thanks baby.,Marshall
"Oh, isn't this great? Can't you see why everybody from my high school stays in this town?",Marshall
"Hey Marvin, you're the dorko, dorko!",Marshall
"Man, it's amazing out there. I've done so much good today, I've got like a soul boner.",Barney
Yesterday you said the best feeling on earth was getting your toes sucked. Then you requested a high-five with your foot.,Robin
"Hey, Barn? What do you say you let us sub in for you, scoop stuffing for a little bit?",Ted
"You wanna scoop stuffing your first day out? Hello, NFL, can I be quarterback this Sunday? Dude.",Barney
"OK, I finished the gummy bear layer of the salad. What's next?",Lily
Potato chips.,Lily
"Baby? Uh, you know, I hadn't really thought about it at all.",Lily
"Well, I just ralphed.",Lily
"Yeah, I mean, I'm way too young to have a baby, right?",Lily
Oh my.,Lily
"That's a big baby, Judy.",Lily
Twins. Twins!,Lily
This is crazy. When did it get so hard to do charity work?,Ted
I do charity work all the time. Remember when I said I'd find you a girlfriend.,Robin
Ha ha. Delightful. How is that little project coming along anyway?,Ted
I'm working on it. I'm gonna introduce you to that girl you've been staring at.,Robin
"What? That's crazy, I haven't been staring at any girl...",Ted
Have you met Ted?,Robin
"Hi, I'm the aforementioned Ted, and this is...",Ted
... gone.,Ted
I'm Amanda.,Amanda
Hi.,Ted
"So, what do you do here, Ted?",Amanda
"Well, I've been...nothing. I do nothing.",Ted
"If you want to do something, you and your girlfriend can help sort through these donations.",Amanda
"Oh, um, I'm not his girlfriend. I used to be but, um, I just wasn't enough woman for Ted, emotionally or sexually. Oh my God.",Robin
"So, Amanda, what do you need us to do?",Ted
"OK, this is important. Go through all these boxes of food donations, take out the really good stuff and put it into this box.",Amanda
Got it. Consider it sorted.,Ted
"Hey, we're in business.",Robin
"Hey, Barney's not gonna get all the glory today.",Ted
Let's start with this one.,Ted
Yeah.,Robin
Amen.,Ericksens
Three months! Three months?,Lily
He's been drinking his milk.,Marshall
Here here.,Ericksens
And she's already pregnant again.,Lily
"Dad, you're embarrassing me.",Marshall
"Yeah, well, well, not literally because, you know, I'm keeping my name.",Lily
"Well, we haven't actually decided anything yet so...",Marshall
"No, I've decided and I'm keeping my own name.",Lily
"Oh, sure, in St. Cloud but our kids aren't gonna be growing up in St. Cloud. Right, baby?",Lily
"Why not St. Cloud? I mean, I loved growing up St. Cloud. St. Cloud is a great place to have a childhood.",Marshall
"Oh, so is New York.",Lily
What? It is. And we grew up just fine. And we grew to the proper size and then we stopped.,Lily
"Hey, Amanda, what's this box for?",Ted
"Oh, that's for me. You can put it in my car.",Amanda
"In your car, um, then you'll take it...",Ted
"Home? We get so much extra food, no one can eat it all. Oh, Truffle oil. Score.",Amanda
People donated this food thinking it was going to feed the hungry.,Ted
"I know, and I'm starving.",Amanda
"But, Marshall, you love New York.",Lily
"Yes, I do. But you always said that when we had kids, you wanted to move out of Manhattan.",Marshall
"Yeah, to Brooklyn.",Lily
Why are we even talking about this? This is way down the road.,Marshall
I need to go to the restroom.,Lily
"Lily, the restroom's the other way.",Marshall
Lily.,Marshall
Lily!,Marshall
"So, wait, not only have you not done any good for anyone today, you're actually helping someone steal from the homeless. You know, Ted, it's called Thanksgiving, not Thankstaking. Damn.",Barney
"Barney, you need me to sign your time sheet, right?",Kendall
"Yeah, Right. Thanks.",Barney
Barney.,Ted
"Yeah, what's up?",Barney
You have a time sheet. No one else has a time sheet.,Ted
"Yeah, so.",Barney
"All right, let me see that.",Ted
That's my private personal business!,Barney
Court-mandated community service.,Ted
That's my private personal business.,Barney
I was unfairly punished because the wall belonged to the judge's church.,Barney
You peed on a church?,Ted
I peed in an alley which happened to have a church which I did not see because I was drunk.,Barney
"Oh, you are evil.",Ted
"Now, all's right with the world again.",Robin
"OK, fine, so a judge is making me do this but I'm still doing it, and kicking ass at it, BTW.",Barney
When's the last time either of you did any good? Huh?,Barney
"Kendall, ah, Kendall, Amanda is stealing Portobello mushrooms from homeless people.",Ted
Amanda! I called dibs on the Portobello mushrooms.,Kendall
Those are for the hungry.,Ted
"I know, and I'm starving.",Kendall
Those are good mushrooms!,Amanda
Mushrooms. Mushrooms. Portobello mushrooms for everybody! Take them and run! They're very expensive!,Ted
Happy Thanksgiving.,Clerk
"Happy Thanksgiving. As in check out the chick buying the knock-up test everybody, wonder what must be going through her head. Yeah, well, since you asked, a family of mayonnaise-guzzling giants is trying to suck me into their suburban nightmare. And there's a solid chance that I have an Ericksen the size of a 15-pound turkey growing inside of me.",Lily
You know the Ericksen's? Marshall's fianc√©.,Clerk
Fantastic.,Lily
So nice to meet you. You are taller than described.,Clerk
I'm sorry I just yelled at you. You mind if I use your bathroom?,Lily
Don't have one.,Clerk
So what do you do when you have to...?,Lily
I hold it.,Clerk
You can't fire a volunteer.,Ted
Apparently you can. And his two non-mushroom-throwing friends.,Robin
I can't believe that I told Kendall you guys were cool. I had 40 hours left on my community service and now I've got to spend it spearing trash on a freaking median strip.,Barney
Volunteer of the year!,Barney
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, look, if there's anything I can do to make it up to you, just tell me, I'll do it.",Ted
"Ted, I'm glad you asked.",Barney
Surprisingly good.,Robin
Right? I told you so.,Barney
Public urination. Who gets arrested for public urination?,Ted
Lily's been arrested.,Marshall
"Oh dear, what for? Marshall: Public urination.",Judy
"Thanks, Pete.",Marshall
No problemo Marsh.,Pete
You all right? Lily: No. I embarrassed myself in front of your family and now I'm celebrating Thanksgiving in probably the most depressing place ever.,Marshall
"Well, I'm glad that you're safe. Hey, weird question, why did you drive three miles down Route 23 and take a pee behind a convenience store?",Marshall
"OK, I'll tell you but before I do, promise me that we are not gonna move to St. Cloud, Minnesota, promise.",Lily
"Look, I'm not suggesting that we move here tomorrow. I'm just...",Marshall
Just promise.,Lily
Why do you want me to promise you that?,Marshall
Because I don't fit in here. I'm not eight feet tall and I don't think you can call it a salad if it has Funyuns in it.,Lily
"I'm Funyuns and mayonnaise and gummy bears and baskiceball and I love St. Cloud. And yes, there is a part of me that would like to move here someday, and why are we having this discussion in a jail cell on Thanksgiving?",Marshall
"OK, personal effects, one wallet, one cell phone, one pregnancy test.",Pete
Pete arrested me before I could look at it.,Lily
Whoa.,Marshall
Yeah.,Lily
"Lily, we can't let our kids play baskiceball. Baskiceball is really dangerous.",Marshall
"Yeah, what are the rules to that game, anyway? Marshall: There are no rules, we just wail on each other.",Lily
"Look, I don't wanna be exactly like my family, and don't take this the wrong way, but I don't wanna be exactly like your family either.",Marshall
"Great, now I'm crying. Look, we may have some really big decisions to make in about 10 seconds but right now, I don't care where our kids grow up as long as they have you for a father.",Lily
"Gosh, I hope you're the father. Just a little joke to lighten up the mood.",Lily
What does it say? Lily: I'm afraid to look.,Marshall
It's negative.,Pete
Thank God.,Lily
And hey!,Lily
Ted. Are you listening? You're a good guy.,Robin
"You wanna know why I have to work tomorrow? My firm's designing an executive lounge for a tobacco company. In the fight against cancer, I'm on the side of cancer.",Ted
"OK, Ted, I found a way for you to help someone, to do some good. This is Walter, and Walter is homeless. And Walter would like a lap dance.",Barney
Are you joking?,Ted
I never joke about the sublime art of burlesque entertainment.,Barney
"No, Barney, that's insane. Sir, would you like me to buy you a ticket to the buffet.",Ted
"No, I'm stuffed. Just a lap dance would be fine.",Walter
"Ted, Walter's been to three shelter dinners. You know where he hasn't been? To heaven with Samantha. Look, it's the one chance you've had all day to help someone in need. Now buy this man a lap dance.",Barney
You said you wanted to see the joy in someone's eyes.,Robin
"You know, I don't think I'm gonna watch.",Ted
"Here you go, Walter. Happy Thanksgiving.",Ted
"Thank you so much. No really, thank you.",Walter
"Happy Thanksgiving, guys.",Ted
Thanksgiving in November. Weird.,Robin
"Hey, I saw what you did for that guy? It was really sweet. Do you wanna dance?",Dancer
"Uh, no thanks. You want some yams?",Ted
No thanks. I'm Amber.,Dancer
I'm Ted.,Ted
"Actually, I'm Tracy.",Dancer
Still Ted.,Ted
On the house.,Carl
Whoa.,Everyone
It's my own concoction. I call it the Red Dragon.,Carl
"Wow. Thanks, Carl.",Everyone
"We're not really doing shots, are we?",Ted
I hope not.,Lily
"No, no.",Barney
These look kinda like bl*od.,Lily
"OK, I know that you've all dismissed this theory before, but is there any chance that Carl is a vampire?",Marshall
That's ridiculous.,Barney
"I'm serious. Think about it. He always wears black, we never see him in the daylight, only after dark.",Marshall
"Oh my God, that does describe a vampire, or you know, a bartender.",Robin
"Well, I should go get dressed.",Robin
"Where are you going, buddy? Hot date?",Ted
"I'll say, she's going out with a billionaire.",Lily
"Lily, I told you not to call him that.",Robin
"Wait, you're really going out with a billionaire?",Ted
He's not a billionaire. He's a hundred millionaire. Why do people always round up?,Robin
"So, uh, where's Thurston Howell taking you?",Ted
A charity dinner.,Robin
"Yeah, $2000 a plate.",Lily
"$1500, Stop rounding up. And it's for third world hunger.",Robin
You gonna put out?,Barney
What? There's only one reason he's taking her to this dinner and it's not so little Mutu can get his malaria pills.,Barney
I think my soul just threw up a little bit.,Lily
"Well, I'm gonna be late. You guys have fun. Bye.",Robin
See ya.,Ted
Bye.,Lily
You OK?,Marshall
"Sure, why?",Ted
I don't know. Girl of your dreams dating a billionaire.,Marshall
"OK, first of all, hundred millionaire. And second, she's not the girl of my dreams. We're just friend. Look, it would not be smart if we got together. I mean, I'm looking to settle down. She's looking for...",Ted
What? You done? Great. Check out table number four. See that little hottie on the end. She's short but has an ample bosom. I love it. She's like half-boob. Let's go.,Barney
"Yeah, and say what? What's our big opening line?",Ted
Daddy's home.,Barney
Daddy's home?,Ted
Yeah.,Barney
"You want us to go over there right now and say to those girls, 'daddy's home.' Really think about that, Barney.",Ted
"Hm. Yeah, I think it's pretty solid.",Barney
"OK, think about this, is there even a single item on the menu that has garlic in it?",Marshall
Garlic fries.,Lily
"OK, well, I'll get back to you.",Marshall
"Oh, daddy's back. See, if you'd taken a moment to think about that...",Ted
"Then Daddy wouldn't have gotten this seven-digit Father's Day card from Amy, huh?",Barney
That worked. I hate the world.,Ted
"Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think. I'm teaching you how to do, do, do.",Barney
Doo-doo.,Marshall
Totally.,Barney
"So, I think a lot. I happen to have a very powerful brain. It can't be helped.",Ted
Oh yes it can.,Barney
Interesting,Marshall
"Ted, I believe you and I met for a reason. It's like the universe was saying, hey, Barney, there's this dude, he's pretty cool but it's your job to make him awesome. Your brain screws you up, Ted. It gets in the way. It happened with Robin, it happened with half-boob. And it's gonna keep on happening until you power down that bucket of neuroses inebriation-style.",Barney
"So, what? You want me to do a sh*t.",Ted
Oh no. I want you to do five shots.,Barney
"Oooh, more interesting.",Marshall
"Barney, I think you've officially...",Ted
"No, don't think. Do.",Barney
"Ted, he's right. You overthink. Maybe you should overdrink.",Marshall
"Ah, Lily, will you tell these guys how stupid they're being?",Ted
"Guys, you are being immature and moronic and drink, drink, drink",Lily
"Let me tell you something about this brain, OK?",Ted
Even alcohol cannot stop this brain.,Ted
"I love it, I love it, I love it.",Barney
"This brain, dear mortals, is no ordinary brain.",Ted
This is a superbrain.,Ted
This brain is unstoppable. This brain...,Ted
"OK, what the hell happened last night?",Ted
"You really don't remember, Superbrain?",Marshall
And how did you guys like the shots?,Carl
"I drank all five, bitch.",Ted
I love drunk Ted.,Marshall
Marshall thinks you're a vampire.,Ted
"If he pukes, one of you guys cleans it up.",Carl
No dibs. ,Lily
Oh. ,Marshall
No....Dammit.,Barney
How quickly you all forget. I haven't puked since high school. I am vomit-free since ninety-three. Vomit free since ninety-three. That's funny. I'm funny.,Ted
Who are you calling?,Lily
Robin.,Ted
"Oh, bad idea.",Marshall
"No, no, that's a great idea. That's the whole point of getting drunk. You do things you would never do in a million years if you were sober.",Barney
Says every girl you've ever slept with.,Lily
Say what?!,Marshall
"Hello Robin, it's Ted.",Ted
Oh hi Ted.,Robin
"Hello Robin, it's Ted.",Ted
Hi Ted. Sounds like you're having fun.,Robin
"Robin, have I ever told you that I'm vomit-free since ninety-three?",Ted
"Listen, Ted, I can't really talk right... '93? Dude, that's impressive.",Robin
"I don't say this enough, but you're a great woman, and a great reporter. You should be on 60 Minutes. You should be one of the minutes.",Ted
That's sweet and odd. But I'm kinda on a date right now.,Robin
"Yeah, and I disagree with Barney. Just 'cause this guy is spending a lot of money doesn't mean you have to put out. Take it slow, Robin, take it slow. Slow.",Ted
Bye Ted.,Robin
Slow.,Ted
"Wow, right, that's why we don't do shots.",Marshall
Friends don't let friends drink and dial.,Lily
I need that phone back.,Ted
You'll get this back at the end of class.,Lily
"Ding, class dismissed. Here you go, kid, you call whoever you want.",Barney
Thank you kind sir. At least someone appreciates the fact that I'm doing and not thinking. And now I don't think I won't not go to the bathroom.,Ted
"Was that necessary? He is not making smart decisions. Barney: Exactly. It's like, what's he gonna do next. I don't know, but I want to find out.",Lily
Cheap Trick? Oh Ted.,Marshall
"Hello again, Ted.",Robin
"Hey, it's me again.",Ted
Plain to see again.,Ted
Please can I see you every day?,Ted
I love everyone in this bar.,Ted
"And we love you, drunk Ted.",Marshall
I'm a fool again.,Ted
I fell in love...,Ted
Ted?,Robin
"Well, that explains the ankle.",Ted
And then we brought you home and put you to bed.,Lily
Was there anyone else in there with me?,Ted
There's a girl in there.,Lily
I know.,Ted
And a pineapple.,Marshall
I know.,Ted
Who is she?,Lily
I don't know.,Ted
What the hell happened to my jacket? Marshall: Whoa.,Ted
"That girl in there is alive, right? Ted: I should call Barney, maybe he knows what happened.",Lily
Hello.,Barney
Why are you sleeping in our tub?,Ted
The porcelain keeps the suit from wrinkling.,Barney
"Wait, were you here when I went to the bathroom in the middle of the night?",Lily
"Don't worry, I slept through it.  I totally didn't sleep through it. For a little girl, you've got a big t*nk.",Barney
How did you get in here anyway? We put Ted to bed around one.,Marshall
"Oh, you put Ted to bed all right.",Barney
You guys take care of me. You guys are the best. I love you guys so much.,Ted
"Good night, Ted.",Lily
"Love you too, buddy.",Marshall
I'm back baby doll!,Ted
"Hey, hey hey hey, he rallies. And the night begins now.",Barney
"All right, game face on. Carl, two more. All right, all right, what do we think of this one?",Barney
I think....,Ted
"Ehhh! Trick question, no thinking. You know what time it is? It's do o'clock. Let's ride.",Barney
Bring it.,Ted
Have you met Ted?,Barney
You're calling Robin.,Barney
I'm calling Robin.,Ted
"Ted, as your mentor and spiritual guide, I forbid you from calling her.",Barney
Oh yeah? What you gonna do?,Ted
"If you complete that call, I will set your coat on fire.",Barney
You're bluffing.,Ted
"Hello, Robin, it's Ted.",Ted
"Ted, for the last time, stop.",Robin
Ted!,Robin
You set me on fire.,Ted
"Real suede wouldn't have gone up so fast. You got robbed, this is a blend.",Barney
You set me on fire. And who's the girl in my bed?,Ted
And a pineapple. Am I the only one who's curious about the pineapple?,Marshall
Who is she?,Barney
I have no idea.,Ted
Nice.,Barney
You really don't know who that is?,Ted
"No, after I hosed you down with a beverage g*n, I brought you back here.",Barney
I better not have gotten b*rned.,Ted
Did any of you write that?,Ted
"Hi, I'm Ted, if lost, please call...Who's number is that?",Lily
I don't know.,Ted
"Dude, call it. Hold on, I'm gonna make some popcorn.",Marshall
"OK, you can call now. God, this is intense, I love it.",Marshall
Hello.,Guy
"Uh, hi, who is this?",Ted
"You called me, who's this?",Guy
It's Ted.,Ted
"It's Carl, from the bar.",Carl
"Barney, you've always taken care of me. You are a gentleman and a scholar. Go into my stable and take my finest stallion. He's yours, his name is Windjammer.",Ted
"Sleep it off, bra.",Barney
"I'm back, baby doll! Ted: And I am gonna throw up.",Ted
"I threw up? My streak is over. Vomit-free since '05 doesn't sound good. Sorry, Carl, go on.",Ted
"Carl, did you know the word karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra? Isn't that hauntingly beautiful? Are you a vampire? Carl: I am cutting you off. Go home and get some sleep, Ted.",Ted
"Yeah, sun's gonna come up soon. Wouldn't want to be around for that, would we?",Ted
"Hey, how easy do you think it'll be to sneak into the zoo? I have to see some penguins, like right now.",Ted
Give me your arm.,Carl
"This way, if you pass out in the gutter...",Carl
That tickles.,Ted
Someone will call me and I will come get you.,Carl
"Thanks Carl. We can't just be friends, we're attracted to each other and we both know it.",Ted
Excuse me?,Carl
"Me and Robin. Me and Robin, I have to make one more call.",Ted
"Yeah, this'll go good.",Carl
"Hey, it's me again. Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life, so shy don't you come over to my apartment and we'll think of something stupid to do together? Really? Great. Wait, really? Great.",Ted
Thanks Carl.,Ted
It's Robin. That's Robin in there.,Ted
Did you guys?,Marshall
"Oh come on. You've gotta give me this one. Those five shots got you farther with Robin than your brain ever did. See what happens when you don't think? You do! More importantly, you do Robin. Come on.",Barney
"All right, right over here.",Lily
"Still, what does this mean? Are we dating now? I mean, I never pictured it going down this way, but maybe that's how it had to happen. I mean, think about it...",Ted
"Someone get him a sh*t, he's thinking again.",Barney
"Maybe it's not such a bad idea to think about this one. You and Robin went down this road before, you got dinged up pretty bad.",Marshall
You know who might have something to say about Ted's future with Robin? Robin. Go wake her up.,Lily
Wake her up and say what?,Ted
Daddy's home.,Barney
Good luck buddy.,Marshall
Hello.,Ted
"Ted, it's Robin.",Robin
Are you sure?,Ted
"Hey, Robin, how are you?",Ted
"Ted, I think you and I should have a talk about those phone calls last night. Do you mind if I swing by?",Robin
Ask her about the pineapple.,Marshall
"Yeah, sure, come on over.",Ted
Thanks.,Robin
"No, wait, don't, no.",Ted
She's coming over. Crap.,Ted
"Wait, this is k*ll me. We have to find out who that girl is.",Lily
Trudy. My name is Trudy.,Trudy
"I know, it's two years of my life I'm never getting back. A little part of me just wants to jump the bones of the next guy I see.",Trudy
Daddy's home.,Barney
Or the one after that.,Trudy
"OK, fair enough. I've got to prove a point to a friend, so you just gave me your number and your name is Amy.",Barney
Ladies.,Barney
I love everyone in this bar.,Ted
He's kinda cute.,Trudy
"What are you doing in the men's room? What am I doing in the ladies' room? Oh right, I came in here 'cause I thought I was gonna throw up.",Ted
Did you?,Trudy
I did not.,Ted
And the streak continues. Vomit-free since '93.,Ted
"Sorry, Trudy, go on.",Ted
I liked your performance.,Trudy
What? The karaoke? Domo arigato.,Ted
"I wish I had your guts, getting up and making a complete idiot of myself.",Trudy
Do it.,Ted
"I don't know. Still, I've had a pretty serious week. I could sure stand to do something stupid.",Trudy
"I'm something stupid, do me.",Ted
You're funny.,Trudy
"Hey, can I call you sometime? Trudy: OK.",Ted
Why do they call it karaoke anyhow? Was it invented by a woman named Carrie Okie? These are the kinds of things I think about. Trudy: Karaoke is Japanese for empty orchestra.,Ted
That's hauntingly beautiful.,Ted
"Hey, it works.",Ted
Then I guess you're gonna have to call me.,Trudy
I need to make one more call.,Ted
Hello.,Trudy
"Hey, it's me again.",Ted
Hey.,Trudy
"Look, who are we kidding? You and I are both attracted to each other. We're young, we're drunk, half of us anyway. And we only get one life.",Ted
"So I came over here. And now I'm really, really embarrassed.",Trudy
"Dammit, Trudy, what about the pineapple? Sorry.",Marshall
"Uh, Robin's here. Um, look, Trudy, I need you to hide in my bedroom.",Ted
"Why, is that your girlfriend?",Trudy
"No, that's not my girlfriend. Look, it's complicated.",Ted
"You're married. Yeah, I can't believe I did this.",Trudy
"No, I'm not married. Um, I'll explain after you hide.",Ted
Hi.,Ted
Hey guys.,Robin
Robin.,Barney
Hi Robin.,Lily
Top of the morning.,Barney
"Um, sorry I kept calling you like that. I was very drunk.",Ted
"No kidding. Those calls were really weird. Look, Ted, maybe we need to talk.",Robin
Let's go get a snack.,Lily
I love to snack.,Marshall
I'm good.,Barney
"Come on, those calls weren't that weird.",Ted
"Robin! Come hang out! OK, I'm gonna make this sound until you come hang out.",Ted
That goes on for three-and a half minutes.,Robin
Without a breath? That's gotta be some kind of record.,Ted
"Ted, you can't do this. Please, we're to be friends and now you're making it all confusing.",Robin
"No I'm not. Look, I just turned off my brain for the night. Nothing's changed, you've moved on, I've moved on.",Ted
"Really, you moved on?",Robin
"Yes. What, you don't believe me?",Ted
"Oh, OK.",Ted
"Trudy, come on out.",Ted
"Wait, you were with someone last night? Ted: Yeah, Trudy, she's cool.",Robin
"Trudy, come on out.",Ted
"Seriously, it's OK. This is so Trudy. She's really shy, I think.",Ted
Trudy?,Ted
"Hi Trudy, I'm Robin. It's nice to meet you. You're right, she is shy.",Robin
I'm not making this up. She must have climbed out the fire escape.,Ted
"Whatever, whatever. I don't care what you think.",Ted
"Then why did you hide her from me? Ted: Wow, you're good. Did anyone ever tell you you should be on 60 Minutes?",Robin
"Yes, you did, last night.",Robin
Really? Well.,Ted
"Get some sleep, Ted. You had a long night. And don't feel bad, I've woken up with worse.",Robin
"Yeah, that's right...a limo.",Ted
"Oh, man, Ted, this is great.",Robin
"Okay, people, let's talk strategy. Last new years, we went our separate ways, and it sucked. This year we party together or not at all. Now, I sifted through your party submission and I narrowed them down to these five.",Ted
Question?,Barney
"Yes, Barney, your submissions were received and no, we will not be attending any parties in your pants.",Ted
"But you enjoyed the e-vite, right? Thas an actual picture of my pants.",Barney
Yeah.,Lily
"We will hit all five parties before midnight, and then narrow them down to one, the most awesome party in New York City and that is where we will ring, nay rock, in the new year.",Ted
"All right, and party number one that's where we get to meet Mary Beth?",Lily
Mary Beth?,Robin
"Oh, she works in my office. She seems like she might be into me. She's always finding reasons to hug me. So tonight...",Ted
"People often ask me Barney, how is it that you're so psyched so much of the time?",Barney
By who? Who asks you that?,Lily
"And the answer is right here... my own, personal get psyched mix. Now, people often think a good mix should rise and fall, but people are wrong. It should be all rise, baby. Now prepare yourselves for an audio journey into the white-hot center of adrenaline. Bam.",Barney
It's working.,Lily
I am definitely getting psyched.,Ted
"Oh, God. I'm reaching dangerous levels of psychage. Must do robot.",Marshall
Let's do this!,Barney
"Yes! Let's! Oh, driver?",Ted
"Ranjit! Dude, you're driving a limo now. That's awesome.",Barney
I've moved up in the world.,Ranjit
How do you guys know each other?,Robin
"Oh, we rode in his cab one time. It's a long story.",Ted
"Hey, what are we waiting for? We got five parties to hit, and three hours to do it.",Barney
"Oh, I wish I could come with you guys but Derek should be coming by any minute to pick me up.",Robin
"Oh, I'll miss you guys. Have fun.",Robin
Bye.,Lily
See ya next year. Go get 'em.,Ted
"Well, this kind of sucks.",Lily
"Okay, nobody get down. We knew this going in. We're a man down. That just means we're gonna have to party that much harder. Ranjit! Party number one.",Ted
Party number one!,Ranjit
Party number one!,Barney
"I can't believe we're leaving a party that had pigs in blankets. If you think we can b*at that, you got some brass ones.",Marshall
"Hey, we've got four more parties to hit. If party number one turns out to be the best, we'll just limo on back to it.",Ted
"We didn't really get a chance to meet. I'm Lily, and this is my fiance, Marshall.",Lily
My word.,Marshall
"You're, you're friendly.",Lily
"Oh, no.",Lily
"So, Barney, who's your new friend?",Ted
Natalya.,Barney
"Oh, friendly.",Natalya
"So, where are you from, Natalya?",Lily
She... Who knows? The former Soviet Republic of Drunk-Off-Her-Ass-Istan?,Barney
"Super-drunk-fantastic, huh?",Natalya
Isn't she awesome?,Barney
"How are your feet doing, baby?",Marshall
"Okay, I love these shoes, but the pain-to-hotness ratio is pretty steep. Can we swing by the apartment, so I can change?",Lily
"Come on, Lily, we have a tightly scheduled evening of awesomeness ahead of us. I need you to power through the pain.",Ted
"Okay, Ted, but these dogs are really barking.",Lily
"It's true. I can hear them. What's that, little boys? What's that? You wanna go for a... rock?",Barney
Ranjit! Party number two.,Ted
Party number two.,Ranjit
Party number two? Not so good.,Ted
Let's go back to party number one.,Marshall
"No, no turning back. Ranjit, party number three.",Ted
Party number three. Yeah.,Ranjit
"Oh, wait, wait, wait. We have to turn around. We left Natalya.",Barney
"Barney, none of us really liked her.",Lily
What?!,Barney
Sorry.,Lily
"Oh, very nice, Lily. You know, she is a guest in this country. So while you may chose to turn your back on her, I choose to turn my front on her. What up?",Barney
I'm sorry about Barney.,Ted
"Me, too. (",Ted
"Ted, Derek stood me up.",Robin
"Ranjit, turn it around.",Ted
"Oh, God, I'm so sorry about this. You guys had your schedule and I screwed it all up.",Robin
"No, this is perfect. It's meant to be. We're all back together.",Ted
What happened?,Lily
Derek's stuck in Connecticut closing some deal. Who works on New Year's Eve? Okay. Now I feel worse. I was really looking forward to this night. This sucks.,Robin
"Oh, dude, not now!",Marshall
What? She needs to get psyched. Fine.,Barney
Maybe I should just go home.,Robin
My finger slipped.,Barney
"Look, Robin, you're not going home. Come on, it's New Year's Eve. Look, so your date fell through. So what? What do you need a date for? Someone to kiss at midnight? Fine. I'll kiss you at... a little bit after midnight.",Ted
"Hi, I'm Robin.",Robin
You're friendly. I haven't eaten dinner yet. Is there anything to eat in this thing?,Robin
"That's it. I know what you're jonesing for. Ranjit, take us to Gray's Papaya!",Ted
"Oh, yes. Ted, you rock.",Robin
"We couldn't go back for Natalya, a human being, but we do have time for hot dogs?",Barney
"Yeah, we like hot dogs.",Marshall
"No. No. We are already behind schedule. Ted, come on. We have an hour and a half before midnight I don't want to be kissing Ranjit.",Barney
You don't know what you're missing.,Ranjit
"Come on, it's only a 20-minute detour.",Ted
"Which is exactly how much time I need. Ranjit, stop the car.",Lily
Stopping the car.,Ranjit
"Wait. Baby, what are you doing?",Marshall
I'm going home.,Lily
What? No!,Ted
"I can't stay in these heels any longer, I just can't. There's a cab over there. I'll just run back to the apartment and change shoes.",Lily
But... hot dogs.,Marshall
"Well, I know, baby, I'd love to go, but it's two against one.",Lily
"Okay, I'll go with you.",Marshall
"No, baby. Baby, you go with them and I'll meet you at, at... party number three.",Lily
Are you sure?,Marshall
"If I don't see you, happy new year.",Lily
Don't say that. We'll find each other. We'll find each other.,Marshall
I know we will. ,Lily
Hell of a woman. Let's go get some hot dogs!,Marshall
"Ranjit, party number three.",Ted
Party number three.,Ranjit
"Oh, yeah! Look at us. Riding around in a limo. Eating hot dogs. It's like we're the president.",Marshall
Hey. I'll bet you're feeling better now.,Ted
"Oh, so much better.",Robin
Guys. Is that Moby? I think that that's Moby.,Marshall
No way.,Ted
That's totally Moby. That's awesome.,Robin
"Should I say something? I should say something, right? Moby! Hey, Moby!",Ted
"Oh, my God. He's coming over. Everybody be cool. Everybody be cool.",Barney
Hey.,Ted
Hello.,Moby
"What's up? Uh, you, uh, going somewhere?",Ted
"Yeah, I'm just going to this party downtown.",Moby
You want a ride?,Ted
Sure.,Moby
Welcome.,Ted
Wow. You're friendly.,Moby
"Big fan. Barney Stinson. So, uh... what about this party?",Barney
"It's just a New Year's thing. You know, with some friends.",Moby
"Wow, that sounds awesome.",Robin
You guys want to come?,Moby
"Yeah, we'd love to.",Ted
All right.,Moby
"Uh, Ted. Sidebar?",Marshall
"Um... Moby, switch up, will you? Yeah, what's up?",Ted
What about Lily?,Marshall
Call her.,Ted
I've been trying to call her. I can't get through. All the circuits are jammed.,Marshall
"That's New Year's Eve for you. Well, look, we'll just swing by Moby's party and then afterwards...",Ted
"No, I-I can't. Lily's waiting. I gotta... I gotta find her. Okay, I'll meet you at party number three.",Marshall
But... Come on! Moby's party! Moby's party! Moby's par... Ranjit. Moby's party.,Ted
Moby's party.,Ranjit
"This is a cool mix. You know, people think a great mix has to rise and fall. I think it should be all rise.",Moby
"Yes. Moby... Yeah, it should start high, get higher. This mix is my pride and joy. I never leave home without it.",Barney
"Oh, that's how I feel about Janice here.",Moby
Jan... Aah!,Barney
"So then I say, your motorcycle was like that when I got here.",Moby
"You're not Moby, are you?",Ted
Who?,Moby
"Moby... the recording artist, Moby.",Robin
No.,Moby
"But when we said, Hey, Moby, you said, Yeah.",Barney
I thought you said Tony.,Not-moby
So your name is Tony?,Ted
"No. Oh, hey, we're here. All right. You guys going to come in?",Not-moby
Nah.,Ted
You're sure? Come on. It's going to get nuts in there. There's this dude who owes me money.,Not-moby
"No, uh, we're good. We're good. Happy New Year, Not Moby.",Barney
"Oh, hey, hey, um, be safe.",Not-moby
Why did we think that guy was Moby?,Barney
"I don't know. I see a short bald hipster, my mind goes straight to Moby.",Ted
That's Marshall's phone. Hello.,Barney
"Oh, Marshall, thank God I got through.",Lily
"Hey, sexy.",Barney
"Barney, where's Marshall?",Lily
He left his phone in the limo. He's out looking for you.,Barney
What? Where?,Lily
Party number three.,Barney
"Well, I'm here at party number three and... Oh, my God! Guess who just walked in... Moby!",Lily
Moby?! She's upstairs.,Barney
"Lily, you have to get out of there this instant. That's not Moby.",Ted
"Uh, no, I know Moby and that's Mo... Does he have a g*n?",Lily
"Run! Oh, my God, Not Moby's party is party number four. What are the odds?",Ted
Who was that guy?!,Lily
"Well, we know it's not Moby and it's not Tony.",Barney
"Ranjit, drive!",Ted
Where to?,Ranjit
Party number three!,Ted
Party number three!,Ranjit
"No, but I was just at party number three.",Lily
"No, no, no, no you were at party number four. You must have looked at the list wrong.",Ted
"Well, after that rather unpsyching experience, you know what it's time for? It's time to... what? That's right, re-psych. Re-psy... Where's the...? Oh, my God! Not Moby took my Get Psyched mix!",Barney
"Barney, Barney, Barney, it's not worth it! Let it go. We need to get back on schedule.",Ted
"Ah, nuts.",Ranjit
"Ranjit, are you sure I can't help?",Ted
"No. I am pissed. Ted, I don't want you to see me pissed.",Ranjit
"Okay Okay, not a problem. He'll jack it up, slap on a tire and we'll be at party number three in no time.",Ted
I wish Marshall would call. I guess the circuits are jammed.,Lily
"Yeah, you know why all the circuits are jammed because everyone's calling their loved ones, everyone around the world. Everyone except Barney. Oh, sure, laugh. Laugh for Barney Stinson. Laugh for the sad clown trapped on his whirling carousel of suits and cigars and bimbos and booze. Round and round it goes. And where's it all heading? Nowhere.",Barney
Is this just 'cause you lost your Get Psyched mix?,Robin
I'm sorry. Am I not allowed to have a pensive side?,Barney
"No. No, not tonight. Not in the limo. We got to stay psyched. Ted went to a lot of trouble to make this an awesome New Year's. (",Robin
*A bad name*,Ranjit
It'll be fine. We'll be out of here in a jiff.,Ted
"No. Look, I know this night isn't turning out the way I planned, but...",Ted
I'm not in love... We're just friends. Where are you getting that from?,Ted
That's ridiculous. Wait. Really?,Ted
I can't believe Mary Beth left before midnight.,Lily
"Oh, she just had to make an appearance at this other party. It's no big deal.",Ted
"The first time I rode in a limo I was five. I was on the way to my grandfather's funeral. I suppose, in a way, I still am.",Barney
"Okay, wow, it's getting weird in here. I'm going to call Marshall.",Lily
But he left his phone.,Ted
Marshall! Marshall!,Lily
I'm sorry about your girl.,Robin
Sorry about your guy.,Ted
"Well, at least we both have someone to kiss at midnight. Did you forget about our little deal? Because I did not.",Robin
"I did not, too.",Ted
Derek. Hi. How's work?,Robin
I'll give you some privacy.,Ted
Marshall!,Lily
"Okay, how's this for a plan? We start walking now, we get to party number three by 12:45. We celebrate the New Year in Central Standard Time.",Ted
Marshall!,Lily
"Give it a rest, Ted.",Barney
Give what a rest?,Ted
"Trying to turn this night into anything more than what it is, which is New Year's Eve which is the single biggest letdown of a night every single year.",Barney
Marshall!,Lily
"Come on, come on, we can still turn this thing around. We've still got ten minutes.",Ted
"Stop trying to chase down some magical, perfect New Years, Ted. It doesn't exist.",Barney
Marshall!,Lily
Lily!,Marshall
Holy crap.,Ted
Marshall!,Lily
I knew I'd catch up with you guys eventually. So much to tell. I couldn't find Lily at party number three so I walked... I walked to the next party on the list.,Marshall
Not Moby's party?,Ted
"Yes, Moby's party. Check it out. He signed my shirt. And guess what I found. Yeah, I heard it playing at the party, so I swiped it. Yeah, I know. Come on.",Marshall
Come on! Oh! Oh!,Barney
"Baby, baby, I was so worried about you. Why didn't you call me?",Lily
"I tried, baby. All the circuits were jammed. But wait, there's more. After party number four, I figured you guys went to party number five. And so I went there, too, and it is awesome. I want to cry, it is so awesome. We have to go there.",Marshall
How? We'll never get a cab.,Ted
The flat's fixed.,Ranjit
"Let's do this! Come on! In! Go, go, go!",Ted
Natalya?,Lily
"Yeah, it turns out she was asleep in the front seat the whole time. Ranjit, why didn't you tell me?",Barney
I didn't want to awake her. She looked so peaceful.,Ranjit
"Party number five is 20 blocks away and all the way across town. Ranjit, can you get us there in eight minutes?",Ted
I get you there in six.,Ranjit
I don't think I can do it.,Ranjit
No! Come on!,All
"Move, you stupid taxi!",Lily
Three minutes!,Marshall
Come on!,All
"Ranjit, put her in park. Dudes, I'm sure party number five is awesome, but it's not the best party in New York. 'Cause this is, right here.",Ted
Cheers. Well said.,Barney
Cheers.,All
Derek?! Derek.,Robin
Hey.,Derek
"Hey, uh, come on in.",Ted
I cut my meeting short because I wanted to see you at midnight.,Derek
I can't believe you made it.,Robin
"I made it, baby.",Derek
"I super love you, okay?",Natalia
"Here, you need a mint.",Barney
"Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Happy New Year!",All
"What the hell, man? I thought we had a deal.",Robin
What about your guy? It's midnight. Go kiss him.,Ted
"Eh, he kept me waiting. I can keep him waiting.",Robin
"Well, a deal is a deal.",Ted
Happy New Year.,Robin
Happy New Year.,Ted
Who the hell am I gonna bring to this wedding?,Ted
"Ted, have you ignored all my teachings? Ted: For the most part, yeah.",Barney
"You don't bring a date to a wedding. That's like bringing a deer carcass on a hunting trip. Oh Ted, oh Ted, no, no date.",Barney
"Deer carcass, really? That's the metaphor you're going for?",Ted
"Ted, it's a simile.",Barney
"Well, it's too late now. If I don't bring a date, a $200 piece of chicken-slash-salmon will go uneaten. I gotta bring someone, but who?",Ted
"Well, Derek and I just broke up.",Robin
"No, that's terrible, are you OK?",Lily
"Yeah, do you need a drink or something?",Marshall
"Never really clicked. I felt bad though, he was pretty bummed.",Robin
"Don't b*at yourself up. He'll be fine. I mean, the guy's like a billionaire. He can put his platinum card on a fishing line and reel in 10 chicks hotter than you.",Barney
"Thanks, I feel a lot better. Think I'll get that drink now.",Robin
"OK, guys, I gotta say something. I think my feelings for Robin may be resurfacing.",Ted
"Oh, because they were buried in a shallow grave.",Lily
"Not again. Come on, dude, we all know how this movie ends. Ted falls in love. Love kicks Ted in the sprouts. Roll credits.",Marshall
"No, you guys just have to look at the whole picture. Fact.",Ted
Robin was into me when we first met. Fact.,Ted
"Even though she didn't want a relationship, we had an amazing kiss on the roof. Fact.",Ted
"On New Year's Eve, we kissed again. Fact.",Ted
I need a date to this wedding. Wish me luck,Ted
"What I don't get is, why is Claudia marrying Stuart? She's way hotter than him. How way? Way way.",Barney
"This wedding does sound pretty amazing though. Fancy hotel ballroom, everybody all dressed up.",Marshall
"Ah, here we go.",Lily
What?,Barney
We can't get anywhere with our wedding plans because I want it to be fun and Marshall wants it to be lame.,Lily
"Oh yeah, OK, that's a pretty fair assessment of our two arguments.",Marshall
I thought so.,Lily
"You know what, excuse me if I don't wanna get married barefoot in the woods next to Lake No-one's-gonna-drive-that-far. Yes, I want a ballroom and I want a band and I want shoes.",Marshall
A little girl?,Lily
What up?,Barney
"Yes, but I'm the bride so I win.",Lily
"Well, I thought marriage was about two equal partners sharing a life together.",Marshall
"Right. But I'm the bride, so I win.",Lily
"Seriously, Claudia and Stuart?! I mean, I've hooked up with the odd lass who was beneath my level of attractiveness, but, you know, I was drunk. There's no way Claudia has been drunk for three years.",Barney
"You know, I've always found that the best way to get over a failed relationship is to celebrate someone else's successful one.",Ted
"Well, makes sense.",Robin
"So, with that mind, our friends Claudia and Stuart are having this crazy, black-tie wedding on Saturday. You wanna be my 'plus one'?",Ted
"Ooh, 'plus one', you make it sound so romantic. Ted: Fine. You wanna be my date?",Robin
"Your date? I'd love to. Um, how fancy are we talking about here?",Robin
"Oh, you're gonna wanna bring your A game.",Ted
"Oh, I'll bring it. I'll bring it so hard the bride's gonna look like a big white bag of crap.",Robin
"Lily, I need a dress.",Robin
"You're going. That's awesome. Oh my God, four days to find a dress?",Lily
"I know, it's a su1c1de mission.",Robin
"Well, if we leave now, we can still have a fighting chance. Let's do it.",Lily
Bye babe.,Marshall
"Whoa, did you see how fired up she was? I don't know, there's something there. And come Saturday, a little music, a little dancing, a lot of champagne. Who knows? Barney: Wow, Ted, you're gonna have to find another gender for yourself 'cause I'm revoking your dude membership.",Ted
"Yeah, how was that manicure yesterday?",Ted
"Invigorating, thanks.",Barney
"Hey, Claudia!",Ted
"Yes, I want Tahitian vanilla. You wrote it down wrong? No no no no no, listen to me. If I go to my wedding and the cake is not Tahitian vanilla, I will come down there and burn your little shop to the ground. Do you wanna find out if I'm kidding? Good-bye.",Claudia
"Hey, how's it going? Claudia: My wedding's in two days, that's how it's going.",Ted
"Oh, don't worry, it's gonna be great. I'm so excited.",Ted
"You should be, lots of single girls.",Claudia
"Oh, well, yeah, I'm bringing a date, so I'll be off the market.",Ted
What? Ted: I'm bringing a date.,Claudia
You're not bringing a date.,Claudia
"Uh, yes I am.",Ted
"Uh, no you're not.",Claudia
I checked 'plus one'.,Ted
No you didn't.,Claudia
"Claudia, I'm pretty sure I checked...",Ted
"Ted, you did not check 'plus one', you are not bringing a date to my wedding.",Claudia
But I already invited someone.,Ted
"You are not bringing a guest, Ted. The guest list has been closed for months. Months!",Claudia
But I checked 'plus one'. I always check 'plus one'.,Ted
"You absolutely did not check 'plus one'. If you had checked 'plus one', I would have called you to get the name of your guest so I could get the guest cards printed up. Did I call you to get the name of your guest? Is there a place card with her name card printed on it?",Claudia
"She doesn't need a place card, she knows her name.",Ted
"What's she eating? You ordered the chicken, what did she order? Do you see how your story is full of holes?",Claudia
"Come on, Claudia, we go way back. Isn't there room for just one more person?",Ted
Don't make me hurt you Ted.,Claudia
"I don't believe this, Claudia is crazy.",Ted
"But to be fair, she's also hot.",Barney
"I totally checked 'plus one', I'm sure I did.",Ted
"Yeah, right.",Barney
I did.,Ted
"Yeah, I don't think you did. You know why? Because deep down, you didn't want to show up at this thing with a date. See, for all your big talk about being ready for a relationship, deep down you're single. It's your default setting. Ted, you know what's in the back of your brain?",Barney
"Oh great, here comes the 'little Barney' speech.",Ted
"Behind a curtain, in a dark little room, secretly controlling your every move...",Barney
"A little Barney. And you know what he said?  Ted, you will bring no dates to this wedding. You will hit on drunk bridesmaids with actual-size Barney.",Barney
Wow.,Marshall
Please stop. I gotta call Claudia. If I just explain to her...,Ted
"Ted, no. Let it go. She's about to get married. She's got enough to worry about.",Marshall
Then what am I gonna do?,Ted
The only thing you can do. Tell Robin she can't come.,Marshall
Just a second.,Robin
Hey.,Lily
"Hey, listen.",Ted
"Wait, two things. First of all, I've been laying groundwork all afternoon, totally subtle, totally cool, not pushing, not even nudging. Just the theme of today is Ted rocks. And she's picking up on it lying down.",Lily
Lily's there's a problem.,Ted
"Wait, no, thing number two. The dress, we got a dress.",Lily
Go.,Lily
"Well, did I bring it? Or did I bring it?",Robin
I think I brought it.,Robin
Wow.,Ted
That's what I was going for. I'm so excited about tomorrow. We're gonna have so much fun.,Robin
"Yeah, about that.",Ted
"So, the dress?",Lily
I don't have a 'plus one' for the wedding.,Ted
What?,Lily
I ran into Claudia and she told me I didn't check 'plus one' on the reply card.,Ted
Why didn't you check 'plus...,Lily
I did check 'plus one'.,Ted
But Robin is so excited.,Lily
I know.,Ted
And the dress.,Lily
I know.,Ted
"Oh. OK, OK, we'll, we'll sneak her in.",Lily
"We can't sneak her in, we're not ninjas.",Ted
I wish we were ninjas.,Lily
I know.,Ted
You can always ask Stuart.,Lily
Can I do that?,Ted
"Sure, you guys have been friends for a long time, and it's 40% his wedding too.",Lily
"Oh, it's gonna be a tough sell.",Ted
"Dude, no problem whatsoever.",Stuart
"Really? Stuart: Sure, the more the merrier.",Ted
"Wow, wow, thanks for being so cool about this 'cause you know Claudia said...",Ted
"Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, this morning at the rehearsal, Claudia called our 7-year-old flower girl a whore. So, don't take it personally, she's just a little stressed.",Stuart
"Yeah, she's not usually like that.",Ted
No.,Stuart
"Well, thanks, Stu, it's gonna be a great wedding.",Ted
"Honey, this magazine says more and more couples are opting to have nontraditional weddings out in the woods.",Lily
"Well, if a magazine says so, we should go get married in the woods like a couple of squirrels.",Marshall
"Squirrels don't get married, Marshall.",Lily
Like you could possibly know that.,Marshall
I did it. I did it. I'm taking her to the wedding.,Ted
Nice.,Lily
What? How?,Marshall
I talked to Stuart.,Ted
"Oh, you went around the bride. Oh, this hornet's nest looks harmless. Maybe I'll poke it with a stick. Oh, look, some gremlins, let me go feed them after midnight. Did you known about this?",Marshall
It may have been my idea.,Lily
What? Stuart doesn't get a say.,Lily
"Ha! So you admit it, the groom should have an equal say.",Marshall
"Oh, yeah, sure, on the stupid stuff, like who comes.",Lily
So I can invite whoever I want.,Marshall
"Sure, there's plenty of room in the woods.",Lily
It's Claudia.,Ted
"So, it begins.",Marshall
"Come on, it can't be that bad.",Ted
"Here, Lily, you answer it.",Ted
What? Why?,Lily
Because this whole thing was your idea. And Claudia scares me.,Ted
But...but you're the guy...oh.,Lily
"Ted's phone. Oh, hi Claudia. What?",Lily
"Uh, by the way, honey, Ted stopped by and I told him he could bring his date to the wedding.",Stuart
You what?,Claudia
I told him he could bring a date to the wedding.,Stuart
Always undermining me at every turn.,Claudia
"Try to show a little flexibility, but no, it's all about you.",Stuart
"And your mother, calling me all the time...",Claudia
"You know what, the wedding's off.",Stuart
They broke up.,Lily
Ow!,Ted
"Uh-huh, uh-huh.",Lily
"It's not because of me, is it?",Ted
Uh-huh.,Lily
"My dad already paid for this huge wedding. He's gonna k*ll me. He's gonna k*ll Ted, then I'm gonna k*ll Ted.",Claudia
It's Robin.,Ted
Answer it.,Lily
"Uh, Lily's phone.",Ted
Ted. Where's Lily? I need to tell her about these awesome shoes I just bought.,Robin
"Uh, Lily's busy.",Ted
"Oh, OK, well I just wanted to say they're gorgeous and Ted's gonna love them.",Robin
"That's great. I'll tell Lily to tell me. Uh, listen, I really wanna keep talking but now's not a good time so, um, I'm really excited about tomorrow. OK, bye.",Ted
Bye-bye.,Robin
"Crap, she bought some expensive shoes. She's really looking forward to this. Do you think she's into me?",Ted
"Ted, focus.",Marshall
"Sweetie, just calm down. Do you wanna go somewhere and talk?",Lily
I wanna go somewhere and drink.,Claudia
"OK, meet me at MacLaren's. I'll see you there.",Lily
I feel terrible.,Ted
"Well, feel terrible later. Right now, we gotta fix this. Lily, you go down to the bar and comfort Claudia. Ted and I will go and try to talk some sense into Stuart.",Marshall
Tell Claudia I'm sorry. Did she seem pissed at me?,Ted
"She said if there's no wedding tomorrow, you owe her father $400,000.",Lily
Let's say we get these crazy kids back together.,Ted
"Hi, sad-eyes. What's got you down? Claudia: Stuart and I just broke up.",Barney
"Oh, God, I'm so sorry. That's just, that's just...  two vodka cranberries.",Barney
You remembered I drink vodka cranberries.,Claudia
"Remember? When it comes to you, how could I forget?",Barney
They all drink vodka cranberries.,Barney
"So, is there anything else you need, sweetie?",Barney
"You got $400,000?",Claudia
"No, but I do have a hug.",Barney
Thank you.,Barney
"Stuart, I don't know what to say. If I caused this in any way...",Ted
"Ted, for all I know you did me the biggest favor anyone's every done me.",Stuart
"Oh, come on, man, you don't mean that.",Marshall
"Yeah, I do. This whole thing's made me realize, I miss being single. I miss staying out late and making messes and not cleaning them up. I miss owning p*rn.",Stuart
"Dude, who doesn't.",Marshall
"You know, I'll see some super-hot model chick and I'll think, why am I with Claudia? I can be with her.",Stuart
"That's crazy. I mean, you're the luckiest...you and Claudia both...",Ted
"The point is, I wanna get married, I wanna settle down. But right now, that's just not who I am. I'm not a commitment guy, I'm a single guy.",Stuart
"Stuart, you don't have to be one or the other. Everybody feels this way sometimes.",Ted
"How would you know, you're not even married?",Stuart
"OK, ask this guy. Nine years he's been with Lily. He's the pro. This guy knows relationships. Tell him, Marshall.",Ted
"Stuart, don't get married.",Marshall
Dude.,Ted
What?,Stuart
"I'm sorry. Being in a couple is hard and committing, making sacrifices, it's hard. But if it's the right person, then it's easy. Looking at that girl and knowing she's all you really want out of life, that should be the easiest thing in the world. And if it's not like that, then she's not the one. I'm sorry.",Marshall
"You know I don't have $400,000, right?",Ted
"That's just, that's...  two more vodka cranberries please.",Barney
"Claudia, it's all gonna be OK.",Barney
"Thanks for listening, Barney. Really means a lot to me.",Claudia
"Isn't it weird that we should run into each other like this? Two souls of equal levels of attractiveness, both fitting together like two pieces of a very attractive puzzle.",Barney
"Oh, hell no.",Lily
Oww,Barney
"Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God, if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her, I will take those peanuts you try to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes.",Lily
"Wait, my eyes or my testicles? Lily: One of each.",Barney
"All right, all right.",Barney
Claudia.,Stuart
Stuart. I'm so sorry.,Claudia
I'm so sorry too.,Stuart
I love you.,Claudia
"I love you too, babe. Marshall and Ted set me straight, and when Marshall told me not to marry you, it made me realize...",Stuart
Marshall said what?,Claudia
He made me realize how much I love you. These guys got us back together.,Stuart
"So, where did we land on the whole 'plus one' thing?",Ted
Still wow.,Ted
Wow yourself. Look who else brought it.,Robin
"Oh yeah, I thought about leaving it at home, but I figured I don't wanna get there and realize I need it and have to go all the way back to get it, so, yeah, I brought it.",Ted
Sorry.,Robin
"Hello. Oh my God, tonight? You're kidding. Robin:  They want me to anchor the news tonight.",Robin
"Really? Like, anchor anchor? What happened to Sandy? OK, OK, sure, what time do you need me to...Right now! Oh.",Robin
Do it. Do it.,Ted
"OK, I need like five minutes to change and um, I'll call you from the cab...",Robin
"So, admit it, this wedding is both indoors and amazing.",Marshall
I'll give you the crab puffs. The crab puffs are good.,Lily
Crab puffs were incredible.,Marshall
We should totally have them at our wedding.,Lily
"Definitely. Hey, we just agreed on something.",Marshall
Did we just start planning our wedding?,Lily
I think we did.,Marshall
We totally have to get that brown dipping sauce.,Lily
"Oh, I thought the red sauce was like aweome.",Marshall
"My God, were you born without taste buds? ",Lily
What?,Lily
I love you.,Marshall
"Coming up, are there snakes living in your walls? The answer may surprise you, after the break.",Robin
"Man, you know something, Stuart's my new hero. If that dude can bag a nine, I gotta be able to bag like a sixteen.",Barney
What's a sixteen?,Ted
Those two eight's right over there. Yeah.,Barney
Hi Ted.,Claudia
Claudia.,Ted
We just wanted to get a picture with the woman who almost ended our relationship.,Claudia
"Yeah, where is she?",Stuart
Um  She couldn't make it.,Ted
"What's so funny? Claudia: Plan a wedding, you'll see.",Ted
"Look at that. That's how it's supposed to be, that, right there. Easy. Simple. It's just not like that with Robin. It's not easy, and on some level, it has to just be easy.",Ted
"Speaking of easy, bridesmaids, Ted. Bridesmaids.",Barney
"By the way, I almost forgot. We found this.",Claudia
I didn't check 'plus one'. You were right. Barney: Of course I was right.,Ted
I'm single. Maybe that's just who I am. And you know what? I like being single.,Ted
Being single's the best.,Barney
Stay out as late as you want.,Ted
Answer to no one.,Barney
The whole world full of endless possibilities.,Ted
Never having to go to a farmer's market.,Barney
"OK, ah, doing some math here. Table six has got three bridesmaids, an eight, an eight and a seven. I am willing to give you one of the eight's, lowering myself to a fifteen, which means you owe me...",Barney
"Wow, the Peace Corps?",Tanya
"Yeah, I ship out tomorrow for two years. You know, some people say the Peace Corps is the most noble thing a person can do. To those people, I say, Is it? And usually they say, yes it is.",Barney
"Barney, they are so right. I wish there was something I could do.",Tanya
"Oh, Tanya, I'm so glad you said that.",Barney
"Hey, where the hell did you disappear to last night?",Lily
I had the most amazing night ever.,Ted
"Tell me about it, that cake, best cake I ever had. Seriously. My stomach was like, hey bro, I don't know what you're eating 'cause I don't have any eyes but it's basically awesome so keep sending it down gullet alley.",Marshall
"Yeah, I know. My stomach was like, girlfriend, we don't always get along but that cake...",Lily
Say what?,Marshall
Lily.,Ted
"Oh right. Most amazing night ever, and go.",Lily
"I should tell you, I have a rule. I never hook up at weddings.",Victoria
I'm guessing you haven't always had this rule.,Ted
"Well, here's the thing. Those big romantic moments, they're great when they happen, but they're not real.",Victoria
"Exactly. Exactly, like, like just now, when I saw you doing the chicken dance out there, I'm not gonna lie to you, big time thunderbolt.",Ted
You should see me tap-dance. You'd be down on bended knee.,Victoria
Sadly not out of character. But I know now it's just a mirage.,Ted
Wedding goggles.,Victoria
"Exactly. And that, in a nutshell, is why I'm not putting the moves on you.",Ted
This isn't the moves?,Victoria
"What, you think this is the moves? Believe me, you'd know the moves. People ten tables away would know the moves.",Ted
That's too bad.,Victoria
Tell me about it.,Ted
"You know, I think I have a solution.",Victoria
Interested.,Ted
"And, to preface this, we're not going to sleep together tonight.",Victoria
Less interested.,Ted
Go ahead.,Ted
"OK. So the thing that always screws it up is the next day, right? So, why don't we just cut that part out.",Victoria
What are you saying?,Ted
"I'm saying, I'm here, you're here, and this is a big, romantic wedding. Why don't we just dance and have a great time and then when it's over, never see each other again.",Victoria
Unless...,Ted
"No, no unless. No emails, no phone numbers, not even names. Tonight we will make a memory that will never be tarnished. And then, when we're old and gray, we'll look back on this night and it'll be perfect.",Victoria
"Wow. OK, I'm in.",Ted
OK.,Victoria
"I guess, what, we'll need fake names?",Ted
"Um, you can call me Buttercup.",Victoria
"Pleased to meet you, Buttercup. I'm Lando Calrissian.",Ted
"Wow, this is kind of exciting. Our names will forever be shrouded...",Ted
"Ted, Ted, Ted, look, I got a bridesmaid, Ted, look, look, Ted, the second hottest bridesmaid, Ted, look. See ya Ted.",Barney
"So, I'm Ted.",Ted
Victoria. But no last names.,Victoria
No last names.,Ted
Oh.,Marshall
"Oh, what is wrong with you?",Lily
"Dude, that is just like... a weenie ass idea.",Marshall
"No, it was awesome. I had a great night, I'm never gonna see her again, and there's no way to ruin it.",Ted
"Ted, how do I explain this to you? Last night I had the best cake of my life. You think I'm gonna let that cake out of my life? Hell, no. I'm gonna find out what bakery made that cake and then I'm gonna get some more cake.",Marshall
"That cake really got to you, huh?",Ted
It haunts me.,Marshall
"So, what happened next?",Lily
Mm-hm.,Ted
Now let's see some of these moves I've heard so much about.,Victoria
Wait wait wait wait wait.,Victoria
Let's do all the single ladies in this joint a big favor and steal the bouquet.,Victoria
"Yes, but we'll need a diversion.",Ted
Kiss.,Ted
"Go. Go, go, go",Ted
"So, that's what happened to the bouquet. You know, good for Victoria. It's such an evil tradition.",Lily
You're not gonna do it at your wedding?,Ted
"Oh, yeah, I'm gonna take that flower grenade and chuck it into the crowd and scream, crawl for it, bitches. It's just what girls do.",Lily
"So, where did you guys go?",Marshall
Very nice.,Ted
Yeah?,Victoria
"OK, I don't really know how to tap-dance.",Victoria
I couldn't really tell.,Ted
"Well, it's too bad you're not gonna get some tonight.",Ted
"Oh, if I wanted some, I could get some.",Victoria
No you couldn't.,Ted
You're a dude. I could totally...,Victoria
Totally get some.,Ted
We're not gonna kiss tonight.,Victoria
"If we kiss, all of this becomes real. You, you might use too much tongue, or not use enough and then suddenly, poof, spell's broken.",Victoria
I will use exactly the right amount of tongue.,Ted
"OK, how about this? The best part of any first-kiss is the lead-up to it, the moment right before the lips touch. It's like a big drumroll. So, how about, tonight, we just stick with the drumroll.",Victoria
OK.,Ted
But we can't kiss.,Victoria
OK.,Ted
"A drumroll? That's it. So, what, you just said good-night, came home, and performed a drum solo?",Marshall
"Oh, Ted, you're such a doof. I mean, this girl sounds amazing.",Lily
"She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and we connected on every level. And, I'm never gonna see her again.",Ted
"Dammit, I have to see her again.",Ted
"So, let's get to work, man. What else do you know about her?",Marshall
"Nothing. Her name's Victoria, that's all I got. Wait, Claudia, Claudia would know.",Ted
"Well, Claudia's on her honeymoon. She'll be back in two weeks. Call her then.",Lily
"Yes, two weeks, good idea. I'm calling her now.",Ted
"No, Ted, you don't mess with a honeymoon.",Lily
"Yeah, come on, dude. Ask her about the cake.",Marshall
Ted?,Claudia
"Oh, you have got to be freakin kidding me.",Claudia
"Oh, here we go.",Stuart
"24 hours ago, you were begging, begging me to bring some other girl to my wedding, and now, what, you're over her?",Claudia
I've moved on.,Ted
"What was her name? Was it my fat cousin, Lindsay? Don't be embarrassed. She has pretty eyes.",Claudia
"Uh, no, her name was Victoria, I don't know her last name.",Ted
"Well, lucky for you, I know that guest list backwards and forwards.",Claudia
Thank God.,Ted
"Unlucky for you, there was no Victoria at my wedding. Good-bye, Ted.",Claudia
There was no Victoria at the wedding.,Ted
"Maybe she used a second fake name. Oh, she's good, she's very good.",Lily
"Maybe she was a ghost. That's why she didn't wanna kiss you, because you'd just pass right through her and feel really cold for a second. Oh my God, I just had a great idea for a screenplay.",Marshall
Marshall. She was not a ghost.,Ted
"I know that she wasn't a ghost, she picked up a bouquet, proving she had corporeal form.",Marshall
"Wait, wait, wait, she was sitting across from a couple of bridesmaids. She must have been at their table. Maybe they know who she was?",Ted
Great. How do we get in touch with the bridesmaids?,Lily
"This better be good, I'm about to enter nirvana. By the way, I should give you Nirvana's phone number, she gives a great massage. Say what?",Barney
Barney.,Nirvana
Ow. I know the house rules. Es un chiste.,Barney
"Uh, listen, Barney, I saw you talking to that bridesmaid last night. Did you happen to get her phone number?",Ted
You know I did.,Barney
Great. I'm gonna need you to call her for me.,Ted
You know I won't.,Barney
Why not?,Ted
"Because we just hooked up last night. I can't call the girl the next day. I have to wait at least, like, forever. Oh snap. Never gonna call her. Besides, she thinks I'm on my way to India.",Barney
"Oh, come on, Barney. It's for a good cause.",Lily
"Ted going all castrati over another girl is exactly not a good cause. Sorry, buddy, I wish I could help you, my hands are tied. Oh no, wait, that was last night.",Barney
"OK, Barney, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. You make this call and I will go with you to Foxy Boxing.",Ted
Really? Ted: Yeah.,Barney
But you always said that Foxy Boxing girls were neither foxy nor good at boxing.,Barney
I'm ready to be proven wrong.,Ted
Tonight? Ted: Tonight. Dial.,Barney
"Yeah, Tanya, turns out I don't leave for the Peace Corps until tomorrow. Yeah, I know, sucks. Just one fewer day I get to help people. Anyway, this girl, any idea who she was? Hold on.",Barney
What kind of shoes...,Barney
"Tanya, he's a dude. He's not gonna know what kind of shoes she was wearing.",Barney
Actually.,Ted
Oh come on.,Barney
Hey.,Victoria
"So, what do you want to do next?",Ted
Uh...,Victoria
Don't think...first thing that comes into your mind.,Ted
Hold this.,Victoria
Whoa. There she goes.,Ted
Apparently she was wearing brown shoes with little snowflakes on them.,Barney
"Sorry, Ted, I won't be able to make foxy boxing tonight.",Barney
I understand.,Ted
"OK, let's not lose hope. We'll call the hotel, maybe she was staying there. We'll have them check the registry for anyone named Victoria. Or maybe she goes by Vicky or Tori...",Lily
Or Ictor. Probably doesn't go by Ictor.,Marshall
"No, you know what? This is fate. I am never supposed to see this girl again. That was the whole point of the night. I've just been saved from myself. Let's drink many beers.",Ted
Agreed.,Marshall
"Hey, there's the anchor lady! How was it?",Lily
"Oh, I don't know. Why don't you ask the new substitute weekend anchor. Robin? Thanks, Robin, it was awesome. Back to you, Robin.",Robin
"Congrats, that's so cool.",Lily
"Yeah, I felt really bad bailing on Ted though.",Robin
"Oh, don't even worry about it. In fact...",Lily
What?,Lily
I know who she is.,Robin
"You know who she is? But, you weren't even at the wedding.",Lily
"Actually, I kind of was.",Robin
What?,Lily
"Well, after the newscast, I was so excited, I decided to surprise Ted by going to the reception.",Robin
Dammit. Stop it. What the hell?,Robin
Hello? You OK in there?,Victoria
"Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Just allergies or something. I'm fine.",Robin
"Listen, do you wanna come and cry out here? I've been told I'm an excellent hugger.",Victoria
"Oh, thanks, but I don't actually cry in front of people, or cry at all for that matter. Man, it's gross. Does everyone snot up this much when they cry?",Robin
"Hey, you're speaking to a fellow snotter. So, why are you crying?",Victoria
Because you have feelings for Ted.,Lily
"I don't know, maybe.",Robin
"OK, what is wrong with the two of you?! Seriously. He likes you and you like him, just, just, just be together. Geez, Louise, happiness is not that difficult.",Lily
"Oh, look, OK. Yes, I cried in the bathroom, and that was weird. But that doesn't mean I'm in love with the guy. The fact is I don't know how I feel.",Robin
Yes you do. Seeing him with someone else and crying about it. Guess what? That's how you feel. That is nothing but how you feel.,Lily
"OK, fine, I have feelings for him. Happy? Lily: Kinda, yeah.",Robin
But it doesn't change anything. I still don't wanna get married and he's still... Ted. What I should do is just tell him who Victoria is so he could be happy.,Robin
Or you could tell him you're into him and then you could both be happy.,Lily
I'm gonna go find him.,Robin
"Well, wait. Which one are you gonna tell him?",Lily
I have no idea.,Robin
"And here's the most amazing part. Because I told her I converted all my money to India dollars, she gave me fifty bucks to take a cab to the airport. That's right, I just got paid for sex.",Barney
I really should give this money to the Peace Corps. They've done so much for me lately.,Barney
"Hi, guys,",Robin
Hey.,Ted
"Um, Ted, can I talk to you outside for a second?",Robin
Sure. What's up?,Ted
"Uh, I, I have to tell you something.",Robin
Oh.,Ted
"Oh, just get it.",Robin
Hello.,Ted
"Ted, it's Stuart. My lovely bride would like to say something to you.",Stuart
Ted. I'm sorry I hung up on you earlier. My new husband and a vodka cranberry which cost $10.50 at the freakin' airport bar. When is this plane going to board?!,Claudia
Sweet pea.,Stuart
Have helped me realize that sometimes I can act like a crazy person. And I don't want my new husband to think I'm a crazy person.,Claudia
"It's fine, Claudia. Don't worry about it.",Ted
"Oh, um, Marshall wanted to know where you guys got that cake.",Ted
Cake.,Claudia
Why don't you take this? Sounds like you could use it.,Victoria
"Thanks. You're very sweet. So, are you a friend of the bride or groom?",Robin
We got it at this little bakery downtown.,Claudia
"Actually, neither.",Victoria
It's called the Buttercup Bakery.,Claudia
I made the cake.,Victoria
She made the cake.,Ted
Buttercup Bakery. She wasn't on the guest list because she wasn't a guest. She made the cake.,Ted
"She made that cake. Ted, this is the girl. You gotta marry her, today. She has to move in with us.",Marshall
I'm going down to that bakery.,Ted
"No, no, don't do it.",Lily
"Baby, what are you talking about?!",Marshall
"Yeah, all day long, you've been busting my apple bag about finding this girl.",Ted
"Well, I just think that maybe she's not that into you and that's why she didn't give you her number. Robin, care to chime in with anything? Robin: Yes. Ted. Go get her.",Lily
Going. Getting.,Ted
"Ted, oh my gosh, I love this moment. You know why? Because I'm gonna say it and this time you're actually gonna say yes. You ready? You ready to say yes? Ted, suit up!",Barney
Yes! No.,Ted
Oh come on!,Barney
Whoa. Guess we were gone a while.,Ted
"Well, that's too bad. I was looking forward to one last dance.",Victoria
"Why yes I am. Sorry, I could tell what you were just thinking.",Ted
"Wow, what was I thinking?",Victoria
"Damn, he's looking mighty fine in that tux.",Ted
"You got me, you are good.",Victoria
"You know, I don't look like this every day. On a real weekend, the real Ted wears a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt with bleach stains on it.",Ted
The real Ted sounds real sexy. It's too bad I'll never get to see it.,Victoria
Buttercup Bakery. This is it.,Lily
"Good luck, dude. Grab me a cupcake.",Marshall
"Ted, you still with us?",Barney
Tell me your last name.,Ted
"You know, there's one little flaw in our plan.",Ted
What's that?,Victoria
I'm gonna go home tonight with a lot of great memories and one really sucky memory: the memory of you walking out that door.,Ted
"Hey, Ted.",Victoria
Yeah?,Ted
"Close your eyes, and count to five.",Victoria
"One, two, three, four, five.",Ted
"And to our dying day, we will remember everything about that night as perfect. Maybe we both need that. So many things go wrong in life, but this is the one thing that never will. It'll always, always be pure, unadulterated awesome. If I walk in there, I'm robbing both of us of what could be...",Ted
"The meter's running, dude. Crap or get off the pot.",Barney
OK.,Ted
Oh thank God.,Victoria
"They have to come out soon, it's Monday.",Marshall
Do you think they've been in there the whole time? I don't know whether to be proud or concerned.,Lily
Maybe they're not even in there.,Marshall
Good morning.,Victoria
"Hey, guys.",Ted
I'm just going to ignore that.,Victoria
Thank you!,Marshall
I wish you could stay.,Ted
"I know, me, too. But I have to go to work, and you have that meeting.",Victoria
Call you afterwards?,Ted
I'll inappropriately text you during. Bye.,Victoria
Bye.,Ted
Two days straight?!,Marshall
"Wow, your room must smell like a monkey cage!",Lily
"Come on, give us a number. Lily guessed eight, but I know my boy got to double digits.",Marshall
Zero.,Ted
What?,Marshall
What?,Lily
"Guys, we just met. And we both screwed up relationships in the past by jumping in too quick, so we talked about it, and we decided to take this one slow.",Ted
Her idea.,Marshall
"Totally her idea! But, I don't know, I'm really into this girl, and if going slow is what it takes to make this happen, I say bring it on.",Ted
I don't feel so good. t's like my testicles mixed pop rocks and soda.,Ted
I can't believe she's making you wait a whole month. I would never put up with that.,Marshall
You've only had sex with one girl in your whole life.,Ted
Burn!,Lily
"Ted, the only reason to wait a month for sex is if the girl is 17 years, 11 months old.",Barney
Good news: I don't have to cover the cat show tomorrow night. Who's up for hanging out?,Robin
"Oh, I can't, I'm taking Victoria out for dinner.",Ted
"No, no, we can't, it's our nine-year anniversary.",Lily
"Wow, nine years? Your relationship's a fourth grader. Congrats.",Robin
Thanks. We're going to the Berkshires for the maple syrup harvest.,Lily
It's one of New York Magazine's Top five romantic getaways on a budget. Who says sexual can't be sensible?,Marshall
"Well, looks like it's going to be just you and me.",Robin
Really?,Barney
"Actually, I was talking to my martini.",Robin
Ready to go?,Marshall
"Hell, yeah. Nothing better than a weekend at a good bed and breakfast.",Lily
Yeah. Waking up for breakfast at 7:00 A.M....Sharp.,Marshall
Complimenting the odors and their collection of needle-point geese.,Lily
Awkward conversations with middle-aged couples trying to stave off divorce.,Marshall
"Yeah, well, we'd better get going, it's like a four-hour drive.",Lily
And it's supposed to rain tonight.,Marshall
Or we could just stay home.,Lily
Maybe watch some TV.,Marshall
Order in some Chinese.,Lily
"Oh, Sichuan Garden! Are we really bailing?",Marshall
"Hell, yeah.",Lily
"Good, cause this thing's empty.",Marshall
"Hundred dollars says when you turn around, I say wow.",Barney
"Barney, this is the third time you've hit on me by accident.",Robin
It's one of the many risks of the blind approach. It's usually a two-man operation where Ted signals that the target is hot. But Ted's too busy being in a lesbian relationship.,Barney
Why don't you just check out the girl's reflection in the bar mirror?,Robin
You can't just... Wow!,Barney
Hey? What's taking so long? I have to go.,Robin
"Not so fast, Scherbotsky. I like the way you think. That mirror thing. Simple. Elegant. Okay, limited-time offer: I need a bro for my bro-ings on about town. How would you like to be said bro?",Barney
"Well, as tempting as that sounds, I'm hanging out with my friend who just got dumped. She really needs some support... or a stranger's tongue down her throat. That seems healthy. All right. Guess I'm in.",Robin
So... one more week and it'll be a month.,Victoria
"Really? Are you sure? Wow, that snuck up on me.",Ted
"Oh, come on.",Victoria
The 18th can't get here fast enough.,Ted
"Wait, the 18th? Oh, crap! I can't believe I forgot this... I'm going to be out of town on the 18th!",Victoria
"Oh. Well, um, we can just... wait until you get back. I mean, the whole point was not to rush into this.",Ted
Yeah. Or we could do it tonight.,Victoria
75th and Amsterdam.,Ted
I'm so glad we decided to just stay home.,Lily
"Oh, I know. Can you imagine if we'd gone? We'd be just getting there now, all tired and cranky.",Marshall
And yet we'd feel obligated to have sex.,Lily
"Yeah, for 89 bucks a night, we're doing it. I would like to propose a toast. To the most awesomely mellow anniversary ever.",Marshall
I'm so glad you have to go to your parents' next weekend.,Ted
I'm so glad your roommates are out of town.,Victoria
"Oh, my God, what are they doing home?",Lily
"They think we went away. Oh, it is on for my boy, Ted.",Marshall
"But we didn't go away, we're in the bathroom.",Lily
They don't know that. All we have to do is hide out in here until Ted moves his mojo into the bedroom.,Marshall
But I don't want to hide out in here.,Lily
"Honey, Ted has been going out of his mind waiting for this. If we go out there and spoil the mood, it's not going to happen. Then one of us is going to have to have sex with Ted, and... not going to be me.",Marshall
"Okay, fine. I guess I'll actually floss.",Lily
You suited up!,Barney
"Well, I figured if I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this right.",Robin
Emilio? The woman will have...,Barney
"I'll have a Johnny Walker Blue, neat, and a Montecristo No. 2 Thanks.",Robin
"Ah, the No. 2, a.k.a. The Torpedo. Or, as the rollers call it, Piramide.",Barney
"My father was a cigar fanatic, it was the only way to get his attention.",Robin
Father issues. Hot.,Barney
I know... I was this close to being a huge slut.,Robin
"Slut would have been better, but I'll settle for bro. Especially now that Ted's with Victoria and can't drink. Because he's pregnant. Cause he's the girl.",Barney
"Oh, come on, Ted can't be pregnant. You need to have sex to get pregnant.",Robin
What up! Freeze frame high five!,Barney
I think this may be a perfect moment. I wish we could hold onto it forever.,Victoria
"No. Because the beauty of a moment is that it's fleeting. By its very nature, it... slips through our fingers... making it that much more precious.",Ted
"Ugh, that is bad. That is, like, high-school-literary-magazine bad.",Lily
And they're not even high.,Marshall
It's actually working.,Lily
"Yeah, smooth but slowly. God, close the deal, already. It's been, like, 45 minutes... we could have had sex three times by now.",Marshall
"Yeah, try five.",Lily
What up! Maybe we should just go out there.,Marshall
No way! We can't go out there now. They'll know that we've been sitting in the bathroom the whole time. It'll be too weird.,Lily
Fine. But if we're stuck in here... I'm turning up the volume. Shh. Shh.,Marshall
"I want to know you. Like, know your soul. Ted, what makes you cry?",Victoria
"Honey, could you hold my hair back, I think I'm going to hurl.",Lily
So. What do you and Ted usually do after the cigar bar?,Robin
Are you kidding? Ted's never been here. You've already flown higher and faster than he ever did. Still...,Barney
What?,Robin
There is one other thing we could do. If you're up for it.,Barney
"Oh, I had no idea laser tag still existed!",Robin
"Yeah, well, enjoy it before it becomes cool again. I give it two months.",Barney
"Oh, I believe it... this is awesome!",Robin
"Okay, follow my lead, stay low, and never underestimate a 12-year-old with a... Scherbotsky, you have to focus! You just saved my life, didn't you?",Barney
Thank me later. Let's keep moving. These little bastards are everywhere.,Robin
He's just staring into her eyes.,Marshall
"I don't know, we used to be even more nauseatingly into each other than Ted and Victoria. Now look at us.",Lily
Yeah... now we just make fun of people like that. It's the circle of life.,Marshall
"No, I'm serious, Marshall. I mean, we couldn't even get it up to go on our big trip. And now we're celebrating our anniversary stuck in a bathroom.",Lily
"Well, it's not fair to compare us to Ted and Victoria. This is their first time.",Marshall
"Yeah, but we could still have some more romance. Now, you just say, Want to do it? And I say, Yeah.",Lily
Want to...,Marshall
No! Maybe we're just out of firsts.,Lily
Looks like they're about to have theirs.,Marshall
Should we take this to the bedroom?,Ted
Yes!,Marshall
Yes!,Lily
Yes.,Victoria
Yes!,Marshall
Yes!,Lily
"No. No, don't answer it!",Marshall
You can answer it. We have all night.,Victoria
You're answering it? He's answering it!,Marshall
No! Do her! Do her now!,Lily
Sure. Good luck with that. ,Ted
How about a little more wine?,Victoria
I'll get another bottle.,Ted
I need a drink. Do we have any cough syrup in here?,Lily
Shh...,Marshall
"Oh, God. These brats have us completely surrounded. I counted nine, maybe ten. I'll lay down some cover fire, you make a run for it.",Robin
No. Leave no man behind. Either we all get out of here or no one does.,Barney
But I...,Robin
"Don't be a hero, Scherbotsky.",Barney
See you on the other side.,Robin
Damn. Want to go get a soft pretzel?,Barney
Yeah.,Robin
All right.,Barney
"Marshall, what happened to us? We used to just stare into each other's eyes all night long. Have we lost that?",Lily
"Maybe. But I think I just found it. Right here. Baby, I'm giving you sexy smoldering with just a hint of crazy eyes.",Marshall
"Okay, well, get ready for my sex-ray vision. Did you remember to pick up the dry cleaning? Oh, damn it.",Lily
It's all right. We can do this.,Marshall
Let's just hold hands. This is nice.,Lily
You love that move. It's a classic Marshall.,Marshall
"All right, we totally suck at this. We really, really need to get out of here.",Lily
"Well, we can't.",Marshall
"Baby, there's something I have to do, and if I do it in front of you, it'll change the entire nature of our relationship.",Lily
What is it?,Marshall
I have to pee.,Lily
This is bad.,Marshall
Yeah.,Lily
We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other. You always think there'll be more time.,Marshall
"Look at us. We're basically an old married couple, and we're not even married yet. The flame of our romance is flickering, and if I pee all over it, it might go out forever.",Lily
How much longer do you think you can hold it?,Marshall
I drank a Big Gulp of Mountain Dew during that Quantum Leap marathon.,Lily
"Oh, boy.",Marshall
Playing laser tag really takes me back. You know what game I really miss? Battleship. I've never lost a game.,Robin
Neither have I. Of course I cheat.,Barney
"Oh, yeah, me, too. The trick is to bend the aircraft carrier so it makes an L.",Robin
Ah. I always just stacked the ships on top of each other.,Barney
"Nice. You know, we should have a cheaters grudge match. I think I still have a... Hello. Target acquired. Hottie by the jukebox.",Robin
"Ooh, good eye, Scherbotsky. I got someone for you. Two o'clock, blue shirt.",Barney
That's a woman.,Robin
"Oh, my mistake. Or is it?",Barney
Let's just focus on your target.,Robin
Right.,Barney
"Yeah, I got this one. Oh, my God. I love your jeans.",Robin
Okay. Is this a lesbian bar? Because that girl with the blue shirt just...,Woman
"Oh, no. I am all about the dudes. Although pickings are pretty slim tonight. Only hot guy here is blondie in the suit, and he's playing hard to get.",Robin
Really? 'Cause he's totally vibing me right now. Must be the jeans.,Woman
"Well, jeans will only get you so far. I'm going home with him.",Robin
We'll see about that.,Woman
"Oh, my God, I hate Ted. I hate him so much.",Lily
"Baby, why don't you just go? Tons of other couples have peed in front of each other.",Marshall
"No, but we haven't, because I want to keep some of the mystery alive.",Lily
"Well, you have farted in front of me.",Marshall
"Yes, but I always cover it with a cough.",Lily
You always do.,Marshall
Hey.,Barney
Hey.,Robin
Let's get out of here. Let's go somewhere else.,Barney
What happened?,Robin
"Eh, you sometimes like to do a little catch and release.",Barney
But why?,Robin
Leave no man behind. Either we all score or no one scores.,Barney
"Right on. Hey, you want to go play Battleship?",Robin
Hit!,Barney
"Ted, I can't wait any longer.",Victoria
Should we move to the bedroom?,Ted
There's no time for that.,Victoria
"They can suck on each other's fingers for an hour, but there's no time to take two steps to the bedroom?",Marshall
"Baby, I can't hold it in any longer. It's time.",Lily
I know.,Marshall
"I love you, Marshall.",Lily
"I love you, Lily.",Marshall
"Well, you make a good bro. You're a better Ted than Ted. Hey, in fact, you have just earned yourself an invite to Marshall's bachelor party. And you don't even have to come out of the cake.",Barney
"Thanks. And, um, thanks for sticking around tonight. I hope you're ready for some hard-core Battleship. Come on, boys.",Robin
Hard-core? That's the only way I play. (,Barney
I found it. Are you ready to... What the hell are you doing?,Robin
"I'm birthday suiting up.vI'm sorry, did you want to undress me?",Barney
No! I thought we were just hanging out as friends.,Robin
"Oh, come on, you have been throwing yourself at me all night.",Barney
What?! I did the opposite! I threw some other girl at you.,Robin
You invited me up to your apartment to play Battleship. Is that not an internationally recognized term for sex?,Barney
No.,Robin
Great. I hope you're happy. You sunk my battleship.,Barney
I'm okay. You okay?,Lily
"I feel the same. And yet, strangely different.",Marshall
"I'm happy for my bladder, yet sad for us.",Lily
"You had to do it, sweetie... for Ted. And, hey, look, at least now we can stay in here as long as it takes.",Marshall
"Yeah. I guess our relationship had to take a hit so a new one out there could blossom. Oh, crap!",Lily
They must have heard that.,Marshall
"Well, I guess we can come out now. I don't believe it. They're gone.",Lily
Good. 'Cause I got to take a whiz.,Marshall
"Okay, you and me, that's insane. If you even thought about it for one second...",Robin
"But I have thought about it for three seconds, and it makes a lot of sense. We both think the marriage commitment thing's a drag. We both want something casual and fun. And we clearly get along really well.",Barney
"Wow, that actually did make a lot of sense. But what about Ted?",Robin
I checked with Ted.,Barney
"Ted, so now that things with you and Victoria are going pretty well, I assume you're over all the girls you were into before, right? I take your silence as a yes, so say I were to hook up with someone, say Robin, you'd be cool with that, right?",Barney
Sure. Good luck with that.,Ted
Totally gave us his blessing.,Barney
Really?,Robin
Really.,Barney
So Ted didn't care that you wanted to make a move on me?,Robin
Didn't care at all. Oh. Oh...,Barney
What?,Robin
You like Ted.,Barney
I didn't say I liked Ted.,Robin
You like Ted. Wow. This is huge.,Barney
"Barney, I don't like Ted. He's moved on, and I'm really happy for...",Robin
"Yeah, yeah. Look, are we gonna play Battleship or what?",Barney
"You're not gonna tell him, are you?",Robin
No. That's the bro code. A bro doesn't tell a mutual bro that a third bro has a crush on him. Just like the third bro doesn't tell the mutual bro that the original bro went bare pickle in front of her. It's quid pro bro.,Barney
A-7.,Robin
Miss.,Barney
Of course.,Robin
"Well, we still have one frontier left. Still got the deuce.",Marshall
Not making me feel better.,Lily
"Well, it certainly was a first.",Marshall
"It was, wasn't it? We still have firsts.",Lily
"Of course we do. And you know what, I actually feel closer to you now. I want to know you. Like, know your soul.",Marshall
"Marshall, what makes you cry?",Lily
This moment is fleeting because it's being chased by another moment.,Marshall
"Oh, just grab my boob already.",Lily
"Come on, guys, get a room.",Ted
You don't have to shout out poker when you win.,Ted
I know. It's just fun to say.,Marshall
"It's called Marsh-gammon. It combines all the best features of all the best games... Candy Land, I Never, Pictionary.",Marshall
"Backgammon, obviously.",Robin
"No. Backgammon sucks. I took the only good part of backgammon, the gammon, and I left the rest of it in the trash where it belongs.",Marshall
I'm so excited Victoria's coming.,Lily
I'm going to go get another round.,Robin
"Okay, I want to lay down some ground rules for tonight. Barney, I actually like Victoria... a lot, so don't say anything embarrass... Don't say anything. And guys, I haven't exactly told Victoria that I used to have a kind of thing for Robin, so we you could just avoid the...",Ted
"Well, well, well. How rich. You make me promise to be on my best behavior around your girlfriend, yet, you have been lying to her since day one. Excuse me.Hi. Leg Warehouse? Yeah, my friend Ted needs something to stand on. So, nothing for him to stand on? Okay, and thanks so much. Ted, doesn't Victoria deserve to know that you once had the hots for Robin? I have half a mind to tell the story of the re-return.",Barney
No. I-I swore you to secrecy on that.,Ted
"Ooh, I am smelling dirt. What is the story of the re-return?",Lily
"Nothing. It's nothing. And speaking of digging up dirt, can I count on you two to behave around Victoria?",Ted
Us? What would we do?,Lily
"Look, um, you guys have always been like the parents that I still have and, in fact, moved here to get away from. However, could we skip the traditional interrogation of the new girlfriend tonight?",Ted
Fine.,Marshall
Fine.,Lily
Thank you.,Ted
I should go help Robin.,Lily
Hey.,Robin
"Hey. So, are you going to be okay hanging out with Victoria tonight?",Lily
"Oh, sure. She's great. Oh, what? Because of the whole thing where I said I liked Ted? No. Victoria's great. She's fun, she's free-spirited, she's great. I said, She's great too many times, didn't I?",Robin
You must really hate the bitch.,Lily
"But if you roll an even number while adjacent to the Peppermint Forest, then you Marshall out, and all your chips go into the pot, and remember, if you ever ask the question What?, then... you got to drink. Got it?",Marshall
No,All
"Okay, okay, no, no, we'll just start, you guys'll pick it up. Newbie goes first. Roll.",Marshall
Okay.,Victoria
"Three! You got Autobiography. Now, that's where you have to answer a personal question about your dating life truthfully in order to move on.",Marshall
"Marshall, come on.",Ted
"Hey, she's the one who rolled a three. Victoria, Have you ever cheated while in a relationship? Wow, good question.",Marshall
You don't have to answer that.,Ted
"It's okay. Um, well, I was in a really crappy relationship in college, and I wound up kissing this guy at a party one night, and I felt terrible about it, so, I came clean, and we broke up.",Victoria
"Victoria, that was an honest and mature answer. You may advance to The Gumdrop Mountains.",Marshall
"So Victoria, did you ever re-return to this guy?",Barney
What?,Victoria
"You said what, you got to drink!",Marshall
"Oh, Barney, by the way, I went to a party in that new building on 82nd, and the host said she knew you. What is her name? Sharon? Shannon?",Lily
"Shannon?! Shannon, Shannon... No, don't remember any Shannon.",Barney
"Really? Well, 'cause she gave me a videotape to give...",Lily
Where's the tape?,Barney
Fine. I'll go get it.,Lily
"Cool, okay. You know, whenever.",Barney
"Okay, Robin, your roll. Five! Another Autobiography... for the player to your left, which... Victoria!",Marshall
Of course.,Ted
"Victoria, How many boyfriends did you have before you started dating Ted?",Marshall
"Wait, the card actually says Ted?",Ted
"Okay, uh, well, boyfriends--I guess I've only had... two.",Victoria
Prude alert.,Robin
Well... that's serious boyfriends. I've dated other guys in between.,Victoria
"Oh, slut alert!",Robin
"Oh, great, there it is. Thanks, Lily. You're a peach. Oh, wow, look at that. Robin landed on the Chocolate Swamp. That's five chips for me.",Barney
Thank you! Finally somebody understands Marsh-gammon.,Marshall
"Barney, what was on that tape?",Lily
Too bad you'll never find out.,Barney
"Oh, damn it! If only I'd given you a fake tape and hidden the real tape in my purse. Oh, wait. That's exactly what I did.",Lily
What?!,Barney
Drink!,Marshall
"Yeah, you were acting so weird about it, I gave you Ted's graduation tape instead. So, should we pop it in?",Lily
"Give it to me, give it, give me...",Barney
"Play the tape, play it, play it!",Ted
"Ted! Fine, fine. You cannot play it. Shannon! I love you! I love you so much. What about us changing the world together? Don't tell me you've forgotten. I know I haven't. Will I ever see another rainbow? Will an eagle ever soar through this tempest of woe? Baby, please Don't go There's a thief in the palace, she's stolen all my love There's a thief in the palace and she's...",Barney
Did you try his cell phone?,Marshall
"Yeah, I left two messages. I checked the cigar club, the Lusty Leopard. He's off the grid.",Ted
"Hey, guys, what up?",Barney
"Barney, where have you been?",Robin
"Yeah, we're-we're really sorry about that.",Ted
"Yeah, so sorry. But seriously, what was up with the tape? No, no, stay.",Lily
Come on. Stay!,All
"I'm sorry. I don't want to talk about it. It was the most embarrassing, and humiliating thing that ever happened to me.",Barney
"Well, we all have embarrassing stories. Sometimes it's good to-to talk about it.",Marshall
"Oh, really? Then why don't you tell us your most humiliating moment, Marshall? Show me how good it is.",Barney
All right.,Marshall
"I was stopping by Lily's kindergarten class to say hi, but they were all at recess. I really had to pee, so I went into the class's restroom. It was a-a smaller target than I'm used to, so I figured I should sit down. What I didn't realize was, it was a shared bathroom. I wish I'd pulled up my pants.",Marshall
The kids still call him Funny Butt.,Lily
"Okay. I'll tell you my story. Believe it or not, I was not always as awesome as I am today.",Barney
"It was 1998. I was just out of college, and I was working at a coffeehouse with my girlfriend. My girlfriend... *Shannon. Yeah, you were meant for me And I was meant for you. Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh.* Thank you. All right.",Barney
"I love your singing, Barney.",Shannon
"And I love you, Shannon.",Barney
Joining the Peace Corps with you is gonna be legendary.,Shannon
I know. Only five short weeks till we're down in Nicaragua.,Barney
"Hey, nonfat latte to go.",Man
"Mellow order, bro, mellow order.",Barney
"Dude, that your g-friend? All right, high five!",Man
"Sorry, I only give high twos.",Barney
Whatevs. As long as you're nailing that.,Man
"Listen to you. That? You know, women aren't objects. They're human beings. And FYI, Shannon and I have decided to wait till we're married. You can read about it in my zine.",Barney
"Hey, haircut, right here. Open up your knowledge basket, 'cause here it comes. Forget that touchy-feely crap. You get money, you get laid. End of discussion.",Man
"I feel sorry for you, man.",Barney
"Peace out, hombre.",Man
"Suits. Five weeks later, we were all set to leave for the Peace Corps. Only problem was... she never showed up.",Barney
She never showed?,Robin
"So, what happened next?",Ted
You know what? This was a mistake.,Barney
Wait... What if somebody else told their most humiliating story?,Lily
"Oh, I know just how to decide who.",Marshall
You brought the game to the bar?,Lily
"Well, we're not quitting just 'cause Ted's so far ahead.",Marshall
I was winning?,Ted
Fine. I'll go next.,Robin
I was doing a report on live TV about a hansom cab driver.,Robin
Not the slipping-in-horse-poop story!,Barney
"Yeah, we all know that one.",Ted
"Okay, how about this? I will tell you my most humiliating story.",Victoria
"Yeah, Victoria, way to step up!",Marshall
"Okay, it involves a game of truth or dare, a squeeze-bottle of marshmallow ice cream topping, and the hot tub at my grandparents' retirement community.",Victoria
That is the greatest story ever!,Marshall
Oh my God!,Lily
"Wow, wow!",Ted
"Victoria, I deem your offering... worthy. My saga... continues.",Barney
I went back to the coffeehouse to find Shannon.,Barney
Barney.,Shannon
"Sugar Bear, where were you?",Barney
"Oh, I'm sorry. My dad won't let me go.",Shannon
But the Nicaraguans need us!,Barney
"It's just, he's still supporting me, and... Look, he's coming by soon to talk about it, but I think you should go on without me.",Shannon
"Shannon, there is no...",Barney
"Barney, it's your dream. It's only two years. I know we can make it.",Shannon
"As I walked away, I realized Shannon was an adult. Her father couldn't control her life. I had to go back and confront him. She was in the middle of a heated argument with her dad.",Barney
Now we all got to drink.,Marshall
"Oh, my God. What happened next?",Ted
"I don't know, guys.",Barney
"Okay, okay. Marshall's mom sent us cookies...",Lily
"Lily, no!",Marshall
"For the team, Marshall, for the team.",Lily
"Hey, Mrs. Eriksen, it's Lily. Thank you so much for the delicious cookies. Mayonnaise. Really? Never would have guessed. Well, I will definitely give Marshall a kiss for you. Okay. Take care.",Lily
"Oh, crap. My mom sent cookies?",Marshall
"Yeah. I wish we had a dog, so they wouldn't go to waste.",Lily
So we've got the whole place to ourselves.,Marshall
I'm thinking floor sex.,Lily
Sounds reasonable.,Marshall
"Ooh, floor's cold. Grab that afghan your mom made.",Lily
The whole time?,Robin
The... whole... time.,Lily
"Barney, that was really embarrassing for both of us. We just earned a huge chunk of story.",Marshall
"Right. So where was I? Oh, yeah. Shannon was sucking face with her dad.",Barney
"How can... With your dad? I mean, I know judge not lest ye be judged, but gross!",Barney
"Barney, that's not my dad. His name's Greg. I've been seeing him for a few weeks. I was hoping you'd just leave, and we could avoid all this.",Shannon
We're breaking up? But what about the Peace Corps?,Barney
"Yeah, all this granola business, it was just a phase. Greg's older. He's successful. He buys me all this cool stuff.",Shannon
But I love you.,Barney
But he has a boat. You should go to the Peace Corps and forget about me.,Shannon
"I didn't go. That night, I recorded my video and mailed it to Shannon. I didn't see her until a week later. There's sugar in the basket. Shannon! Shannon, you came back!",Barney
I'm just picking up my last paycheck.,Shannon
Oh. Did you... did you get my tape?,Barney
"Oh, she got the tape.",Man
You? It was you?,Barney
"Will I ever see another rainbow Oh, man.",Man
"Oh, you poor thing.",Lily
The story's not over. I did see Shannon one more time.,Barney
When?,Robin
Sorry.,Marshall
You've got to tell us.,Lily
"I don't know, I think I might need one last story to get me through it.",Barney
Fine. Um... oh! The green testicle story. So I was playing ultimate frisbee in college and there was this barefoot dude with weirdly sharp toenails...,Ted
"Oh, come on, Ted! You know what story I want to hear. Everyone else here has manned up tonight and told the truth. Why can't you?",Barney
"You're right. Victoria, I'm sorry I haven't told you this yet, but a while back, I was kind of into Robin. In fact, on our first date, I might have said, I love you. Understandably, she freaked out and I left. But unfortunately, the night did not end there.",Ted
We all ended up at the bar with our cab driver Ranjit.,Ted
To one hell of a night!,Ranjit
"And I drank... a lot. So you guys think I should have kissed her? Well, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna go kiss her right... now.",Ted
Yes! Do it!,Barney
To the cab.,Ranjit
Hello? Is someone out there?,Robin
You ralphed and ran?,Lily
I thought you were vomit-free since '93. So that was a lie?,Marshall
You re-returned for me. That's really sweet. Though you kind of ruined my customized Scherbotsky doormat.,Robin
Sorry.,Ted
It's okay.,Robin
"Victoria, I know this must be...",Ted
Yeah. It kind of is.,Victoria
"Wow, Ted, you were right. You shouldn't have told that story. But you did earn yourself the right to the end of mine. We fast-forward eight years into the future.",Barney
"Wait, eight years, that's, that's this year.",Marshall
"Marshall, not only is it this year, it's tonight.",Barney
Hi.,Barney
Barney?,Shannon
"Hi, Shannon.",Barney
What are you doing here?,Shannon
"Just listen. When you left me for that guy Greg, it changed me. Now I'm this. I-I know this is crazy. It's just, you were once such a big part of my life. And it just seemed insane that you didn't know who I am now. So here I am. And then she told me about her life.",Barney
"She and Greg dated for a while and then split up. But here's the real kicker: Shannon's a mom. She has a little kid named Max. That's crazy. That could have been my kid. But instead, what do I have? My whole life's some money in the bank, some suits in my closet and a string of one-night stands.",Barney
"Hey. Come on. I mean, just because her life went one way and yours went another, it doesn't make your life any worse.",Lily
"My life rocks! Money, suits and sex. These are tears of joy! I could be cooped up in some tiny apartment changing some brat's poopy diapers. But instead, I'm out in the world being awesome 24-7, 365! You let me dodge a b*llet, Big Guy. Plus, here's the mini-cherry on top of the regular cherry on top of the sundae of awesomeness that is my life. After Shannon and I talked, I nailed her.",Barney
Nope.,Lily
Yeah.,Barney
Nope.,Lily
Yeah.,Barney
"Sorry. Don't buy it. You're making it up. You're just trying to cover the fact that you actually had a profound moment of doubt about yourself and... Oh, my God.",Lily
"Oh, Barney!",Shannon
"Video's pretty good on this phone, huh?",Barney
Is your phone on?,Shannon
"Oh, no. It just takes a while to power down.",Barney
"Ew, gross. Just stop it.",Lily
"Ladies, gentlemen... Ted. This has been a wonderful evening. I got great dirt on all you guys. I got Ted to tell the re-return. I finally nailed Shannon! Told her I'd call her tomorrow. Yeah, right. And I rediscovered just how awesomely awesome my life is. Peace out, hombres!",Barney
I think Barney just won game night.,Marshall
My first solo batch.,Ted
"Um, I think those need to stay in the oven a while longer. Here's a professional tip. If it's still runny, it's not a cupcake. It's a beverage.",Victoria
"Um, are you coloring in your butt?",Barney
"I have a big interview coming up, and my suit has holes in it. I can't sew, I don't own Navy boxers, so, yeah, I'm coloring in my butt.",Marshall
So wear another one.,Barney
I don't have another one. I'm flat broke. My only other suit options are track or birthday.,Marshall
"Dude, you show up to an interview in that, even the hippie lawyers from Granola Mountain Earth Pals will hackey sack you straight out the door.",Barney
"Okay, it's the National Resource Defense Council, and it's my dream job. Except it's only an internship, and I won't be getting paid. Mostly getting people coffee. But the people I'm getting coffee for... their bosses are going to save the world.",Marshall
"Okay, tomorrow... oh, and I should mention this is going to rock your world-- tomorrow I'm taking you to my personal tailor.",Barney
"A tailor? Barney, I make negative $300 a week, and I need every negative penny of that for my wedding.",Marshall
"Relax, my guy does everything for one third the cost. And there is no way you're getting married in that sarcastic-quotation-marks suit. Tomorrow, noon, my tailor.",Barney
"No thanks, dude. ",Marshall
Noon. See you then.,Barney
"Hey, girls.",Victoria
"Hey. I'm on my way to meet Ted. It's our two monthiversary, so we're going out to dinner.",Victoria
"Great! Well, that answers all the questions I didn't ask.",Robin
Robin!,Lily
"Oh, come on. We bust on each other. We're just at that place in our strong friendship.",Robin
Really? Oh.,Victoria
"Get off me. Oh, see? I did it again.",Robin
"What are you guys up to? Oh, dress shopping. You know, I make wedding cakes for a lot of fancy bridal shops. If you want, I could take you shopping, maybe get you a discount.",Victoria
Really? That'd be great.,Lily
Yeah. Huh. I should take this. Hello.,Victoria
"Hey, I thought it was going to be just us tomorrow. What's with inviting Punky Brewster?",Robin
"Robin, you've got to get over this Ted and Victoria thing. You had your chance, and now he's moved on. Can't you just be happy for them?",Lily
The best I can give you is a fake smile and dead eyes.,Robin
"Sold. Victoria, what's wrong?",Lily
I've just been offered a fellowship at a culinary institute in Germany.,Victoria
"Wait. Germany, Europe?",Ted
"It's for two years. I figured I didn't have much of a chance, 'cause they don't let many Americans in, but... I'm in.",Victoria
"So, this is the Europe Germany?",Ted
What other Germany would it be?,Victoria
The one in Epcot?,Ted
Ted.,Victoria
Sorry. Congratulations.,Ted
Thank you. I don't know if I'm going to go.,Victoria
"Mm-hmm. And if you do, what does that mean for us?",Ted
I don't know. I just... I don't think that long distance really works for anyone.,Victoria
"Oh, God, no. Long-distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.",Ted
"So, that leaves us with...",Victoria
"Either you stay here, or we break up. Wow. Um, look, let's just see how things progress, and if by September, we still feel...",Ted
I have to leave on Monday.,Victoria
"Monday, September the...?",Ted
Ted. Do you have any thoughts?,Victoria
Maybe we should each take some time to think about what we want. We'll meet up tomorrow to discuss it.,Ted
It's a date.,Victoria
"Hey, baby, how's the dress place?",Marshall
Everything's so fluffy and white. It's like shopping in a marshmallow. How's Barney's tailor?,Lily
"Um, everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.",Marshall
"Well, good luck, baby.",Lily
"Bye. Hey, Barney, I'm not sure about this. A tailor in the back room of a pet store?",Marshall
"Look, do you want a quality suit and a free rabbit or not? Ted, Sergei says stop moping around. You're distracting him from his process.",Barney
You speak Ukrainian?,Marshall
"Guys, I'm kind of screwed here. I don't want to lose Victoria, but I can't ask her to stay just for me. And long distance definitely isn't an option.",Ted
"No. No, no, no. No way. You know who likes long distance? Girls. It's all talking and no sex. k*ll me now.",Marshall
Don't knock long-distance relationships. I really think they can work.,Barney
Really? You?,Ted
"Absolutely. I'm juggling four right now. There's Lisa in Madrid, there's Erica in Tokyo, there's Laura in Denmark, and Kelly on 34th Street. The lass thinks I'm a humble sheep shearer from k*ll.",Barney
"Ted, do you remember in college when Lily did that summer art program in Paris?",Marshall
Yeah.,Ted
"Well, she kept talking about this cheesy French guy, Gabriel. So, I went out to visit, and there was this party. And who shows up but Gabriel. And he's got this weak-ass, thin French moustache. I'm not much of a fighter, but I knew I could take this weird little dude. So, I took him aside, and I got all creepy quiet, I got the crazy eyes going, and I said, You stay away from Lily, or I swear to God I'll eat that moustache right off of your ugly French face. Yeah. Yeah, he literally ran away. I think he was crying. I never told Lily about it. To be honest, I'm not very proud of it. To be even more honest, I am.",Marshall
"Um, other than confirming a lot of European stereotypes about Americans, did that little story have a point?",Ted
"Yeah, the point is that even though Lily is my soul mate, long distance still almost k*ll us. If you think that there's any chance that Victoria is your soul mate, you should ask her to stay.",Marshall
"Well, I don't know if she is. It's still so early, but yeah, she could be.",Ted
"Oh, please. You barely know this girl. What's her favorite color? Is she a cat person or a dog person? Is she open to a three-way? Ted, I do more research than this before buying a cell phone. FYI, yes, I have three-way calling.",Marshall
"Look, she can't be a cat person. I'm a dog person, I'm attracted to other dog people.",Ted
Are you sure?,Barney
All right. (,Ted
Hello.,Victoria
"Hey, random question. How do you feel about cats?",Ted
"Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.",Victoria
"Good to know. Um, okay. Good-bye. ",Ted
"Oh, excellent. We'll take this one.",Barney
"Whoa. Hey, hey, it's my suit. Shouldn't I be the one to choose?",Marshall
Here. Play with this pin cushion.,Barney
God. I'm going to look hot.,Marshall
"Marshall, I can't let you waste a suit this nice fighting a losing battle for our planet's survival. This is a suit for winners. I am getting you an interview at my office. We need good men like you in our legal department. We get sued a lot.",Barney
No way. The Kid does not sell out.,Marshall
"Oh, come on, dude! Three months working with me, you'll make more than Lily makes in a year.",Barney
No. I've made my decision.,Marshall
"So have I. If I ask this girl to give up her dreams for me, and two weeks later, it's not working out, I'm, like, the biggest jerk of all time. It's just too much pressure on a new relationship. I'm going to tell her to go.",Ted
"All right, I've been thinking a lot about this... Okay, wait, before you say anything, I wanted to give you this. This is what happens when you, you know, let them finish baking.",Victoria
I want you to stay.,Ted
Everything here is dark and sketchy and seems illegal. It's like shopping in Barney's mind.,Marshall
"Oh, good luck, baby.",Lily
Bye.,Marshall
"Now, what sort of dress did you have in mind, dear?",Woman
Nothing too huge or-or poofy. I'm not really a girlie girl. But I would like to look like a beautiful princess.,Lily
I saw a couple up front that were nice.,Robin
Where does she get off? She doesn't know how much money I make.,Lily
"Oh, these women are experts. They can guess your net annual income just by looking at your underwear.",Victoria
Damn you Old Navy and your reasonably-priced three-packs!,Lily
At least we get free champagne!,Victoria
And cake.,Robin
Mm-hmm.,Victoria
"Speaking of which, Victoria, have you decided what to do about your doughnut fellowship?",Robin
"You know, I don't know. I mean, I want to go, but I don't want to lose Ted. I even thought about long distance, as if that ever works.",Victoria
Ugh. All talking and no sex. k*ll me now.,Lily
"I know it sounds lame, but I actually think that Ted might be The One. That's pretty hard to walk away from.",Victoria
"Well, I don't know. I'd feel a little Stepford turning down a huge opportunity to chase some guy I'd only known two months.",Robin
But this isn't just some guy. This is Ted. He's amazing. He's the best guy I know.,Victoria
"Yeah, in America, but German guys? Whew! I would let them bread my schnitzel any day, if you know what I mean.",Robin
I really don't...,Victoria
"Sex. Oh, excuse me, ma'am. This bastard's kicked.",Robin
Thanks.,Woman
"It's okay, guys, I hate it.",Lily
Just horrible.,Victoria
"It's bad, it's really bad. Short in front, long in the back? That is the mullet of wedding dresses.",Robin
"You know, Victoria, Marshall and I did long distance once. In college, I did an art course in Paris. I was the only American there. It was really lonely. I only had one friend, Gabrielle. She was kind of homely and strange-looking, and she was really self-conscious about this little moustache she had. Anyway, halfway through the semester, she just stopped talking to me, and I never figured out why. And then I had nobody. The only thing that got me through was knowing that my soul mate was back at home waiting for me. If Ted's your soul mate, then it may be worth it to hang onto him.",Lily
But how am I supposed to know if we're soul mates? It's too soon. Ooh. Speak of the devil. Hello.,Victoria
"Hey, random question: how do you feel cats?",Ted
"Cats. Hated the musical, love the animal.",Victoria
A cat person. Why am I not surprised?,Robin
Bye. Why does Ted want to know if I like cats?,Victoria
Maybe he's going to buy you one.,Lily
I did hear barking in the background. Maybe he was in a pet store. Does he want us to get a cat together?,Victoria
Maybe he's using an adorable kitty to guilt you into staying.,Robin
That is low. Do you really think that's what he's doing?,Victoria
"Oh, I wouldn't even wait to find out. I would be on the next plane to Germany.",Robin
"Oh, God, you guys are sucky liars.",Lily
"Ugly, ugly, ugly.",Robin
"I don't know what to say. You know what? We're doing this all wrong. I am going to get you one of those front window dresses, just for fun.",Victoria
Are you okay?,Lily
I'm fine.,Robin
Okay. Just kind of seemed like you're trying to hustle Victoria out of the country.,Lily
"I'm not, I'm just trying to support her. She got a super-important dessert scholarship.",Robin
"Stop being sarcastic. It is a super-important dessert scholarship. Wow, that's hard to say without sounding sarcastic. Look... I know you're not Victoria's biggest fan, but she seems to make Ted happy. So think about that before you use your miles to buy her a plane ticket.",Lily
Somebody say beautiful princess.,Victoria
"Oh, my gosh, it's perfect! Oh! This dress is totally going to get me laid on my wedding night.",Lily
"Oh, look how happy she is. You know, I've always thought of myself as one of those independent women who would never let any guy mess with my career. And now I'm actually thinking about it. I feel guilty, like it's un-feminist or something.",Victoria
I know what you mean.,Robin
You do?,Victoria
"Well, I'm always putting my career ahead of my relationships, and... to be honest, there's a lot of lonely nights in that job description.",Lily
"See, that's what I'm afraid of.",Victoria
Choosing Ted over your career doesn't make you un-feminist. Maybe it just means that you guys would be happy together.,Robin
Robin... I think that you are the coolest. I'm so glad that we're friends.,Victoria
"Oh, no way... you're the coolest.",Robin
"No, you are.",Victoria
"Okay, I am.",Robin
I'm going to stay.,Victoria
"Oh, I am so beautiful! Oh, don't tell me how much it costs. Just snap my neck now, so I can die this pretty.",Lily
"Wow, you look incredible.",Robin
"Oh. Okay, okay, how much is it, on a scale of never to never ever?",Lily
"Never ever, ever, ever, ever... times infinity.",Robin
"Well, it's okay. You know, what makes a bride beautiful is that she's just happy to be getting married. ",Lily
"Yes, you're right. But also... you just sat down in the cake.",Robin
"But, you know what? It's going to come out because it's only... chocolate and raspberry.",Victoria
"Okay. Come on, get up, let us see how bad it is.",Robin
It was like this when I found it?,Lily
And how will you be paying for this?,Woman
Credit card... s.,Lily
"I wanted to give you... this. This is what happens when you... you know, let them finish baking.",Victoria
I want you to stay.,Ted
I have to go to Germany.,Victoria
You're going?,Ted
Yes. I have to.,Victoria
So that's what you decided?,Ted
"Well, no... I mean, I actually came here tonight leaning toward staying, but when you just told me to stay, it made me realize that I have to go.",Victoria
"What is this, opposite day or something?",Ted
No.,Victoria
So it is?,Ted
"Ted, we've only been dating for two months. I can't let you make this decision for me.",Victoria
"I was totally going to tell you to go, but then you gave me this cupcake, and it reminded me how great you are.",Ted
"Well, is there any chance that you would move to Germany with me?",Victoria
"Well, that's just crazy.",Ted
"Oh, okay. So it's fine for me to make sacrifices for you, but for you it's crazy.",Victoria
But you have a job here and a life; I'd have nothing there.,Ted
You'd have me.,Victoria
"We've only been dating two months. Oh, it's not fair. It's not fair that we have to break up. I hate this.",Ted
So... we're breaking up?,Victoria
I guess so. I guess so.,Ted
"God, that sucks, man. I'm so sorry.",Marshall
"It was just too much pressure too soon. I mean, maybe it was silly to even think... Yes, Marshall, I see your new suit, and it's awesome.",Ted
"Well, thank you for acknowledging it. It was weird that you hadn't. Look, I understand that you guys had to break up eventually, but why today?",Marshall
She's leaving tomorrow.,Ted
"Yeah, but she's still in town.",Marshall
"Yeah, she... she's still in town.",Ted
"Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together. Ted, think about it this way: if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow, would you sit on the couch and cry about it, or would you run, and jump, and do some awesome air kicks while you still could?",Marshall
"Awesome air kicks, huh?",Ted
New pajama bottoms?,Marshall
You know it.,Ted
"So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.",Ted
"Wait, so we're sharing the leg?",Victoria
"No, the leg is a metaphor.",Ted
"How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day, and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next? I don't know, Ted.",Victoria
"Come on, we've had a good run. Why end on a fight?",Ted
"Well, what would you want to do?",Victoria
Let's do all the stuff we talked about doing and never got around to.,Ted
Like go to the Mets.,Victoria
"Yeah, we'll walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.",Ted
See some monkeys at the zoo?,Victoria
Go to that French-Vietnamese place we keep passing and say we want to try?,Ted
Wow! We better get going.,Victoria
"Yeah, big day.",Ted
Yeah.,Victoria
"Lily, you have to tell him. That dress cost a fortune.",Robin
"No, I'm just gonna wait for the next time Marshall really screws up, and then, I'll just slip this in, and it won't seem so bad by comparison.",Lily
"Well, here's hoping he cheats on you.",Robin
"Yeah, but only, like, second base.",Lily
"Look at us: two guys in suits. You feel that slight tingle? That's every girl in the bar wanting you, and every guy wanting to be you. Actually, it's mostly me, but you're getting some of the splash.",Barney
"Hey, babe. Dollar beer night, so I splurged and got us each our own.",Marshall
"So, have you thought more about coming to work for Barney Corp?",Barney
"Oh, please... your company is not called Barney Corp.",Marshall
"Yet. Oh, I almost forgot. Sergei sent me your bill.",Barney
"B... Barney, this says $4,000. I thought you said that it was one-third price.",Marshall
"Yeah, must be a $12,000 suit. Oh, well, guess you'll have to come work at my company.",Barney
You set this up! You set this whole thing up!,Marshall
I most certainly did...,Barney
"Well, it won't work. Even if I have to get two extra night jobs, I'll pay your precious tailor. I'm not selling my soul. Baby, I know that this will make things harder, but I will make it work, I promise.",Marshall
"I destroyed an $8,000 wedding dress.",Lily
What time is the interview?,Marshall
"9:00 a.m., and you'll need new shoes. Don't worry, I know a guy.",Barney
I'm glad we got to spent the day doing awesome air kicks.,Victoria
"Yeah, I was almost too tired for all the sex.",Ted
I'm going to miss you so much.,Victoria
"I'm going to miss you, too.",Ted
"Hey, you know, I mean, if, when I get back, we're still single, we can...",Victoria
Even if we're not.,Ted
Okay.,Victoria
"Look, I know it never works for anyone, but... do you want to try long distance?",Ted
Yes. Yes!,Victoria
We can b*at the odds.,Ted
"Odds, schmodds.",Victoria
It's gonna work. We're going to make it work-- it'll work.,Ted
What advice do you have for a budding anthropologist?,Marshall
"Yep. When I grow up, I want to go live with the gorillas, just like you did.",Marshall
"...and if economic sanctions and trade restrictions aren't enforced, the destruction of the rainforests will continue and over a million species will be wiped out.",Marshall
So you don't want coffee.,Ted
I'm saying that the coffee industry is causing irreversible...,Marshall
All right. I'm pouring it out.,Ted
"Okay, one cup. The kid needs to be alert. First day on the job and everything.",Marshall
I still can't believe you're going all corporate on us. The kid has become the man.,Ted
"Okay, it's just an internship to make a little money. After law school, I'm going to work for the NRDC. They're gonna stop global warming.",Marshall
Here's your sack lunch.,Lily
"Okay, I love you because, one, you made me a sack lunch and two, you laugh every time you say the word sack.",Marshall
"I love you, Marshmallow.",Lily
I love you.,Marshall
"I love you too, Marshmallow.",Ted
Uh-oh. Ted?,Marshall
"Oh, no. No, she didn't.",Ted
"Yeah. Yeah, she did.",Marshall
Another care package?,Ted
How many is that so far?,Marshall
Three.,Ted
And how many have you sent her?,Lily
"In the mail or in my mind? Zero. She's up three-zip. Oh! Cupcakes! Great. I bet they're delicious, too. Yup, they're delicious. Damn it! I don't deserve these delicious cupcakes. God, I hate myself right now.",Ted
"God, that is so me at 15.",Marshall
Go for Barney.,Barney
"Mr. Stinson, this is Willis from lobby security. Sorry to bother you, but we've had reports of a sasquatch loose in the building.",Voice
A sasquatch?,Barney
"That's right, sir, a Bigfoot. We don't want to alarm you, but he's been spotted on your floor.",Voice
Yes! Look at you. You suited in an unmistakably upward direction.,Barney
Whoa. That is a butt-load of motivational posters.,Marshall
"Yeah, hell, yeah. I got 'em all: Teamwork, Courage, Awesomeness...",Barney
There's one for awesomeness?,Marshall
"Yeah, I had it made. Sit.",Barney
"Hey, so, now that I'm working here, are you finally going to tell me exactly what your job is?",Marshall
Please.,Barney
"Hey, Blauman, Bilson, this is Marshall. These guys are in legal. You're gonna be working with them.",Barney
Marshall Eriksen. Nice to meet you.,Marshall
Nice tie. Steak sauce.,Bilson
"Oh, steak sauce! For true, though.",Blauman
"Where, I don't, I don't see...",Marshall
Marshall? Sidebar. Your tie is steak sauce. It means A-1. A-1? Get it? Try to keep up.,Barney
"Okay, Eriksen, let's get to work. It's 2:00 a.m. It's raining outside. Ding dong! What? The doorbell? Oh, hello, Jessica Alba in a trench coat and nothing else. But wait-- knock, knock. Somebody's at the back door?",Bilson
I don't have a back door.,Marshall
"Oh, my gosh, Jessica Simpson? What a surprise. Two Jessicas, you gotta pick one. What do you do? Go.",Bilson
"Right. Well, uh... I'm engaged, so--",Marshall
Fiancee's out of town. What do you do? Go.,Bilson
"We're still engaged, even if she's...",Marshall
"Okay, fiancee's dead. Hit by a bus. What do you do? Go.",Bilson
Sure you don't want one?,Ted
How many of those have you eaten?,Robin
"Four. Teen. No, just four. And the icing from two more. So, anyway, here's the problem.",Ted
"Hey, it's Ted. I guess you're asleep. Anyway, I got the care package, and it's just great. Here, listen... Mmm. Mmm!",Ted
"So I'm standing there, my mouth full of this delicious relationship-winning cupcake... And... I said something dumb.",Ted
"Oh, and, um... don't worry, yours is in the mail. I sent it a couple days ago. And it's awesome. Really, really awesome.",Ted
Why did I say that? I think frosting makes me lie.,Ted
"Oh, Teddy boy.",Robin
"Yeah. So now, whatever I send her, she'll know I sent it after I talked to her. So that's the problem. You work on that. I'm gonna eat this cupcake.",Ted
"All right, here's what you do: Put together a care package of stuff from New York-- some H&amp;H bagels, an Empire State Building keychain... and then, top off the package with a New York Times... Ready? From three days ago.",Robin
"That's brilliant. You're brilliant. You know, it's funny, not so long ago, I was coming to Marshall and Lily for advice on how to impress you.",Ted
That is funny.,Robin
"Okay, fine, I have feelings for him.",Robin
"Now it's ironic, the girl I used to like is helping me impress the girl I now like.",Ted
"The irony is clear, Ted.",Robin
Hey! How was your first day?,Lily
I don't wanna talk about it. The guys I work with are a bunch of jerks.,Marshall
What?,Lily
They're jerks!,Marshall
What makes them jerks?,Lily
"Forget it, I don't want to talk about it. Well, like today at lunch..",Marshall
"What do you got there, Ericksen? Mommy pack your lunch?",Bilson
"For your information, my fiancee did.",Marshall
"Oh... Does she cut the crusts off your sandwich, too?",Blauman
No.,Marshall
What's that?,Blauman
Nothing. Give it.,Marshall
Dear Marshmallow. Good luck today. I love you. Lilypad.,Bilson
Give it.,Marshall
"P.S. If you've unfolded this note, your kiss already got out. Quick-- catch it.",Bilson
"Give it back. Hey, give it. Gimme... Give it!",Marshall
"Oh, screw those guys! We're adorable.",Lily
"I know. God. It's like freshman year all over again. Only this time, my sweet dance moves aren't going to be enough to win them over. Not even Old Reliable.",Marshall
"Sweetie... It would be cool to have some extra money, but, but, if you're unhappy, it's not worth it.",Lily
I quit.,Marshall
"What? No. We're having so much fun. You, me, working together. It's great.",Barney
"We're not even working together, Barney. I'm in the legal department and you're... Seriously, what is it that you do?",Marshall
Please.,Barney
"I'm sorry, dude, this corporate thing, it's just... it's not for me.",Marshall
"Oh, of course it's not for you. It's for Lily.",Barney
What?,Marshall
Marshall. Lily's a catch. But do you really think you're going to hang onto a girl that great without the package?,Barney
The package?,Marshall
The package. The house. The car. Sending your kids to a great school. A vacation once in a while.,Barney
Lily doesn't care about that stuff.,Marshall
"Well, no-- now she doesn't, but how's she going to feel in a couple years, when she's supporting you on a kindergarten teacher's salary while you're off in court defending some... endangered... South American... flying beaver.",Barney
She'll be happy.,Marshall
Okay. But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier.,Barney
And all four are totally naked. You gotta choose one. What do you do? Go.,Bilson
"I guess, uh... Bea Arthur.",Marshall
"Ahh! Wrong! Betty White. Clean this stuff up, Eriksen.",Bilson
"So, did she get the awesome care package yet?",Robin
Yep. Yesterday.,Ted
Did she love it?,Robin
"Ooh, she loved it.",Ted
So what's the problem?,Robin
"So I was talking to her last night. And, I should tell you, we've been talking on the phone every other night for, like, an hour and a half. Eventually you just run out of stuff to say.",Ted
What did you have for lunch today? Oh. Rye bread. Yeah.,Ted
"Oh, Teddy boy.",Robin
"I'm usually so good at being a boyfriend, but this never-seeing-each-other thing, it's a bitch. Maybe it just can't be do. I think it's clear what I have to do.",Ted
It's pretty clear.,Robin
I have to go to Germany and surprise her.,Ted
"Totally what I was thinking. Get out of my head, man!",Robin
"Barney, how do I get these idiots to leave me alone?",Marshall
"Marshall, consider the penguins.",Barney
The penguins?,Marshall
On the wall.,Barney
Conformity. It's the one who's different that gets left out in the cold. This is a motivational poster?,Marshall
"Look at yourself, Marshall. You're not happy. And you know why? Because you're different. Now, I suppose you could learn to love yourself for the unique little snowflake that you are, or... you could change your entire personality, which is just so much easier.",Barney
"Change your personality? That is so awful, and not at all motivational.",Lily
"Not necessarily. Okay, at first, I was appalled, but then I realized it's just like Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-Vasquez in Life Among the Gorillas. I have to gain the acceptance of the herd by behaving exactly like one of them. It's an anthropological study. Isn't that cool?",Marshall
It sounds kinda like peer pressure.,Lily
"No, no, no. It's totally anthropological and it's cool and I'm doing it.",Marshall
"Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's peer pressure. We have an assembly every year.",Lily
I'm portraying someone who succumbs to peer pressure.,Marshall
"All right, but if those guys try to pressure you to smoke, what do you say?",Lily
Only when I'm drunk.,Marshall
Good boy.,Lily
"Okay, I'm psyched about this. But if I'm going to mentor you, I need to know you're psyched about this, too.",Barney
"Oh, I am. I'm, I'm psyched.",Marshall
"Yeah, but it's one thing to say it, it's another thing to show it. Show it.",Barney
I'm psyched!,Marshall
"What was that? Marshall, I should feel tremors of psychitude rock my body like a seizure. That was like a declawed pregnant cat on a porch swing idly swatting at a fly on a lazy Sunday afternoon.",Barney
"Wow, that was really specific.",Marshall
Show me you're psyched! Let's do this! Ow! That hurt!,Barney
So badly.,Marshall
And then you slip it to the guy with a discreet handshake and he'll get it done.,Barney
Right. Get what done?,Marshall
Whatever.,Barney
Cool. And what guy is this?,Marshall
There's always a guy.,Barney
"Okay, all right, I, uh, I think I'm ready.",Marshall
You sure? You want to practice your story one more time?,Barney
"All right. So dude, check it. I'm in San Diego with two of my bro-sephs from Kappa, and they're all, Yo, Eriksen, let's roll to the strip clubs. So I'm, like, Snapadoo! So we find this choice nudie nest near the airport......and that is when the bouncer kicked us out. Now, I have no idea if Svetlana ever got her green card, but dudes, fake diamond ring? Worth every penny, bruh.",Marshall
Eriksen...that was steak sauce!,Blauman
Great story.,Bilson
Uh-oh.,Ted
"So she's going to dump me. Has anyone ever said, Listen, I've been thinking, and then follow it up with something good? It's not like: Listen, I've been thinking, Nutter-Butters are an underrated cookie. What else can it be? What could she possibly have to say to me that she couldn't write in an e-mail?",Ted
"I cut off all my fingers? Ted, you're a great guy. I know it, you know it, she knows it. I would bet you a gazillion dollars-- no, I'm even more confident. I would bet you a floppity jillion dollars that she's not calling to break up with you.",Robin
"Thanks. You're right. I'm being crazy. So I should still buy that plane ticket, right?",Ted
I'd wait.,Robin
"'Sup, Blauman? b*mb here. We still on for karaoke? Dope. I'm going to rock you on the mike so hard your hears are going to bleed gravy. Catch you on the flip, butt puppet.",Marshall
Okay...what do you think?,Lily
Steak sauce.,Marshall
Steak sauce?,Lily
Yeah.,Marshall
"Look, you know, whatever anthropology you do at work is your business, but please don't act like that around here.",Lily
"Lily, when Dr. Aurelia Birnholz-...",Marshall
"No, when Dr. Australia Birdbath-Vaseline came home from the gorillas, she didn't run around picking nits out of people's hair and-and throwing feces. I'm begging you just, just leave it at the office.",Lily
Why?,Marshall
"Because you're acting like one of those guys, and those guys are lame.",Lily
"Okay, those guys were mean at first, yes, but they're actually good guys, and if you got to know them, then you would see that. Come karaoke with us tonight, and you'll see how totally not that lame they are, okay?",Marshall
Okay.,Lily
"But wait, knock-knock, back door, who's there? Angelina Jolie... wait, in a wheelchair. What do you do? Go.",Blauman
"Dude, Scarlett Johannsen with no arms, any day of the week. Yeah.",Bilson
You're right. They're delightful.,Lily
"So, Barney, you gonna sing anything?",Marshall
Nah. I'm so over karaoke.,Barney
Really? I thought you'd be totally into it.,Marshall
"Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm good. The best, really. But it's the greatest samurai who lets his sword rust in its scabbard.",Barney
"Oh, baby, they have our song. Let's do Don't Go Breaking My Heart.",Lily
What?,Bilson
"Don't Go Breaking My Heart. Elton John, Kiki Dee.",Marshall
No way. You got to go with some Black Sabbath.,Bilson
"Well, actually, Marshall and I have this little dance routine.",Lily
Iron Man. I could do Iron Man.,Marshall
Steak sauce.,Blauman
"Steak sauce, dude.",Bilson
"Should we tell him? All right, Eriksen, I've got some good news. On Monday, Bilson and I are going to talk to Montague in HR. When you graduate, we want you working with us. What do you say? Yes!",Blauman
That's my man!,Bilson
"I told you he would. Aw, we're gonna own the office.",Blauman
"Okay, that was gross. When were you going to tell me you changed your entire career path?",Lily
"Nothing has changed, okay? I still want to help the environment. I just thought that maybe I could make some money for a few years. We could buy an apartment, send our kids to good schools. You could quit your job and focus on your painting. I know that you say you don't need it, but... I love you and I want to give it to you anyway. I want to give you the package.",Marshall
"The package?! You've already given me the package. You've got a great package, Marshall. I love your package.",Lily
"Lily, you're the most incredible woman I know, and you deserve a big package.",Marshall
"Your package has always been big enough. You may not realize this, Marshall Eriksen, but you've got a huge package.",Lily
Hello.,Robin
Why hasn't she called yet?,Ted
"Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.",Robin
"No, what's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.",Ted
"I'm flattered you think we have two viewers. She's not going to break up with you, Ted. You're awesome.",Robin
"Thanks. Anyway, it's almost 11:00. I should let you go. Break a leg.",Ted
I'm actually sitting at home waiting for the phone to ring.,Ted
Marshall.,Ted
"Hey, hey.",Marshall
"Dude, I feel like I haven't seen you in a month.",Ted
Yeah. Yeah. How you doing?,Marshall
I think Victoria's about to break up with me.,Ted
"Oh, God, I'm sorry, man.",Marshall
"Yeah, well, honestly, I'm having trouble remembering what she looks like. The more I try to picture her, the more I can't. Like, I remember how she makes me feel. I just... I don't completely remember her. It's like I'm trying to preserve something that's already gone.",Ted
Preserving something that's already gone. Sounds like environmental law.,Marshall
"I don't know. We struggle so hard to hold onto these things that we know are going to disappear eventually. And that's really noble, but even if you save every rainforest from being turned into a parking lot, well, then where are you going to park your car?",Ted
*Don't go breakin' my heart*,Marshall
*I couldn't if I tried*,Lily
"*Honey, if I get restless*",Marshall
"*Baby, you're not that kind...*",Lily
Hello.,Ted
"Hi, Ted. It's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but, uh, do you want to come over?",Robin
She was completely amazing. She was amazing and funny and...,Ted
You have feelings for Ted.,Lily
Maybe.,Robin
I've just been offered a fellowhip at a culinary institute in Germany.,Victoria
Do you want to try long distance?,Ted
Yes.,Victoria
"This long-distance thing sucks, huh? And I really need to talk to you tonight.",Robin
She's going to dump me!,Ted
"She's not going to break up with you, Ted.",Robin
Hello?,Ted
Do you want to come over?,Robin
Hello.,Ted
"Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over?",Robin
"Sit. Good boys. Okay, remember, stay out of the liquor cabinet. I'll see you tonight.",Robin
"And so the life of a television reporter is very rewarding, and I stronly urge you to consider it as a career. Thank you. Yeah?",Robin
Marshall was here yesterday. They just learned the word fianc√©.,Lily
"Oh, no, I don't have a fianc√©.",Robin
"Well, actually, I've got five dogs.",Robin
"No, I've got five dogs.",Robin
"Well, yeah, that's cats. I'm not some pathetic cat lady. Not that your grandmother is...",Robin
Does anyone else have a...? Yes?,Robin
No. Are you? Just because a woman lives alone doesn't mean she's a les...,Robin
"Okay, let's have a big hand for Robin the reporter. All right, our next guest is another friend...",Lily
"So, Robin, you ever report on train wrecks? 'Cause I just saw one. What up? Tiny five.",Barney
"Ha-ha. Laugh now, those kids are monsters. They're going to eat you alive.",Robin
He has a job doing... What do you do?,Lily
"Please. Kids, let's rap. You guys don't give half a brown Crayola what I do for a living, do you?",Barney
No.,All
No. I know what you want. Magic.,Barney
Hello.,Robin
Why hasn't she called yet?,Ted
"Okay, you're making yourself crazy. It's Saturday night. Go out and do something.",Robin
"What's the point of going out? I got a girlfriend... for now. Besides, if I go out, who's going to watch the news? I'm, like, half your viewership.",Ted
I'm flattered you think we have two viewers.,Robin
And we're clear.,Director
"So, Scherbotsky, got a boyfriend?",Man
"No, and why does this keep coming up today?",Robin
"Oh, I just thought that guy you were on the phone with...",Man
"What? Oh, no, that was Ted. He's just a friend. I mean, there was this moment where we almost dated, but we want completely different things. Anyway, now he has this girlfriend in Germany and he thinks she's calling to dump him tonight, but I don't think she is. And besides, we want completely different things.",Robin
We should have sex.,Man
What?,Robin
"Why not? We're both available, we're both attractive, we're both good at it. At least, I'm good at it. And even if you're not, don't worry, I'll have a good time either way.",Man
"Well, moving past the horrifying image of your hair helmet clanging against the headboard, don't get involved with people I work with.",Robin
"Get involved? Who said get involved? I'm just saying we should have sex, it could be fun.",Man
Home number. Call me anytime. A lot of local teens in action tonight...,Man
"Hey, guys. Miss me? I missed you, too. Hi, Ted, it's Robin. Um, listen, I know it's late, but do you want to come over? Ted?",Robin
"Uh, yeah... Uh, hi, I'm here.",Ted
Do you want to come over?,Robin
Why? What's up?,Ted
"Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like, You know who likes juice? Ted.",Robin
I love juice.,Ted
Great. So you want to come over and make juice?,Robin
"Okay, sure. I'll come over. We'll... juice.",Ted
"Yes, we'll juice.",Robin
Okay.,Ted
Okay... bye.,Robin
Bye.,Ted
This is fine. This is totally fine.,Ted
"Oh, I'm, uh, going over to this girl's house to make some juice.",Ted
"No, it's not like that. We're juicing as friends. See, I have this girlfriend, I would never cheat on her. She lives in Germany. See, she was supposed to call me four hours ago to have a serious talk. I still haven't heard from her. I don't know. Sorry to bug you with my problems. Guess cab drivers are the new bartenders, huh?",Ted
You can just let me out right up here.,Ted
"Park Slope, Eighth and Eighth. Okay, here's where I left off with the last guy. See, I have a girlfriend, but I'm going over to this other girl's house...",Ted
"And you're wondering if I'd be upset. Hi, Ted. Remember me, your girlfriend?",Victoria
"Okay, relax, Robin's just a friend.",Ted
Right. You're going to go make some juice.,Victoria
"Yes, yes! Juice is perfectly harmless. In fact, it's healthy.",Ted
"Oh, yeah? Then why are you wondering what she looks like naked?",Victoria
"I am not won... Okay, even if I am wondering that, it's only 'cause you put it in my head.",Ted
"Ah, but I'm just a manifestation of your subconscious, so actually, you put it in your own head.",Victoria
Damn it! Nothing's going to happen.,Ted
Right.,Victoria
"Okay, okay. You want a second opinion? Fine.",Ted
"Hey, did she call?",Marshall
"No. I need a ruling. Um, I'm... Yeah, this is stupid. It's not even a big deal, but I'm on my way over to Robin's right now. She got a new juicer. Whatever. We're going to test it out.",Ted
"Let me call you back. Honey, there's a situation developing. Do you remember the huge secret that you told me that you weren't supposed to but you did? The thing... about Robin?",Marshall
"Oh, you mean how Robin's in love with Ted?",Barney
"Yeah, she told me already. Go on.",Barney
Wait. So I'm the only one that she didn't tell? She told you and not me?,Marshall
"Well, I guess I'm just better friends with her than you are.",Barney
"Well, I'm better friends with Ted than you are.",Marshall
That is a lie!,Barney
It is not a lie.,Marshall
"Okay, that's it! You and me! I'm not afraid of you!",Barney
I'll show you things you never seen before! I used to box in the Army!,Marshall
"Come on, pick up. Damn it, Victoria, where are you? Pick up, pick up!",Ted
Cupcake?,Victoria
"No, thanks. Where are you? Why haven't you called?",Ted
"Oh, I'm out hooking up... with three other guys. Or maybe I'm a devoted girlfriend and I'm calling you right now.",Victoria
Yeah. Why do I doubt that? Hello.,Ted
"Ted, I just saw the news and a truck carrying sulphuric acid overturned right in front of Robin's house. And it's melting through the sidewalk. You can see straight down into hell. It's bad. You should go home, dude.",Marshall
"Marshall, it's fine. Nothing's going to happen.",Ted
"Ted, what does your mom always say?",Marshall
Nothing good ever...,Ted
Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m. Go home! It's too late for juice.,Marshall
"Dude, Robin and I are just friends. She doesn't even like me that way.",Ted
"Yes, she does! She likes you. She told me.",Lily
What?,Ted
"It's a big secret, so don't tell her I told you, but she's very vulnerable right now and you have a girlfriend. Go home, Ted.",Lily
She-she likes me?,Ted
"Yes. So you see why it would be a very bad idea for you to go up there. Go home, Ted.",Lily
She likes me?,Ted
"Go home, Ted.",Lily
"Uh, you're right. I'll, uh, I'll see you at home.",Ted
Good. He's going home.,Lily
He is so not going home. I cannot believe you just told him that.,Marshall
What do you mean?,Lily
"Lily, here's what you just said: Ted, whatever you do, don't go up there. There's a beautiful girl who wants to have sex with you. And then she's gonna make you some delicious juice.",Marshall
"No, he's not going up there. He has more sense than that.",Lily
Keep the change.,Ted
So you're doing this? You're going up there?,Victoria
You want to get out of the way?,Ted
I'm not in the way.,Victoria
"You know, if you had just called me, I...",Ted
Hi.,Robin
"Hi. Um, I got some vegetables. I got carrots, I got beets.",Ted
Or we could just drink wine.,Robin
"Wine... not? Well, that's the stupidest thing I've ever said.",Ted
Thanks.,Robin
Make it a big glass.,Ted
Sure.,Robin
"So, how's it hanging?",Ted
Have you ever had one of those days where nothing at all that monumental happens but by the end of it you have no idea who you are anymore or what the hell you're doing with your life? Do you ever have one of those days?,Robin
"Uh, about once a week.",Ted
"I don't know, it was just a, a rough day and the only person I wanted to see at the end of it was you. So... um... how was the big phone call with your girlfriend?",Robin
We broke up.,Ted
What?,Robin
"Yeah. Yeah, she finally called. We talked for a while-- how hard long distance is-- and then... she dumped me.",Ted
"Oh, Ted, I'm so sorry. That's just terrible. I feel awful.",Robin
You're smiling.,Ted
"Am I? No I'm not. I'm a news anchor. Smiling's a part of the job. Thousands died in a tragic avalanche today. See? You're smiling, too.",Robin
Yeah. I have no idea what that's all about.,Ted
How much does Korean Elvis rock? I'll answer that. Infinity. He rocks... infinity.,Marshall
"Okay, it's time for bed.",Lily
What? No. It's 2:30.,Barney
Nothing good ever happens after 2:00 a.m.,Lily
"You know, I have found, in my travels... that all the best things in life happen after 2:00 a.m. When I look back at the best stories of my life-- the Liberty Bell incident, the little scrape I got in at the Russian Embassy, the almost four-way.",Barney
You never had a four-way.,Marshall
"I said almost. All those things happened after 2:00 a.m. because after 2:00 a.m. is when things get-- audience, say it with me-- legendary.",Barney
We're going home.,Lily
"What's that? Interesting theory, Barney, but I'll need some proof? Okay. Korean Elvis. How would you like to have a drink with me and my friends?",Barney
And it begins.,Barney
"So, um... Hey. I got a new phone. Same as yours. Look.",Ted
"Oh, yeah. Do you like it?",Robin
"Yeah. Yeah. This is some solid small talk. I had that other phone, and it was good, but I think the whole time a little part of me wanted this phone instead. This phone... um... feels right.",Ted
Wow. Weird.,Robin
"Yeah. Uh, I should probably take this.",Ted
I'll be here.,Robin
Hello?,Ted
Sorry about that.,Marshall
Was that Korean Elvis?,Ted
"I'll explain later. Hey, we're headed down to MacLaren's.",Marshall
"Um... Actually... I'm at Robin's. Yeah, and, um... I might have done something bad. I just lied and told her I broke up with Victoria.",Ted
"Ted, I don't want to swear in front of Korean Elvis, but what the bleep are you doing, dude?",Marshall
"What do you expect from me? It's Robin. Victoria's great, but, it's Robin. I've made up my mind. I'm going to end it with Victoria.",Ted
Gonna?,Lily
Yes. First thing tomorrow.,Ted
"Okay, but, but, as of right now at-at... 2:45 a.m. you still have a girlfriend. Ted, I love you. I love Robin. But if you do this right now, your entire future with her will be built on a crime. Just go home, Ted. Don't do this the wrong way.",Lily
I hate how you're always right.,Ted
It's my best and most annoying trait.,Lily
Okay. I'm coming home. I'll see you soon.,Ted
Hey.,Robin
I should probably get going. It's pretty late. I'm sorry. I...,Ted
"Oh. Oh, no. I understand. It's fine. Yeah.",Robin
Can I call you tomorrow?,Ted
Totally. Totally. Call me tomorrow.,Robin
"Okay. Good night, Robin.",Ted
"Good night, Ted.",Robin
"Oh, my God. We're making out.",Robin
Right.,Ted
This is crazy.,Robin
Right? Right?,Ted
"Should we go to my room? I mean, there's five dogs in there, but...",Robin
Yeah.,Ted
Yeah?,Robin
"Yeah. I just, um... I have to run to the bathroom real quick.",Ted
Okay.,Robin
Stop doing that.,Ted
Whatcha doin'?,Victoria
"I'm calling you. We're breaking up. I'm doing this right now, I'm coming out of this bathroom a single man.",Ted
"Okay. Say, Ted... how long do you think that conversation's going to be? Length of an average pee? No. We're gonna be on the phone for at least 20 minutes. Robin's out there. She's gonna think you're in here taking a massive...",Victoria
What do you want from me? People break up. It happens.,Ted
Not like this. Not from the bathroom of the girl that you're about to sleep with.,Victoria
It's not ideal.,Ted
"Come on, Lily. How many women can say they've been personally serenaded by Korean Elvis?",Barney
I think he just spat on me.,Lily
"Barney, you tried, I think that's great, but we're going.",Marshall
"No! No, come on.",Barney
Yes!,Marshall
"Dude, we haen't hit legendary yet. We're only at the le. We still got the gen. The da. The ry.",Barney
"Okay, if we're at the le, then I say we follow it up with a t's go home.",Lily
"Oh, wow, you just got b*rned, phonics style.",Marshall
"Okay, seriously.",Lily
"Hey, you guys remember the time that Lily kicked Korean Elvis in the Nards?",Marshall
You're right. I owe you a real breakup call. I'll call you tomorrow.,Ted
Good. So you're gonna go home?,Victoria
"Why should I have to go home? You know, there's every chance Robin's the woman I'm going to marry.",Ted
Ted.,Victoria
"It could happen. And so really, what's it gonna matter in 50 years if I jump the g*n by one night? Look, I-I know this is a moral gray area, but... It's Robin. And I'm exhausted. I am. I'm exhausted from pretending I'm not in love with her. I think that makes this okay.",Ted
"Oh, please. You just want to get laid.",Victoria
"Yes, I do. You got me. That is exactly what I want right now. And so what? I want this. She wants this. It's happening, and if you have a problem with it, don't be in Germany. It's been nice pretending to talk to you. Thanks for not calling me and good night.",Ted
That's not your phone.,Victoria
This isn't my phone.,Ted
Okay. Bye. ,Robin
Was it...?,Ted
It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.,Robin
"Her favorite CD in the Otis Redding box set? Disc three. My favorite? Any guesses? Anyone? Come on. Disc three! God, Victoria's so amazing! I could talk about her for hours.",Ted
What do you mean could?,Lily
"I'm sorry, it's just... God, I... I'm crazy about this girl. It feels like maybe... I don't want to say it.",Ted
"Trust that impulse, Ted.",Barney
"Hey. Something kind of cool just happened. My story on Pickles, the Singing Dog, just got nominated for a Local Area Media Award.",Robin
A... LAME-A?,Lily
"We prefer Local Area Media Award. Um... there's going to be this big banquet. I know these things aren't much fun, but it would really mean a lot to me if you guys came. And there's an open bar.",Robin
Yes! Word up!,All
"Yeah, put me down for two.",Ted
Really? It's three months away.,Robin
"I know, but... guys, I'm sorry, I'm going to say it. I have a feeling Victoria's going to be around for a long time.",Ted
I'm going to miss Victoria. I should just skip this thing entirely. Robin's still pissed at me after... you know.,Ted
You lied and said you were broken up with Victoria before you actually were so you could try to nail Robin and you wound up losing both girls in one night?,Barney
"Yes, that's what I meant by you know. I haven't seen her in three weeks. She won't return my calls. Look, I shouldn't go.",Ted
"You should definitely go. Look, it's a chance to show her you're still friends and that you support her.",Marshall
"Or it's a chance to mess with her head by showing up with someone hotter. Even better, triple threat-- hotter and bigger boobs.",Barney
That's only two.,Ted
Count again.,Barney
"Barney, I'm not bringing a date. Even if I wanted to, the thing's in two hours.",Ted
So get an escort.,Barney
"By escort, you mean prostitute?",Ted
Why not?,Barney
Because... gross?,Ted
"Oh, gross. What, you have some puritanical hang-up about prostitution? Dude, it's the world's oldest profession.",Barney
You really think that's true?,Marshall
"Oh, yeah. I bet even Cro-Magnons used to give cave hookers, like, an extra fish for putting out.",Barney
"Aha, so then the oldest profession would be fishermen. Kaboom! You've been lawyered.",Marshall
"Come on, Ted, let's get you a hooker. It'll be fun.",Barney
"Okay, to bring to the banquet and hang out with ironically or to actually have sex with?",Ted
Yes.,Barney
No! It's illegal. And did I mention gross?,Ted
"That's adorable. Ted, you're such a hayseed. The companionship business is the growth industry of the 21st century. You do realize that one out of every eight adult women in America is a prostitute.",Barney
You just made that up.,Marshall
Withdrawn.,Barney
"Lawyered. The point is, how long has it been?",Marshall
57 days.,Ted
Is that your water? May I?,Barney
"Yeah, go ahead.",Ted
"Much obliged. 57 days?! Ted, you are in a slump.",Barney
"No, it's not a slump. It's an intentional hiatus from girls. A slump is when you strike out every time you step up to the plate. But I'm off the roster, baby. I'm in the locker room sitting in the whirlpool. And I'll tell you something, it feels pretty good.",Ted
"Yeah, you know what else is in that locker room? A naked dudes hanging brain. Ted, you need a lady. And I've got the next best thing-- Mary. She lives in my building. She's smart, she's hot, she's totally cool.",Barney
"Oh, she sounds great. And who knows? Maybe we'll wind up getting married someday. You know, if we can get a blessing from her pimp.",Ted
You want to judge a fellow human being based solely on one external characteristic? That's racism. And I do not drink with r*cist. Good day.,Barney
"You're just waiting for me to speak, so you can...",Ted
I said good day!,Barney
So should I wear my hair up or down? Lily.,Robin
What?,Lily
You okay?,Robin
"Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm just exhausted from work. The stupid school board took away nap time in all kindergarten classes and now the kids are just going crazy by the end of the day. It's much harder to deal with because, well, I don't get my nap.",Lily
"Wait, you were taking naps when the kids were? Is that safe?",Robin
"Well, they're only five. What are they gonna do to me?",Lily
"Ted's still coming to this thing, right?",Robin
Yep.,Lily
"Do you think, um... hypothetically... it would be weird if I bring a date?",Robin
"Look at you, Scherbotsky, blatantly trying to make Ted jealous.",Lily
"No, it's just this guy at the station. I never get involved with co-workers, but he asked me and I said yes. Is it going to be weird?",Robin
"No, it's not going to be weird at all. (",Lily
Boy. That's going to be really weird.,Marshall
I know.,Lily
Robin's bringing a date.,Marshall
Oh. Okay. That's not weird. She's bringing a date. I'm glad she's moving on.,Ted
"Dude, it's going to be weird.",Marshall
"No, it's fine. Look, in spite of whatever happened between us, Robin and I are still friends. I don't think it'll be weird.",Ted
"Yeah, it won't be weird.",Barney
Thank you.,Ted
Because you're going to bring your own date.,Barney
"Hello, Barney.",Woman
"Hi, Mary. Have you met Ted?",Barney
Nice to meet you Ted.,Mary
"Hi, Mary. Wow. It's, uh, nice to meet you, too.",Ted
So we're going to an award show?,Mary
"Uh, yeah, will you just excuse us for one minute? Barney.",Ted
"See you in two shakes, Mare. You two make yourselves comfortable.",Barney
What the hell?,Ted
"Dude, your narrow-minded views on professional fornicators were harshing my mellow. So I got you a date for the evening.",Barney
You got me a hooker. A really hot hook-- A hooker!,Ted
"Think about it, this is perfect. A: it will make Robin insanely jealous... B: you get to have sex with her... and C: maybe by getting to know Mary, you'll come to see that courtesans are people, too. And D: B all night long.",Barney
I'm not taking a prostitute to Robin's banquet.,Ted
"The only people who will know are you, me and Marshall. No one will suspect a thing. They'll just see you with this unbelievably smoking hot girl and... Okay, that's a little bit suspicious. Look, I'm just trying to expand your horizons a little bit tonight. But if you're not interested, fine, I'm out 500 bucks. Whatever.",Barney
500 bucks?,Ted
"Ted, you're my cabron. You think I'm gonna stick you with some toothless tr*nny from the Port Authority? Look at how hot she is. Robin would be so jealous.",Barney
"I'm not trying to make Robin jealous, Barney. Look, I... tell Mary, thanks, but no thanks. I have a soul.",Ted
Check out Robin's date.,Marshall
I know.,Ted
Is that who I think it is?,Marshall
Yep. It's Sandy Rivers.,Ted
Sandy time. Sandy time!,Ted
"Here we have, on the front page, a story about a... I guess, a guy in a superhero costume climbing the Empire State Building. Looks interesting.",Sandy
"Which Sandy do we want today? French Sandy, p*rn star Sandy...?",Ted
"Yosemite Sandy, definitely.",Marshall
Excellent choice. I love this guy.,Ted
I hate this guy.,Ted
Hey.,Lily
Hi.,Mary
I'm Lily.,Lily
Hi. Mary. It's nice to meet you.,Mary
"Mary is a friend of Barney's. Barney invited her. Just met Mary ourselves. Don't know too much about Mary. Look, a beer.",Marshall
Hey.,Ted
Hi.,Robin
You look nice.,Ted
"Oh, um, Ted, this is Sandy.",Robin
Hi. Sandy Rivers. Use my full name. People get a kick out of it.,Sandy
"Hi, Sandy. Rivers. So are you two, uh...",Ted
Starting a bunch of office rumors? Looks that way. Looks that way.,Sandy
"Oh, how rude of me. Uh, Robin, Sandy... Rivers... this is Mary, my date.",Ted
"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 45th annual Local Area Media Awards. Please say hello to our host for the evening, king of the Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie, Vampire Lou!",Voice
"Man, Vampire Lou just looks great.",Marshall
I can't believe I'm on a date with a hooker.,Ted
"Yeah, I can't believe you let her and Lily go to the ladies' room together, man. Secrets come out in there.",Marshall
"Oh, please. How's it's going to come out? Uh, pass me a towel. P.S., I have sex for money.",Barney
Who has sex for money?,Lily
Nobody. What did you guys talk about in there? Anything interesting?,Marshall
"No, not really. We just chitchatted and I borrowed her lipstick. Why is Vampire Lou the host of a Saturday Afternoon Kung Fu Movie? You know, it just makes no sense. God, that pisses me off.",Lily
"Lily, you okay?",Ted
"Oh, yeah, I'm just tired. And when I get tired, I get cranky.",Lily
Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.,Sandy
Really? I couldn't imagine you cranky.,Lily
Wow. Why are you so tired?,Mary
"Well, I teach kindergarten and the school board took away my nap time, the kids' nap time.",Lily
"Lily, quit your job. Work at a private school. You won't have to deal with the school board, and you'll make a ton more money.",Barney
"Well, guess what, Barney? I don't base all my life decisions on how much money I'm going to make, unlike you and, sadly, my fiance.",Lily
"Well, it's just an internship, for the record.",Marshall
"Yeah, because if I did sacrifice all my values just for an easy buck, what would that make me?",Lily
A prostitute.,Mary
"Exactly. Thank you, Mary.",Lily
"So, Mary, what do you do for a living?",Robin
She's a paralegal.,Barney
"Yes, I'm a paralegal.",Mary
"Oh, so, Mary the paralegal. What does a paralegal do exactly?",Robin
I just assist with day-to-day clerical work in a law firm downtown.,Mary
"Oh, what firm?",Lily
"Douglas, O'Halloran and Stamp.",Mary
That's a real law firm.,Marshall
I know.,Mary
Nice.,Marshall
You're pretty good on your feet.,Ted
Are you flirting with me?,Mary
Is that allowed?,Ted
"Yes, it's encouraged.",Mary
"You know, I wouldn't normally say this on a first date, but... well, considering... I'm just going to say it. You are so hot!",Ted
"Well, thank you.",Mary
You're welcome.,Ted
"Mary, Ted is a great guy. You hold on to him. Don't let him out of your sight for a minute.",Robin
"So, Sandy, what do you do? Oh, wait, I know what you do. You're the guy who reads the paper in the morning.",Ted
"You got me. What do you do, Ted?",Sandy
"Oh, same thing as you-- I read the paper every morning. But then after that, I finish my coffee and I go to my real job as an architect where I make an actual contribution to the world. I'm just kidding. Love your show. You're terrific.",Ted
Thanks. I never tire of hearing that.,Sandy
"Hey, you know that scene in Empire where they lower the helmet onto Darth Vader's head? Do you think that's how Sandy puts his hair on in the morning?",Mary
"You just insulted someone I hate by referencing something I love. Damn, you just got even hotter.",Ted
Hey.,Ted
"Hey. Mary seems nice. Have you kissed her yet, or are you waiting until you're in a serious relationship with someone else?",Robin
"I, uh... I wanted to apologize for everything that happened.",Ted
"And just like that, it's all okay. Roll credits.",Robin
"So you're going to be mad at me forever? What, we're not even friends now?",Ted
We're still friends.,Robin
"Are we? You don't return my calls, we never hang out and now you're trying to make my jealous by waving Edward R. Moron in my face?",Ted
"Oh, and Paralegally Blonde isn't here in her low-cut dress to make me jealous?",Robin
"Oh, so now she's a whore?",Ted
What?,Robin
"You know something? Mary the paralegal is awesome. And you know what else? I didn't come here tonight to make you jealous, I came here to support you as a friend. And frankly, I'm sick of trying.",Ted
I like that guy.,Sandy
Hey.,Ted
Hey. What were you guys talking about over there?,Sandy
"Oh, I was, uh, just telling my friend that I think you're awesome.",Ted
"Well, thanks. You know, this is one of the nicer hotels I've ever been in.",Sandy
"Oh, yeah, my friend did the remodel. You should see the rooms. The views are amazing.",Ted
Yeah? Maybe it's too bad we don't have a room.,Mary
"Room 1506. My treat. You kids go nuts. Actually, don't use the mini-bar. Do it. Come on, Ted, do it. This is one of those things you have to do before you turn 30.",Barney
Sleep with a prostitute?,Ted
"No, lose your virginity. What up. Statistic-- men who have had at least one relationship with a prostitute are 75% more likely to have success in future relationships.",Barney
You just made that up.,Marshall
Withdrawn.,Barney
"Lawyered. Okay, three things. First of all, Robin's category's almost up. And second of all, you cannot do this. It's wrong on every level. And third, I've been placing small items in Sandy's hair all night. He still hasn't noticed.",Marshall
I know I can't do this. I'm not doing this. It's just... it's a shame. She's really cool.,Ted
"Yeah, well... there we go.",Marshall
"Thanks. Oh, wow. This is really a surprise. Um, you know it's nice to be able to share this award with my friends. They're all here tonight. Marshall, Lily, Sandy Rivers... Barney... And that's it. Those are all my friends. Thank you.",Robin
Congratulations.,Marshall
"Oh, thanks. Um, Sandy, do you want to get a cab?",Robin
Sure. Let's go.,Sandy
"Yeah, this party's dead. Mary, you want to go upstairs? We, uh, got a room.",Ted
"Dude, what are you doing?",Marshall
What's it look like?,Ted
"It looks bad, is what it looks like. You cannot do this.",Marshall
"Marshall, she is a really cool girl when you get to know her. Besides, I'm trying to make Robin jealous.",Ted
"Oh, that's real mature.",Marshall
"Marshall, what is up with you and Ted?",Lily
"Nothing, baby. Don't worry about it. Fine. Do what you want. Hey.",Marshall
Should we go?,Mary
Yeah. Thanks. Well... Good night.,Ted
Good night.,Robin
"So, did you and Barney ever...?",Ted
There's not enough money in the world.,Mary
"Oh, thank God.",Ted
"Wow, so they're...? Robin, where's Sandy Rivers?",Marshall
I put him in a cab.,Robin
So you and he aren't...?,Barney
I don't date people I work with. I was just trying to make Ted jealous. Is he...?,Robin
He's off trying to make you jealous.,Marshall
"Oh, well, good for them. And, you know, if Ted likes her, she's probably pretty cool.",Robin
"Lily, I know you're asleep, but I have to tell someone this, and we tell each other everything. So, here it goes. Mary's not a paralegal. She's a prostitute.",Marshall
What?!,Robin
Barney paid for her.,Marshall
Is that true?,Lily
"We were having a conversation about prostitution, and then Barney calls her up and then she shows up at the bar and now she and Ted are upstairs.",Marshall
"Okay, seriously, what is going on with Ted lately? Is he having a nervous breakdown?",Robin
"You know, Barney, for anyone else, this would be a new low, but sadly, for you, it's just a new middle. Oh, my God, I used her lipstick! Ah!",Lily
That's her napkin.,Marshall
No!,Lily
"Okay, well, I guess now is as good a time as any. In keeping with tonight's award show motif, I'd like to announce this evening's big twist ending! Vampire Lou, would you do the honors?",Barney
What?,Marshall
"That's all, Vampire Lou. Nicely done.",Barney
So she's not...?,Marshall
"No. Mary's just a paralegal who lives in my building. Oh-- ha-ha! And here's the best part-- she has no idea that Ted thinks she's a hooker. Oh, come on. If you don't laugh, it just seems mean.",Barney
I feel kind of like Richard Gere.,Ted
"Not shy about your looks, are you?",Mary
"No. You know, Mary, I've never done this before.",Ted
Done what?,Mary
"You know, been... on a date.",Ted
"Yeah, right. Wait, you're kidding, right?",Mary
"No. Why, is that so odd?",Ted
"Well, Ted, I mean, I've been going on dates since I was 15.",Mary
"God, you were just a kid. Well, look, let's just have a few drinks. We'll relax and...",Ted
"Yeah, that sounds great. I had clients riding me all day long.",Mary
Must be tough.,Ted
"Yeah. I mean, this one guy just wouldn't leave me alone. I mean, talk about a**l. Well, here we are.",Mary
"Okay, look, Mary, I like you a lot. I'm sort of amazed at how much I like you, but I can't do this. You're a hooker.",Ted
What?,Mary
"Look, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I'm sorry, that's a deal-breaker for me. I'm not going to have sex with a prostitute.",Ted
"No... Ted, I'm a paralegal.",Mary
"Come on, Mary, there's no one else around. You're a hooker.",Ted
"No, Ted... I'm a paralegal.",Mary
"No, you're a hooker.",Ted
"No, I'm a paralegal.",Mary
You're a paralegal.,Ted
That was not funny.,Ted
"Not funny, dude.",Marshall
"I know, it was hilarious.",Barney
Why would you do that?,Ted
I did it to prove a point.,Barney
What point?,Ted
"Stay with me. It's going to come to me. No. Ah, okay, here's the point. You thought that Mary was a sure thing, right? So what happened? She took you up to a hotel room on the first date. All you have to do is be that confident with every girl you meet and your slump is over.",Barney
"So the message is, I should treat every woman like a whore?",Ted
"Come on, dude, you should be thanking me.",Barney
She slapped me and stormed off.,Ted
Can you blame her? You called her a hooker.,Barney
"I'm sorry, dude, it was funny.",Marshall
"Yeah. Well, it's getting late. I should get back to my room.",Ted
Your room?,Barney
"Yeah, that really expensive hotel room you put on your credit card-- never checked out. By the way, you know what's super fun? Pouring Dom Perignon down a bathtub drain. Well, it's almost 3:00. Got a massage. Toodles.",Ted
"Come on, if you don't laugh, it just seems mean.",Marshall
Van Smoot is available.,Marshall
"Oh, my God!",Lily
There was a cancellation two months from now.,Marshall
You want to have our wedding in two months? No. It's impossible.,Lily
"It's Van Smoot, Lily. It's the dream!",Marshall
"No, there's just not enough time. There's no way... Oh! Mini-vomit.",Lily
"Okay, look, look, look. I know that it's sudden, but check it. If we don't take this, guess who's on their way with a deposit check.",Marshall
Todd and Valerie?,Lily
We got to make a decision. Todd and Valerie are in motion. Van Smoot!,Marshall
"Oh! Kids, color!",Lily
"Come on, come on, come on.",Marshall
"Hello, Marshall. Lily.",Todd
Todd. Valerie. Stairs.,Marshall
I can't believe it. We got Van Smoot House.,Lily
It is on. It is on! Like the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan.,Marshall
What?,Robin
You're a wonder.,Marshall
Wow! You guys are getting married in two months.,Ted
How are you going to get everything done?,Robin
"Division of labor. Everyone's got a job to do, so listen up. Okay, Robin, you and Ted go to the florist.",Lily
Was it...?,Ted
It was your girlfriend. You might want to call her back.,Robin
"Or, actually, Robin, why don't you go to the florist? And, Ted, I could use your keen architectural eye on... on the invitations.",Lily
"Wow. That was really awkward, Lil. And still. It's still really awkward right now.",Marshall
"Hey, what about me? What's my job? What do I get to do?",Barney
"Okay, your job is very simple. At the wedding, do not sleep with anyone even remotely related to me.",Lily
"Lil, you know I can't promise that.",Barney
"Shh! Shh! Look how cute she looks. All tuckered out. Hey, babe. Hey, little one. Hey, Lilypad.",Marshall
Crap! Band! We forgot a band! It's just gonna be silence and then people chewing.,Lily
"Shh! Shh! Baby, don't worry about it. I called The 88!",Marshall
Who?,Lily
The 88. They're this awesome band. They played my law review party. They were found guilty. On three counts of rocking.,Marshall
"I saw them two months ago at my cousin Bonzo's wedding, they were great.",Ted
John Bonzo Bonham from Led Zeppelin?,Lily
"Yes, Lily, my cousin, the drummer from Led Zeppelin, who died in 1980, got married two months ago.",Ted
"Look, I... I can't sign off on a band I've never even seen. We... we don't even know if they can play our song. They're... they're going to have to come over here and audition.",Lily
"Baby, The 88 don't audition. They're, like, the Wiggles of wedding bands.",Marshall
"Well, then... I have to say no.",Lily
"Baby, they're only holding the date until Monday.",Marshall
"Well... well, are they playing anywhere this weekend?",Lily
Let me check their Website.,Marshall
What?,Lily
"Lily, you're being a wee bit intense about this band thing.",Ted
"Intense? I have a wedding to plan in nine weeks for 200 people. Even if a dinosaur should poke his head out of my butt and consume this coffee table, I need you to roll with it, okay?",Lily
Wow.,Ted
Guys! I just tasted an amazing caterer.,Barney
We already have a caterer.,Lily
"Oh, right. You're getting married. You see what I did there? Took a...",Barney
It looks like The 88 are playing at a high school prom in New Jersey tomorrow.,Marshall
A prom? Can... can we go to that?,Lily
"Yeah, we'll just call the high school, they'll let us stand in the back and watch.",Marshall
"Yeah. No, they won't.",Lily
Why not?,Marshall
'Cause it turns out we're not in high school.,Lily
"No sweat, we'll just sneak in.",Barney
We're not sneaking in to a high school prom.,Marshall
"Yes, we are. It's the only way.",Lily
"You're getting on board with Barney's idea? Man, you really have snapped.",Ted
"It's nine weeks till the wedding. At this point, I'd say yes to just about anything.",Lily
Well...,Barney
"No, Barney.",Lily
I'll go with you.,Robin
Really?,Lily
Yeah. I never got to go to my prom. We always had field hockey nationals in the spring.,Robin
Lesbian.,Barney
The cough is supposed to cover the lesbian.,Robin
"No, I'm trying to start a thing where the cough is separate.",Barney
Do you think we look young enough to blend in at a high school?,Lily
"Please, I'm ageless, Scherbotsky just needs a good night's sleep, and you've got statutory written all over your body.",Barney
"Hey, why don't we all go?",Ted
I don't know-- more people might be harder to sneak in. We don't want to mess things up for Lily.,Robin
"Yeah, you're right. Besides, Marshall and I have been planning on having a guy's night out before the wedding. Why don't we just make it tomorrow night?",Ted
Sounds awesome. We should go out and just get freakin' weird.,Marshall
Yeah.,Ted
"'Cause, you know, you be a bad, bad man, and I be an outlaw.",Marshall
"Wow. Hey, Thelma, Louise, y'all don't drive off no cliffs now, ya hear? Lame! But seriously, leave me a message, and we'll meet up later.",Barney
"All right, what do you think?",Lily
Horrible.,Barney
You're gonna make such a great dad.,Lily
"You look so classy and nice. You're going to stick out like a sore thumb. Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days, with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris? They all dress like strippers. It's go ho or go home.",Barney
"Well, we have to get in. I have to see this band, 'cause we have to make a decision by Monday, 'cause I'm getting married in 71 days, and we still don't have...",Lily
"Shh. Sweetie, just focus on one thing at a time, okay? Right now, you just have to dress like a whore and that's it.",Robin
All right.,Lily
"That's the spirit. Now, ladies, slut up!",Barney
"I never thought this would be a bad thing, but my wardrobe just isn't slutty enough.",Robin
I didn't know I still had this.,Lily
What?,Robin
The dress I wore to my actual prom.,Lily
"Dude, you are the hottest girl at this prom, and not like in a corporate, plastic way. Like, truly, truly hot. Like a hot soul.",Scooter
"Aw, you look great, too, Scooter.",Lily
So big news. I heard from umpire school. I'm in!,Scooter
"Oh, disco! I am so happy for you.",Lily
"You mean happy for us, right, babe?",Scooter
"Scooter, you're gonna be an umpire someday.",Lily
"No, baby. We're gonna be an umpire someday.",Scooter
"Nice. You ladies look good, but your outfits are missing just one thing.",Barney
"No, Barney, this is as far as we're going to go. I'm not showing anymore...",Robin
Two beautiful flowers for two beautiful flowers.,Barney
Aw. Sweet. Thank you.,Lily
"Oh, Robin, are you tearing up?",Barney
"No. I've never been to prom before, okay?",Robin
We got to go. See ya.,Lily
"Bye, have fun. See you.",Ted
"They grow up into skanks so fast, don't they, Ted?",Marshall
"So, what, we ready for tonight?",Ted
Yeah. Just one thing we got to do first.,Marshall
sh*t of Jim Beam?,Ted
Yeah.,Marshall
Yes!,Ted
And then I promised Lily that we'd stuff 200 wedding invitations.,Marshall
What?!,Ted
"I'm sorry, dude, but you saw how stressed out she is.",Marshall
"Come on! You've been doing wedding stuff nonstop. Take a break. Once you're married, if we go out and you get so drunk you throw up, it'll be sad, but if we do it tonight... it'll be less sad.",Ted
"Okay, it'll be cool-- I'll tell you what. We'll make a game out of it. First one to stuff a hundred invitations gets a big prize.",Marshall
"Do I look like I'm four? All right, what kind of prize are we talking?",Ted
"Wow, a lot more security than when we were kids.",Lily
Is this gonna work?,Robin
"Yeah. Look, when I was 17, I used to sneak into clubs all the time. It's all about confidence. Follow me. Whee-hoo! Happy prom, everybody. Going to prom-- whee-hoo!",Lily
"Okay, bye. Okay, look, I just need to see the band. I'm getting married in two months, and...",Lily
"Hey, ho, hey!",Barney
Wow. Ma'am? Check and mate.,Lily
"It's cool. Time to activate plan B. Scherbotsky, how comfortable are you with a crossbow? Scherbotsky?",Barney
"Hey, guys. Do you want to take two hot girls to prom?",Robin
We don't have that kind of money.,Boy
For free.,Robin
"Oh, hell yeah!",Boy
"Great. I'm Robin, this is my friend Lily.",Robin
Hi. Shall we?,Lily
Sure. I knew it would happen. This is the dream.,Boy
"Oh, hey, wait. How's Barney getting in?",Robin
Don't worry about me. I'll get in. Oh... I'll get in.,Barney
We're in!,Lily
Thank you. We're going to take a break.,Singer
"Oh, you're kidding me.",Lily
"Yeah, what the hell? It's prom. That tastes like cough syrup.",Robin
"Nerds who aren't good at math? Life's going to be rough, boys.",Robin
"Hi. Excuse me. I was wondering if you guys could play Good Feeling by the Violent Femmes. I know it's probably not in your repertoire, but I'm getting married and my fianc√© wants to hire you guys as the band, but I can't sign off on it until I hear you play Good Feeling because that's our song, and what kind of wedding band would you be if you couldn't play our song, right? Right?",Lily
"Look, I'm kinda wasted right now, so I didn't understand any of that. But, uh, if you get us the sheet music, we'll play your song.",Man
My phlegm feels looser.,Robin
"This is pathetic. It's guys' night. We should be out in a bar getting in fights. If I got in a fight, would you have my back?",Ted
You know it.,Marshall
"I'd have your back, too.",Ted
That's cool.,Marshall
"What, you don't think you'd need my help? You don't know what I can do. I'm like... like a berserker.",Ted
"Okay, Ted. ",Marshall
"Hey, it's Robin. Um, Lily needs you to download the sheet music for Good Feeling and bring it out here, like, now.",Robin
Hang on. It's Robin. She wants me to go to prom. Can Ted come?,Marshall
Wait! Don't ask! That's so lame! I don't even want to go anyway.,Ted
"Uh, I don't know. Things have been so weird between us.",Robin
What'd she say? What'd she say?,Ted
"He lied and told me he broke up with his girlfriend to try to hook up with me. I mean, I know he apologized for it but it's just, it's not easy to forgive. Look, if you absolutely must bring Ted, it's, it's not like I'm going to claw my own eyes out if he comes.",Robin
"Okay, bye. She totally wants you to come.",Marshall
"All right, sheet music's on the way. Are you okay?",Robin
There's just so much to do for this wedding. My head is swirling. It's just all moving too fast.,Lily
How is it moving too fast? We've been together for two years.,Scooter
I just... I just don't want everything in my life to be decided already.,Lily
"What's decided? I go to umpire school, you go to college. We move into my dad's house in Staten Island. We have kids, we grow old together. What's decided? It's wide open!",Scooter
"Scooter, when I go off to college, that's the end for us.",Lily
"You're, you're breaking up with me?",Scooter
"There's still so much I want to do. I want to travel, live overseas as an artist, maybe have a lesbian relationship. Plus, I think I was just dating you 'cause you look a little bit like Kurt Cobain.",Lily
"I can't believe this. I can change. I can look more like Kurt Cobain. Please, just don't leave me. I'm nothing without you, baby.",Scooter
Please don't put that kind of pressure on me! It's too much!,Lily
What?,Lily
"Well, we did promise them one dance.",Robin
"Yeah, sure, okay. So Andrew, what's your big plan? What's life going to be like after tonight?",Lily
"Well, you know I got it all worked out. Uh, leave this place in my dust, four awesome years at college, and then I'll move to Prague or start my own video game company or something.",Andrew
"No, you won't.",Lily
I won't?,Andrew
"No, you won't accomplish anything you set out to. You'll get a girlfriend the first day of college and you'll give up your independence and you'll never live abroad and you'll wind up old before your time wondering Whatever happened to my hopes and my dreams?",Lily
Whoa. You really think I'll get a girlfriend?,Andrew
"Oh, Sean, look, um, you're a nice guy, but I just don't... No, you're not getting lucky tonight.",Robin
Okay.,Ted
"What's it to you, giant turtle?",Marshall
"Oh, hey. Where's Lily?",Marshall
She's in the bathroom.,Barney
"Wait here, I should go talk to the band.",Marshall
All right.,Ted
How did you guys get in here?,Barney
We just snuck in the back.,Ted
You just snu... Are you serious? I've been trying to get in here all night. I finally paid a janitor 200 bucks to let me borrow this mascot costume.,Barney
But you got in. Slow and steady won the race.,Ted
"Hey, bro, have you seen my fianc√©e Lily?",Marshall
"Your fianc√©e? Whoa, tonight she's with me, bro. Unless you're looking for trouble.",Andrew
"Listen, little buddy, I understand it's prom and the adrenaline's pumping, but...",Marshall
"No, not tonight. I've waited too long for this. I finally got a girl and I'm not going to let you take her away from me.",Andrew
"Whoa, whoa. Look, let's not get carried away.",Marshall
Yah! Nunchaku!,Andrew
I can't believe I unloaded like that on a high school senior.,Lily
"I can't believe a high school senior unloaded like that on me. I'm going to ask you something and, um, maybe it's crazy 'cause you guys are the cutest couple ever. But, um, are you having second thoughts?",Robin
Yeah. But not about Marshall. About me. I just keep thinking about the girl I was ten years ago and wondering what happened to her.,Lily
"I don't want to be tied down. I want to live in France and Spain and Italy and just soak up life and put it on a canvas, even if it means being a waitress in crappy caf√©s for five years, I don't care. I'm going to be a painter. And I can't do any of that with a, with a boyfriend shackled around my neck, you know? But anyway, I'm blabbering. Way to make new friends, Lily. I'm sorry. What was your name again?",Lily
Marshall.,Man
"Nice to meet you, Marshall. Guess we're hallmates.",Lily
Yeah.,Marshall
It works.,Lily
Violent Femmes. I love this song.,Marshall
"Me, too.",Lily
"I didn't have any of the experiences I set out to. The travel, the bohemian art life, my big lesbian experience. I didn't do any of it.",Lily
"Lily, you're marrying your best friend in the world. I mean, isn't that worth all the other experiences combined?",Robin
Yeah.,Lily
"And look, you can still travel, I mean, you can still paint. And as far as your lesbian experience... Happy?",Robin
"Yeah. So field hockey, huh?",Lily
Shut up.,Robin
"Oh, come on-- you're the one who let in a kid with nunchakus. You call yourself security guards? I was just defending my boy here.",Ted
I totally could have taken that kid.,Marshall
"Uh, yeah, and I totally had your back, so...",Ted
"Well, I don't need it, but thanks.",Marshall
"Uh, yeah, you did, and you're welcome.",Ted
"No, the kid was totally, like, a white belt and I'm gigantic. Listen, guys, I'm sorry. Please, I just need to get in there for one more song.",Marshall
"You guys will thank me for this later, okay? Listen, Don, Ray, can't we all...?",Barney
"You know, for a turtle, he's surprisingly quick.",Ted
This one goes out to that redhead girl and that tall guy.,Singer
So how was your first prom?,Ted
"You tell me. I hated my dress, my date got wasted and puked on me, there was a huge fight and I kissed a girl.",Robin
"So, basically, it was a prom.",Ted
"Okay, I've missed you. Not in a we're-going-to-make-out way, not even in an I-forgive-you way. Just in a I've-missed-you way.",Robin
I'll take what I can get.,Ted
"And that, my friends, is why you don't get your money's worth when you wear jeans to a strip club.",Barney
"So you got to admit, The 88 are rocking our song.",Marshall
"Yeah, it's good.",Lily
"Band? Check. Two months, baby. Two months.",Marshall
Two months.,Lily
"And for the birthday boy, lasagna.",Waitress
Thank you.,Ted
Careful. The plate is very hot.,Waitress
"'Kay. Oh, go on, touch it.",Ted
"Ah! Sweet damn, that's a hot plate.",Lily
"All right, so, Barney, are you doing this or what?",Ted
"Oh, geez, Barney, don't do this.",Robin
"I have to, it's my birthday present to Ted.",Barney
"You don't have to. Please, it's going to be embarrassing and we're going to have to stop coming here, which will suck... in addition to probably being kind of healthy.",Marshall
"Come on, Marshall, it's the greatest pickup line of all time. Barney.",Ted
"Oy, gevalt.",Marshall
"Ah... Happy birthday, Ted.",Barney
Whoo-hoo!,Ted
"Uh, excuse me, has anyone ever told y... Oh, my God.",Barney
What?,Woman
Oh! Call an ambulance!,Barney
What's going on?,Woman
"Try not to speak. Here, sit down. Just don't talk, don't talk.",Barney
Is she okay?,Waitress
"I'm serious, call 911.",Barney
What's wrong? What's the matter?,Woman
"Shh! Shh! Just don't move. Don't move. Just try... Here, have some water. Water! Here, drink this. Shh! Shh!",Barney
"You know, the more I watch this, the less convinced I am that it's the greatest pickup line of all time.",Robin
Wait for it.,Ted
"28. Two more 'til the big one, three-oh.",Lily
"Still, you know, another year older. Still single. You don't hear your Tedological clock ticking?",Lily
Nope. I hit the snooze button.,Ted
And here come the paramedics.,Robin
"Oh, thank God, you're here.",Barney
What is going on?!,Paramedic
I think there might be some internal bleeding. Probably some fractures. We got to get her to the hospital.,Barney
What are you talking about?,Woman
You've had a terrible fall.,Barney
"No, I haven't.",Woman
Really? 'Cause I could swear you fell straight out of heaven. Angel... Give him your number. What? Give him your number. What?,Barney
Give him your number.,All
"Come on, guys, you're embarrassing me.",Barney
Give him your number.,All
What are you...? Come on. They're not going to stop 'til you give me your number.,Barney
All right!,Woman
It works!,Barney
I cannot believe that she gave him her number.,Marshall
Maybe she really does have a brain injury.,Robin
"Thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone. It's been fun. It's Wendy the waitress. Tip her well. Thanks a lot, guys. Troilus and Cressida. Neighborhood Playhouse. Check them out, they're good.",Barney
"I realize why I'm still single. I'm picky. I'm not going to settle. If I'm going to marry someone, she has to be perfect.",Ted
"Well, what's perfect?",Lily
It's not like I have a list.,Ted
"Oh, yes, you do.",Robin
"Attractive, college-educated, she wants two kids-- a boy and a girl...",Ted
That's not hard. I know at least...,Lily
"I'm not done. She likes dogs, Otis Redding, does the crossword. She's into sports, but not so much so that her legs are, like, more muscular than mine. That weirds me out. And she plays bass guitar like Kim Deal from the Pixies.",Ted
Or Kim Gordon from Sonic Youth.,Marshall
"Any Kim from any cool band, really. Can't be too picky.",Ted
You're never going to find this girl.,Lily
Exactly. So I'm just going to wait for her to come to me. I am done trying to plan the unplannable.,Ted
"So, what, you think fate's just going to take care of it?",Marshall
That's the plan.,Ted
"Whoa, you're up early.",Ted
"Yeah, thought I'd whip up some pancakes.",Lily
Does Marshall know?,Ted
He's still sound asleep.,Lily
"Awesome. So awesome. God! Best girl ever. Screw these pancakes, I should cover you in syrup and gobble you up.",Marshall
"Please don't do that. Hey, is this milk any good?",Ted
"Oh, yeah, that totally got me yesterday.",Marshall
"God, why didn't you throw it away?",Ted
I'm going shopping after work. I'll pick up some milk.,Lily
Oh...! These pancakes are delightful.,Marshall
"What's wrong, baby?",Lily
This is the high point of my day.,Marshall
"Hey, Barney, I had some questions about filling out these requisition forms.",Marshall
Binoculars. Second pair on my desk.,Barney
"I don't have time to be creepy, dude. I have a lot of work to do.",Marshall
"Just take a look, will ya? Okay, corner office. Top floor. Check out that guy. Name's Clark Butterfield. He works over at Nicholson, Hewitt and West and every morning, he orders a sandwich from the deli downstairs.",Barney
So?,Marshall
"So guess what I did to that sandwich? Here, I took a picture.",Barney
Oh! Sweet Lord.,Marshall
And now I'm e-mailing said picture to him.,Barney
Ooh! Duck! That is sick! Why would you do that?,Marshall
Who knows? This feud goes so far back I can't remember who fired the first sh*t.,Barney
You?,Marshall
"Totally. Well, look, if you would just... help me fill out these forms, that would be great.",Barney
What?,Marshall
"Butterfield is going to retaliate within the next four hours. That's been his pattern. This is w*r, Eriksen. I need you to clear your schedule, call Lily, tell her you'll be home late.",Barney
This is stupid.,Marshall
"Stu... Come on, man, I didn't recruit you to work here for your lawyering k*ll. I recruited you to be my executive mischief consultant.",Barney
"This is a job for me, Barney. It's a way to make some extra wedding money, and that's it. Now I'm sorry, but I have work to do.",Marshall
"Tracy, could you come in here, please? Would you please inform Mr. Eriksen that I'm no longer speaking to him.",Barney
"Mr. Eriksen, Mr. Stinson is no longer...",Tracy
"I get it. Thank you, Tracy.",Marshall
Hello?,Ted
Hello. May I speak with a Mr. Ted Mosby?,Man
Speaking.,Ted
"Mr. Mosby, how you doing, sir? Bob Rorschach over here at Love Solutions. You signed up for our services about six months ago.",Man
"Uh, yeah. You guys never found me a match.",Ted
"Right. Well... actually, that's why I'm calling. We found her, sir. We found your soul mate.",Bob
I don't understand. What happened to Ellen Pierce? Doesn't she run this place?,Ted
"Well, my firm bought out the company. You know, we're a high-end meats and textiles conglomerate, but the geniuses at corporate decided they wanted to diversify, so... here I am.",Bob
So I'm in good hands. You found me a match?,Ted
There she is. Your soul mate. That'll be 500 bucks.,Bob
"No way. The last time I did this, the girl turned out to be engaged.",Ted
She's not engaged. She's your soul mate. Just read the file.,Bob
"All right, fine. Set it up.",Ted
"You wanted to see me, so I guess that means we're talking again?",Marshall
Will you taste this latte for me? I think they gave me decaf.,Barney
Tastes normal to me.,Marshall
"That's what I thought, too. Then I got this e-mail from Butterfield.",Barney
"Oh, God!",Marshall
It got me as well.,Barney
"Well, then why did you have me drink it?!",Marshall
Because now... you're in.,Barney
Okay. Don't think I'm overlooking the obvious fact that I should just be mad at you. But Executive Mischief Consultant Marshall Eriksen reporting for duty. Let's make that bastard pay. You think that we should brush our teeth first?,Marshall
"Yeah, it's probably a good idea.",Barney
Lily?,Ted
"Hey, Ted, are you busy?",Lily
Um... yes.,Ted
"Oh, right. Soul mate. Forgot. Listen, could you take a cab out to Duchess County and change a flat on Marshall's Fiero?",Lily
What? What? No. Can't you just call Marshall?,Ted
"Marshall can't know about this. Look, Ted, it's dark, I don't know how to change a tire, and I've stumbled into the beginning of a very scary campfire story. Can you please hurry?",Lily
"I can't, I'm waiting...",Ted
"Oh, my God, is that a drifter with a hook for a hand? No, drifter, no!",Lily
"Come on, Lily.",Ted
But you see my point.,Lily
"All right, stay there. I'm on my way.",Ted
"Oh, thank God. I'm so sorry about this. Did you get ahold of your date?",Lily
Yes.,Ted
And was she okay about pushing it back?,Lily
Yes. Because she's perfect. So what am I doing here?,Ted
You can never tell Marshall.,Lily
I won't.,Ted
Ever. Swear. Swear on the lives of your unborn boy and girl.,Lily
I swear on Luke and Leia.,Ted
"About a month ago, I started getting insomnia. Marrying Marshall had been all I wanted for a long time. But, now that it was really happening, it seemed kind of huge and scary.",Lily
Did you talk to Marshall about it?,Ted
"He wouldn't have understood. He's not exactly nervous about tying the knot. So I spent my nights reading, painting, setting the high score on Super b*mb Man...",Lily
That was you? Awesome!,Ted
"I know! I just got in the zone and... Not the point of the story. And then I started thinking about Victoria and how she followed her dream to Germany, and I found that art fellowship.",Lily
Let me guess. It's somewhere far away.,Ted
"San Francisco. But it's not like I'm going to do it. The dates conflict with the wedding. But I love painting, and I've always wondered if I'm any good. This was a way to find out. And the interview is tonight. In New Haven.",Lily
You don't want to get married.,Ted
Of course I want to get married. I... It's not like I was ever going to do it. I just... I just really wanted to see if I could get this.,Lily
"Lily, we live in the center of art and culture in America. I'm sure you could find a program here that's just as selective. But you chose one in a city 3,000 miles away, and you didn't tell Marshall. I think it's pretty clear what that means.",Ted
"Okay, I was... I was having second thoughts. But I'm not any more. I... I mean, this flat tire was a sign. I'm not supposed to do this. I'm supposed to go home and-and be with Marshall. You must think I'm so stupid.",Lily
I don't think you're stupid.,Ted
I love Marshall.,Lily
I know you do. Come here. It's okay. Look... Marriage is big. You're allowed to freak out.,Ted
But why am I the only one? How come Marshall isn't doing anything crazy?,Lily
So all we need is one large shipping box and 100 white mice.,Marshall
All done.,Ted
"Ted, let's go to New Haven.",Lily
"Lily, don't do this to yourself.",Ted
"I just need to know if I can get in. If I do this interview, and get into the program, then I'll know, and I can forget all about it, and get married. Come on! It's an adventure.",Lily
"No, it's not an adventure. It's a mistake.",Ted
"Okay, yes, it's a mistake. I know it's a mistake. But there are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it's a mistake is to make the mistake, and look back, and say, Yep. That was a mistake. So, really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake, because then you go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not. And, damn it, I've made no mistakes! I've done all of this-- my life, my relationship, my career-- mistake-free. Does any of this make sense to you?",Lily
"I don't know. You said mistake a lot. Lily, don't do this.",Ted
"Ted, I'm getting married in two months, and I'm freaking out, and you're my best friend, and you just have to forgive me for this.",Lily
Forgive you for what? ,Ted
"Anything, bro.",Barney
I need you to come up to Duchess County and pick me up.,Ted
No.,Barney
It's kind of an emergency.,Ted
What are you doing in Duchess County?,Barney
Apple picking. Can you just get up here?,Ted
"I wish I could help, buddy, but I'm stuck here at work. We're kind of swamped.",Barney
Is that Ted?,Marshall
Yeah. He's stuck in Duchess County.,Barney
Don't you have a big date tonight?,Marshall
"Uh... Marshall. Hi. Yes. Yes, I do.",Ted
So what are you doing in Duchess County?,Marshall
Can't a brother go apple picking without getting the third degree? Damn!,Ted
"Okay, well, hang on. I'm coming to get you.",Marshall
No!,Ted
"Relax, man. I'll take the Fiero.",Marshall
"No, no, no. Just... forget it. Ha, ha! A little prank. I'm not in Duchess County.",Ted
So that's the prank? That you're not in Duchess County?,Marshall
Yep. Gotcha! Classic! Gotta go.,Ted
"Hey, check out this one. It actually looks like Butterfield.",Barney
"You know, over at the NRDC, it's a bunch of really committed people who take their job of saving the earth very, very seriously. Which is great, and everything, but I can't imagine having this much fun over there.",Marshall
You thinking about coming to work here full-time?,Barney
"Maybe. Don't tell Lily, okay?",Marshall
Taking off for the night.,Tracy
"Thanks, Tracy.",Barney
Are you guys planning on punching some holes in that box?,Tracy
Of course we are. Were you going to think of that?,Barney
No.,Marshall
That would have been bad.,Barney
Horrible.,Marshall
"Need a ride, cowboy?",Robin
Sorry. I don't get in vans with strangers.,Ted
"Hmm, too bad. I got candy.",Robin
Candy?!,Ted
So you're not going to tell me what you were doing by the side of a highway in Duchess County?,Robin
Nope. Sworn to secrecy.,Ted
"Oh, come on.",Robin
I like your hat.,Ted
Right. This is embarrassing. I got highlights.,Robin
"Oh, for the waiting room of your dental practice? Highlights is a children's magazine.",Ted
"Yeah, I got it. I thought it might look cool. Of course my colorist took highlights to mean, I want to look like a tiger, hence the hat.",Robin
Oh. I gotta see this.,Ted
No way.,Robin
Please. I bet it doesn't look that bad. I bet it looks grr-eat!,Ted
"So, she says, changing the subject. Big date tonight. How does she rate on the Mosby checklist?",Robin
"Kind of amazingly. Uh, she's 28, like me.",Ted
"Wow, I'm 28. Hmm.",Robin
"Uh, college educated-- check. Plays tennis-- check. Uh, favorite book is Love in the Time of Cholera-- check.",Ted
I read that. More like Love in the Time of Don't Bothera.,Robin
"You know, it's very rude to wear a hat indoors. I'm just saying.",Ted
We're not indoors. We're in a van.,Robin
Vans have doors-- let me see your hair.,Ted
Never. What else?,Robin
She loves lasagna.,Ted
Barf.,Robin
"You know, I am sensing a pattern here.",Ted
What else?,Robin
"Let's see what else... Oh, she doesn't look like a tiger-- check.",Ted
And she's looking to get married and have kids?,Robin
Check and check. She wants two kids... a boy and a girl.,Ted
"Wow. You know, I've been thinking about this. I think I want to have zero kids.",Robin
Really? You don't want kids?,Ted
"You know, Ted, not everyone is as much of a woman as you. Hey. I'm driving. Look at that. 8:56. You're early.",Robin
"Hey, thanks for picking me up.",Ted
Good luck on your date. I hope she's everything you're looking for.,Robin
Thanks.,Ted
"All right, you've clearly had a rough night. I want you to go in there with a smile on your face, so, uh, here's what I'm going to do.",Robin
You're going to show me your hair?,Ted
"Actually, I was going to show you my breasts, but... sure, we can do hair.",Robin
You just made my night.,Ted
Go.,Robin
"Tomorrow morning, Barney's going to send out the package, and Butterfield's going to be knee-deep in angry white mice. Oh, hey, dude.",Marshall
"Hey, guys.",Ted
Hi.,Lily
"Hey. So, Lil, did you, uh, get the milk?",Ted
"Yeah. Yeah, I-I got it.",Lily
You think you might want to... drink the milk?,Ted
"No. Nope, I'm good. I don't need any milk.",Lily
"Look, guys, I know milk is important-- it's got vitamin A, vitamin D, it's a great way to start the morning-- but Ted just had a huge date. How'd it go, dude?",Marshall
I didn't go.,Ted
What? Why?,Marshall
I changed my mind. I don't want to meet her.,Ted
Why? She sounds perfect.,Marshall
I don't want perfect. I want Robin.,Ted
"Oh, God, not this again. Ted, it's a mistake.",Marshall
Maybe. But it's a mistake I have to make.,Ted
Wrong. It's a mistake you don't have to make. Look at the evidence. You and Robin have tried this again and again...,Marshall
"Ah, sweet damn, that's a hot plate.",Lily
"Hey, is this milk any good?",Ted
So... what do you think?,Ted
"Robin again? Ted, the universe clearly does not want you and Robin to be together. Don't piss off the universe. The universe will slap you.",Barney
But don't you think the universe has more important things to worry about than my dating life?,Ted
Unless your dating life is the glue holding the entire universe together... Whoa. Chills. Anybody else get chills?,Marshall
"Look, I realize we've been down this road before, but the fact is, whatever I do, it all keeps coming back to Robin, so... I gotta do this. ",Ted
That wasn't me. That was the universe.,Barney
"Thanks, Lou. Boy, too bad. Our big Metro News One camping trip was going to be this weekend.",Robin
"Yeah, but camping out in the rain? No fun. Muddy. Yuck.",Sandy
Guess we'll have to take a rain check.,Robin
"And we'll check in with you tomorrow, New York.",Sandy
Have a great night.,Robin
"And, we're clear.",Man
"Bummer. I was hoping to finally have sex with you this weekend, Scherbotsky.",Sandy
"Well, I'd give you the I don't date coworkers speech again, but, God, you must have that sum'bitch memorized by now.",Robin
"Shame, though. It was a pretty hot show tonight. The rhythmic give and take of our improvised banter there at the end really got my freak juice flowing.",Sandy
"Dude, he's right. How many times do you have to watch this crash and burn before you say, enough?",Marshall
"One more. One more time. One more big, beautiful, stupid romantic gesture. And then, whatever she says, yes or no, that's it. If it's yes, great. If it's no, then I am done going after Robin forever.",Ted
"So what's this big, beautiful romantic gesture?",Lily
"I am going to make her... a mix CD. No, I'm kidding. I got a plan. Lily, I'm going to need the spare key to Robin's apartment.",Ted
"I see where this is going. Ted, waiting naked in a girl's bed wearing whipped cream undies does not work... usually. The setting-- Martha's Vineyard, 1999. The characters: Yours truly and a raven-haired au pair by the name...",Barney
"Universe. So, this plan you speak of?",Lily
Remember the first night Robin and I went out? I stole a blue French horn for her and it almost worked.,Ted
"Yeah. Dude, that was awesome, but how are you ever going to top that?",Marshall
She should be here any second.,Ted
"Uh, we're pretty hungry. When do we get our pizza?",Musician
"Enough with the... we'll go get pizza later, all right? Just...",Ted
Damn it.,Robin
Hello.,Lily
"Hey, Lily, I'm locked out of my apartment. I need to come pick up my extra key.",Robin
Extra key? Do I have an extra key to your apartment?,Lily
"Yes, I gave it to you.",Robin
"Oh, right. That key. Yeah, I lost it.",Lily
"Great, now I gotta go to the locksmith.",Robin
"No, wait, uh... Maybe you should just knock.",Lily
"Knock? Lily, my dogs aren't that well trained.",Robin
"Uh, Robin, I-I gotta go. Just knock, okay?",Lily
Summer fellowship?,Marshall
Just knock. Okay.,Robin
Hi.,Ted
Hi.,Robin
"Robin... I've sort of said this already. I mean I've half said it. I've tried to say it, and I've said it badly. So this is me, just saying it. With strings. I'm crazy about you. I think we should be together. What do you say? What do you say?",Ted
Yes. No. I don't know.,Robin
Those are the three options.,Ted
"Ted, this is so...",Robin
I know.,Ted
"I mean, I come home, I was going to watch Jeopardy and there's a string quartet and... I have to pee.",Robin
"Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, well, go ahead. We'll, uh, we'll wait.",Ted
"Yeah, 'cause when we talked earlier, you said there'd be pizza.",Musician
"No, I said I'd get you a pizza afterwards. Look, could we talk about this later? I'm sort of professing my love here.",Ted
Sure. We're not getting any pizza.,Musician
Okay. Let's talk.,Robin
"Okay. Oh, hey, you guys want to take five?",Ted
"Thanks, guys. Just need a minute. Sort of a big life decision. Love the blue instruments, though. Kind of an inside joke. Thanks. ",Robin
Right. Come on.,Ted
"It's not that I haven't thought about this. You know that I have, but let's look at this, okay? We only just started being friends again.",Robin
I know. But... come on...,Ted
"And we want different things. That's still there. That's not going away. I mean, what if we do this and it doesn't work out and I'd lose you as a friend? I gotta think about this.",Robin
"Okay, fine. Think about it on the plane. Let's go to Paris for the weekend. I'm serious. I'm kidding. I'm serious.",Ted
"I can't go to Paris, I'm going camping.",Robin
I thought that thing was canceled.,Ted
"Well, it's back on.",Robin
Since when?,Ted
Since like an hour ago.,Robin
"Thanks, Lou, but that blue sky isn't without at least one cloud. I'm sorry to announce that one week from today I will be leaving Metro News One. It has been an honor to bring you the news each night, and read the paper to you each morning. I will always treasure it. Good night, New York.",Sandy
And we're clear.,Man
You're leaving?,Robin
There. I quit my job. We're not coworkers. Will you please have dinner with me? I'm joking. I got offered a job at CNN.,Sandy
"Oh, congratulations.",Robin
Congratulations yourself.,Sandy
What do you mean?,Robin
"Well, Joel asked me who I thought should replace me as lead anchor. I told him you. They're announcing it next week. Act surprised.",Sandy
"Wow. Thanks. And, yes.",Robin
"Yes, what?",Sandy
"Yes, let's go get dinner.",Robin
How about this weekend on the camping trip? I roast a mean weenie.,Sandy
"Oh, you're kidding me. No way. Don't go on this thing.",Ted
"Ted, I have to go. It's a company camping trip.",Robin
Really? Because it also kinda sounds like a date. With Sandy... and his weenie. I mean is this not a date?,Ted
I don't-I don't know.,Robin
"So, what? You actually like this guy now?",Ted
I don't know.,Robin
Are you gonna hook up with him?,Ted
I don't know.,Robin
"Yes, you do.",Ted
"No, Ted, I don't. And you know what? That's okay. I don't plan out every second of my life like you do.",Robin
I don't plan out every...,Ted
"Oh, really? What is all of this? I mean, why can't you just say, Hey, Robin, let's go get some sushi? No, it has to be a-a string quartet and-and Paris and flowers and chocolates and let's spend the rest of our lives together.",Robin
"Don't you think we're a little bit past sushi at this point? God, you are so terrified of anything real. It's like you're floating out in space. Touch the ground, Robin. Live in the world, make a mistake. Make this mistake.",Ted
I need to think about this.,Robin
Fine.,Ted
"No, I'm sorry, I... I can't do this anymore. I need an answer.",Robin
"If you want me to say yes right now, I-I can't do that.",Ted
"Well, if it's not yes, then it's a no.",Robin
Then I guess it's not meant to be.,Ted
"Nice try, buddy.",Barney
Look at the bright side. At least you got some closure. She's made her choice and you can finally move on.,Marshall
Screw that. This ain't over.,Ted
"Ted, you sat here in this very booth and you said...",Marshall
"I don't care what I said. This is gonna happen. She can't say it's not meant to be. It is meant to be, and you know why? 'Cause I mean it to be.",Ted
Unpause?,Lily
Unpause.,Marshall
A painting fellowship?,Marshall
I was never going to take it.,Lily
In California?,Marshall
I was never going to take it.,Lily
"Ted, she is going on that camping trip. Dude, barring some act of God, Robin's gonna be with Sandy this weekend.",Barney
"Fine. If an act of God is what it takes, then an act of God it is.",Ted
What are you talking about?,Barney
I'm gonna make it rain. I can't let Robin go camping with this guy. So how do I keep that from happening? Simple... I make it rain!,Ted
"Ted, do you want me to slap you again? 'Cause I kind of enjoyed it the first time.",Barney
"Look, I-I might be crazy right now... No, you know what? I am definitely crazy right now, but I have a plan. That girl you used to go out with, Penelope, wasn't she getting her PhD in Native American culture?",Ted
Yeah.,Barney
Are you still in touch with her?,Ted
"Sure. I mean, even though we stopped having sex, we still get together, like, once a month to chat and catch up, and of course I'm not in touch with her!",Barney
"Well, you're gonna need to get in touch with her. She's gonna teach me how to do a rain dance.",Ted
Did you just say a rain dance?,Barney
Yes.,Ted
A rain dance.,Barney
Yes.,Ted
A dance to make it rain.,Barney
Yes. ,Ted
"No, we are not!",Barney
"Yes, we are!",Ted
"Ted, you're forcing me to be the voice of reason, and it's not a good look for me!",Barney
Why the hell should I help you?,Penelope
"Come on, I know it didn't work out between us, but we did... have a relationship.",Barney
"We had sex twice in your car, and then you dumped me. How is that a relationship?",Penelope
Twice!,Barney
"Barney, there is no way...",Penelope
Shh!,Barney
"Seriously, come on.",Penelope
"Penelope, I really need to make it rain this weekend.",Ted
Why?,Penelope
There's this girl...,Ted
"There's this girl. You know, the traditional rain dance is a sacred prayer to nature. I don't think the Great Spirit looks too kindly on white dudes who co-opt it to get laid.",Penelope
"Penelope, this is the girl I love. If it doesn't rain this weekend, she's gonna end up with the wrong guy. Please.",Ted
"This wrong guy, is he a huge jackass?",Penelope
Absolutely.,Ted
Kind of like Barney?,Penelope
Kind of.,Ted
Hey.,Barney
You hit on my mom!,Penelope
We weren't exclusive!,Barney
I'm in.,Penelope
Okay. Crouch down and bend over a little bit.,Penelope
"Wow, it took five shots of tequila to get you in that position.",Barney
I will throw you off this roof.,Penelope
There's so much of your mom in you.,Barney
And she's been throwing up ever since.,Robin
So how'd she manage to eat so much chocolate?,Veterinary
"Remember that guy, Ted, that I was telling you about? Well, I came home and I found him waiting in my apartment with a string quartet and roses and chocolates...",Robin
"Oh, that's so sweet.",Veterinary
"Okay, yes, it's sweet in theory, but isn't it also kind of crazy? I mean, a string quartet in my living room... who does that?",Robin
Nobody does that.,Veterinary
Exactly.,Robin
"No, honey... nobody does that. But I guess I'm just a hopeless romantic. I'm gonna put my hand up your dog now.",Veterinary
So you're saying you would forbid me from going?,Lily
"Forbid? Who said forbid? I was just reminding you that there's this wedding coming up in a couple of months, and I was kind of hoping you'd save the day. Look for me... I'll be the guy in the awesome suit. Come on, Lily. It's what you've always wanted.",Marshall
"Yeah, but there's a lot of things I've always wanted, and I haven't done any of them. I'm sorry. I just need to do this before settling down forever.",Lily
So now we've gone from I was never gonna do it to I need to do this? Did I leave the room at some point? When did that happen?,Marshall
"Oh, maybe when you said you wouldn't let me do it.",Lily
"I never said that! You know, if you're having these kind of doubts now, what's gonna change in three months? Maybe we just shouldn't get married at all.",Marshall
Maybe not.,Lily
Pause.,Marshall
"So, are you just, like, starving?",Lily
Totally. Red Lobster?,Marshall
"Oh, lobster, lobster, lobster, you are delicious!",Lily
"Oh, God, I love butter sauce! There's nothing bad about it. Say something bad about butter sauce, I dare you.",Marshall
I wouldn't dare. ,Lily
"Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, happy birthday, happy, happy, happy, happy, appy, happy birthday, happy, happy...",Waiters
"Ted, this is funny. Still funny. Still fu... And now it's sad.",Barney
"Hey, Penelope, you sure I'm doing this right?",Ted
I think so.,Penelope
"Does it, uh, look anything like a real rain dance?",Ted
I think so.,Penelope
"Hey, Penelope, have you, uh, have you ever actually seen a rain dance performed?",Ted
No.,Penelope
No?,Ted
"I've read extensively on the subject: firsthand accounts, theoretical criticism, the anthropological...",Penelope
Have you ever seen a rain dance?,Ted
I've seen a film strip.,Penelope
"Terrific. Uh, look, I should run. I'm getting brain surgery from some guy who's seen a couple episodes of E.R. I can't believe this. We've been up here for the past hour making complete asses of ourselves.",Ted
"What do you mean we, white man?",Penelope
"How did we get here? Couple of days ago, the biggest problem in my life was, did Ted eat the last pudding snack pack in the fridge.",Marshall
I think there's still one left.,Lily
Dibs.,Marshall
Unpause?,Lily
Unpause.,Marshall
Look... I know this sucks. It's just something I'm going through. I'm not asking you to understand it. I'm not asking you to be happy about it. I'm just asking you to support it.,Lily
"I want to, Lily, okay? I really do. But I just can't.",Marshall
Why not?,Lily
"Because you're scaring the hell out of me, that's why not. What if you decide to go be a painter and then you realize I don't fit in to your life anymore, and three months becomes forever? Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?",Marshall
Marshall...,Lily
"'Cause if you can't promise me that, we shoul just break up right now. I'm not gonna wait around for three months just to have my heart ripped out.",Marshall
"Marshall, I love you.",Lily
Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?,Marshall
Pause.,Lily
"No, Lily, we cannot pause this anymore. Can you promise me that that's not gonna happen?!",Marshall
Pause!,Lily
Why do you want me to pause?! (,Marshall
Thank you.,Lily
"Hey, Ted. Whatcha doing?",Barney
A rain dance.,Ted
"Dude, that's not a rain dance, that's a fat kid with a bee in his pants.",Barney
"Look, I highly doubt the Great Spirit is a stickler for choreography. It's the thought that counts. She's leaving in half an hour.",Ted
These are your awesome years. You're wasting them on this girl. This isn't gonna work!,Barney
Yeah. I know that.,Ted
"Well, then why are you doing this?",Barney
"Because I love her. I love her! I told her that the first night we went out, and here it is, eight months later, and nothing's changed. So yes, I know this isn't gonna work. But it has to work! You hear me, universe? This is Ted Mosby talking! Give me some rain! Come on! Come on! Come on...!",Ted
"Oh, come on!",Barney
How about that? He did it.,Barney
"Robin! Hey, Robin! ",Ted
My camping trip got rained out.,Robin
I know. I'm sorry.,Ted
It's not your fault.,Robin
"Yeah, it is. Come down here.",Ted
It's pouring. You come up.,Robin
"No, you have to come down here.",Ted
Why?,Robin
"Why? Because I made it rain, that's what I did today! And that's enough. I-I've done my part. Now, get down here!",Ted
"I'm not dressed, Ted. No. Come up.",Robin
"I'm not coming up there, Robin, I'm not. You have to come down here!",Ted
I was gonna...,Robin
I know.,Ted
"OK, where was I? It was June 2006 and life had just taken an unexpected turn.",Ted
"Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important. It's all part of the story.",Ted
"No. The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful. For me, it started out great. ",Ted
So that's it? We're breaking up?,Marshall
"Marshall, I'm sorry. I just... I just need to go to San Francisco and do this art program and figure out who I am outside of us. And the only way that I can do that is if we don't talk for a while.",Lily
"For a while? Try never, OK? You walk out that door and we're done. You're never gonna hear my voice again.",Marshall
I should call her.,Marshall
"No! No! If you call her, when she asked you not to, you're just gonna look weak and you're gonna regret it. Now, listen. Whenever you feel like calling her, you come find me first... and I will punch you in the face.",Ted
You're a good friend Ted.,Marshall
"Hey! So, did you hear the big news?",Robin
"You mean how Lily and Marshall broke up and Lily is gone and nothing else even remotely important happened last night? Yeah, I think he knows.",Ted
Oh my god! I... I'm so sorry. What happened?,Robin
"Well, she left. And I don't even know if she's coming back.",Marshall
"I didn't get your message until I woke up. Bro, I am so sorry.",Barney
Thanks.,Marshall
I know it must be tough. But are you ready to hear something that will not only make you feel better but will actively excite you?,Barney
Sure.,Marshall
"For the first time ever, the three of us are single at the same time. I've dreamed about this day boys and it's going to be legendary! Together, we will own this city. Any time, a girl wants to get back at her ex-boyfriend, we'll be there. Any time a girl wants to solve her father issues through promiscuity and binge-drinking, we will be there. Any time a bachelorette party drives through the city in a limo sticking their heads out, shouting What's up New York? we will be what is up New York! Gentlemen, we are about to embark on... ",Barney
Hey Marshall.,Ted
Hey Ted.,Marshall
Are you hungry?,Ted
"What's the point? I could it some food, it's just gonna leave me.",Marshall
"At least in that scenario, you get to do the dumping. Come on, it's Sunday, it's pancakes day!",Ted
"Lily always made the pancakes. God, I loved her pancakes. So soft. So warmed. So perfectly shaped.",Marshall
"Are we still talking about her pancakes? Come on, you gotta eat something. What can I get you?",Ted
Beer.,Marshall
"No, that's what you had for dinner.",Ted
Fine. Than I'll just have the leftover,Marshall
"So he stays home all the time not getting laid? No, see, that's what you do when you have a fianc√©e. He should be down here celebrating. He's free. He got that red-head-tumor removed.",Barney
You should write and illustrate children's books.,Ted
"You know what Marshall needs to do? He needs to stop being sad. When I get sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead. True story.",Barney
"It's only been a month. He just needs to goat his own pace. Anyway, lily is the one who caused this whole mess.",Ted
"Hey, cut her some slack! She's our friend too. She's just trying to figure out who she is.",Robin
"Figure out who she is? She should call me. I got a whole list. She's selfish, she's immature, she's...",Ted
What?,Robin
"God, your eyes are so blue.",Ted
Teddy bear... ,Robin
"So, I find her shampoo. I guess she left it here. It smells like her. Like lavender and seashells. Hope. Somehow erotic and comforting all at the same time.",Marshall
That's my shampoo.,Robin
Oh. Sorry.,Marshall
I thought he's never go to sleep.,Robin
Uh-oh.,Ted
Already?,Robin
He's calling her. Dammit!,Ted
I don't hear anyth...Ted ,Robin
"Oh! OK, you're right. I won't call her. I will not call her.",Marshall
"Well, I called her. And get this, she changed her number. Well like I'm gonna stalk her or something? Like she's so special?! Like she's the only Lily Aldrin out there? 'Cause there are four others in the San Francisco area alone, and they all seem a lot better than her, based on the brief conversations I had with them!",Marshall
"Yeah. Hey Robin. Anyway, one of the Lily Adrins...",Marshall
"This has to stop! Ted, we just started dating. We agreed we don't wanna move too fast and yet somehow we have a baby. He can't feed himself, he cries a lot, he keeps us up all night...",Robin
Have you tried breast-feeding? Nailed it!,Barney
They were together nine years. It's only been a month and a half. He just needs to go his own pace.,Ted
He slept on our floor last night Ted.,Robin
He watched a scary movie.,Ted
It is time for some tough love. We need to get him out of that apartment. He needs fresh air. He needs sunshine.,Robin
Mmm. Sunshine.,Barney
"Gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Sunshine!",Man
"Barney, I really don't think this is gonna help.",Marshall
"Do you know why you're not over Lily yet? It's 'cause you can still picture her naked. You can't get over a woman until you can no longer picture her boobs. It's a scientific fact. The average male brain can only store a finite number of boob images, or BPEGs and your hard drive's filled to capacity with Lily's.",Barney
There are a lot of them.,Marshall
"They won't go away until you overwrite them with images of other women's boobs. Now, this journey may take as many as a million boobs so we begin here tonight my friend. Two at the time. Those count as four.",Barney
"Yeah, this is fun, right? We're outside, it's a beautiful day. The Indians are winning!",Ted
"I gotta admit, it is really nice to be outside.",Marshall
"Yankee's fans, please turn your attention to the Diamond Vision for a special seventh-inning-stretch surprise.",Man
"Oh, no. ",Ted
"It's all a big lie! She's just gonna break your heart!  You can drag me outta here, but she has no soul!",Marshall
"We've tried everything. Baseball, strippers. The guy still won't eat a damn pancake. I think he's beyond repair.",Ted
"See, this is the problem with guys, you don't know how to deal with heartbreak.",Robin
"So what's your prescription, Dr Oestrogen? Eat H&amp;auml;agen-Dazs and Watch Love actually until your periods sync up? ",Barney
"Yeah, that's the stuff.",Robin
Oh my God! How long have you been doing this?,Marshall
"My Dad taught me to sh**t when I was a kid. Now, whenever I'm feeling lonely or depressed, I come here and it reminds me that... g*n are fun!",Robin
"Um, you know, Ted is kinda against g*n.Robin ",Marshall
"Only hell, yes. Oh yeah, yeah. This is what I needed. I felt so powerless this whole time but this... This is power, this is... ",Marshall
I should have mention the recoil.,Robin
"I'll hand it to you. When he got home, Marshall was smiling. Did you sleep with him? 'Cause I was actually like three days away from suggesting that.",Ted
"Sometimes, all you need is to get in touch with your feminine side. ",Robin
"Well, congratulations. You're the first person to cheer him up all summer. You win.",Ted
Oh! What do I win?,Robin
I'll tell what you win. I'm taking you away this weekend.,Ted
You are? That's so nice!,Robin
"My aunt and uncle have a beach house at Montauk. It's really romantic. My uncle had, like, three affairs there.",Ted
"Wow, it must be a nice house. I saw pictures of your uncle. This is so great. We'll finally get some time alone. Are you sure Marshall is gonna be OK with this?",Robin
"Yeah sure. Absolutely. Dude, I'm doing much better. In fact, take my car.",Marshall
"Really? Hey, thanks. And hey, if you need anything, day or night, just call me. You know what? Please don't call me. What? What's wrong?",Ted
It's Lily's credit card bill. She must have forgotten to switch her address.,Marshall
So?,Ted
I wonder what kind of charges she's making out there.,Marshall
"No, no. No good can come from looking at this. You've made too much progress already.",Ted
"I know, but I just...",Marshall
"August 5, one charge - tickets. To what? George Clinton and the P-Funk All Stars. August 10, one charge, Tennis Emporium. August 18, two charges. Mario's bistro and - get this - Pet Palace. You guys see what it means right?",Marshall
"Wow, Mario's bistro. What a perfect place to whore around.",Lily
"Oh funk legend George Clinton, I am so glad you spotted me at your concert an drag me on stage to dance with you Courteney Cox style.",Lily
"Oh you know, Marshall tried to get me to play tennis for nine years but I didn't do it because I never truly loved him.",Lily
"Oh! A ferret. I'll buy it some food next door at the Pet Palace. I've always wanted one, but Marshall have this secret phobia of ferrets.",Lily
"It was! Oh, I love you funk legend George Clinton.",Lily
That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.,Ted
"Yeah. Why are you afraid of ferrets, they are adorable.",Robin
"Because, Robin, they are like fuzzy tube-shaped rats.",Marshall
Those charges are from a month ago.,Barney
Exactly!,Ted
"For new charges, you have to go to her online account. You can see credit card activity from like two hours ago. But... You know... Don't... ",Barney
Why do you talk? Why do you talk?,Ted
"He needs her password. Its not like he has her password. Ooh, he has her password. This is... He has her password.",Barney
"There is a charge from earlier today. The Kellet Hotel, on Fifth. I don't believe this. Lily is back in New-York.  I can't believe this. Lily's in New-York? I guess I'd been thinking when she got back she's call me. That's the only reason I've been able to hold it together so far this summer.",Marshall
"OK, you know what? I'm calling her.",Marshall
No! You're not calling her. This changes nothing. ,Ted
You want me to baby-sit him? 20 bucks. An hour. And money for pizza.,Barney
Um yeah. How about you do it for free or every time we hang out you have to watch this. ,Ted
"OK, I'll do it! Stop being a couple.",Barney
Marshall!,Robin
Marshall! Marshall!,Ted
"Ted, I know I shouldn't do this but I have to!",Marshall
Everything we've worked so hard for...!,Ted
"Hello, Lily Aldrin's room please. Thank you.",Marshall
Hang up now!,Ted
"Ted, I can't hang up now.",Marshall
Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up now! Hang up!,Ted
Hello?! ,Marshall
No!,Barney
"Dude, you can't...",Ted
I have to go down there and I have to tell her I love her. I have to beg to take me back even if I have to tell on my knees.,Marshall
"Marshall, you can't do that!",Robin
Really? Why not?,Marshall
"Because you're pathetic! I'm sorry. But right now, you are not Marshall. You are the miserable, whining, shampoo-sniffing ghost of Marshall and frankly, a guy like you doesn't have a sh*t in hell with a girl like Lily. You know who might have a sh*t somewhere down the line? Marshall. The real Marshall. But if you go down there now like this, you'll blow it for him and he's never gonna forgive you. Of course, whatever I say, you just will do the opposite so, have a great weekend, good luck screwing up your life. Come on, Robin... Is it still OK if we borrow the car?",Ted
Bold. Bold to go for the car.,Barney
What?,Ted
I didn't say a thing.,Robin
You think I was too hard on him.,Ted
I didn't say a thing.,Robin
I can't believe you're accusing me to be too hard on him. You're the one who said tough love.,Ted
"Yeah, tough love, not hand the guy a noose.",Robin
"Oh, but it's OK to hand him a 9 mm? Yeah. He told me. So you're a g*n nut?",Ted
"No, I'm a g*n enthusiast.",Robin
Do you know how many people are k*ll...,Ted
The Second Amendment protects my right to bear arms...,Robin
"Alright, alright. I was too hard on him.",Ted
A little.,Robin
"I'm gonna call Barney, see how they're doing.",Ted
Barney.,Barney
"Uh, hey. Where are you guys?",Ted
We're at a fundraiser helping young women raise money for college.,Barney
Strip-club. Nice. Is Marshall OK?,Ted
"Yeah, he's here and he's great. Hang on. Marshall, tell Ted... Uh-oh.",Barney
Already?,Stripper
What? What uh-oh?,Ted
He's gone.,Barney
You lost him? I can't believe it! He's gonna go down to that hotel.,Ted
"Crap, you're right. OK, here is the plan. Here is the plan. You go down to the hotel and find him. I'll stay here and get a lap dance. Bye Ted!",Barney
Barney!,Ted
Is there a hot tube at your uncle's place?,Robin
A really nice one.,Ted
"Hi. Uh, could you tell me what room Lily Aldrin's in? Thanks. Marshall!",Ted
Hey.,Marshall
What happened?,Ted
"Well, I went up to Lily's floor...",Marshall
"...and I had this little speech in my head. Everything I've been wanting to say to her all summer about love, loyalty, respect. I knocked on the door. ",Marshall
You knocked out Lily's new boyfriend?,Ted
Yeah. It wasn't Lily's boyfriend.,Marshall
What? Who was he?,Ted
"Oh, this is so embarrassing. I could've sworn I have some change. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Oh, here we go. No that's, that's a button... It was a button. Do you take credit cards?",Lily
"So Lily is not back in town and she doesn't have a boyfriend. That's good news, right?",Ted
Yeah. I don't know. Those credit card charges were the only remaining connection I had to her. I don't know where she is or what she's doing. She was my whole life man and now she's... She's gone.,Marshall
"You know, first day at college, I showed up, I was so freaked out and I got up to my room and there was my roommate, lying on the bed with his feet up on the wall. He had headphones on, a big smile on his face like he just didn't give a crap. Happy. Confident. Not afraid of anything. That guy was you. You before you met Lily.",Ted
Ted.,Marshall
Yeah.,Ted
I was high that day. I was. I was so high I thought you were the dean.,Marshall
"What I'm saying is, there's a version of you without Lily and... It's not this. You can't let Lily stole your identity the way that guy stole hers.",Ted
"OK.OK! Resolved. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to start being OK. Cheers.",Marshall
Cheers.,Ted
Ted. Ted you should see this.,Robin
"Oh, what now? Marshall? What are you doing?",Ted
It's Sunday. It's pancakes day.,Marshall
"Alright, see you guys later.",Robin
I'll walk you out.,Ted
See ya.,Marshall
You just checked out Robin's ass.,Barney
"What? No. I... Barney, I was...",Marshall
"Dude, that's awesome! You're finally forgetting about that short redhead.",Barney
Lily.,Marshall
"Yes, Lily, thank you. That was gonna drive me crazy all night. Hey, Ted! Marshall's just checked out your girlfriend's ass.",Barney
I did not Ted...,Marshall
Awesome! You're finally getting better.,Ted
"This is the moment I've been waiting for. Starting tonight, I'm gonna teach you how to live. Ted, you're out of chance, Marshall's in.",Barney
Yes!,Ted
"Oh, God!",Marshall
"Marshall, being a single guy in New York city is like... Pfff... What does everybody like?",Barney
Candy.,Marshall
Yeah! It's like being in a candy store. You just walk right in and grab yourself some Whoppers. Yeah. Is Whoppers the best ones?,Barney
Mounds.,Ted
Milk Duds.,Barney
Gobstoppers.,Ted
Um...,Barney
Dubble Bubbles.,Ted
"Nice! Marshall, we're doing this. I am not taking no for an answer.",Barney
Fine.,Marshall
"Ted, what is wrong with you?",Marshall
Lily.,Robin
It is a great ass.,Lily
Your hair is adorable!,Robin
Thank you! ,Lily
Hi. Have you met Marshall?,Barney
Hi.,Woman
"Hi. Look how sweaty my hands are! It's weird, right? Uh, sweat. Like this... Smelly water coming out of your skin. It was nice meeting you.",Marshall
"I-I-I Hate to interrupt but, uh... Do you like magic?",Barney
Umm... I guess. ,Woman
"Dude, you were awesome last night. You were charming, you were funny. You were totally working that girl.",Barney
You went home with her!,Marshall
"Yes, I did. But she told me that if it wasn't for me you would've had a sh*t with her. So in hypothetical terms, you scored last night! All right! Hypothetical high five! Nice! Tonight, we're gonna go to the bar...",Barney
"Barney, no, I'm not going out with you ever again.",Marshall
Come on! I'll teach you all my strategies!,Barney
"Oh, really?",Marshall
"My favorite, number seven. Create a mystery about yourself. That way, they become so intrigued that they have to hang out with you all night.",Barney
"Oh, come on. Does that really work?",Marshall
Maybe it does and maybe it doesn't.,Barney
"Dammit that's intriguing! OK, I'm in.",Marshall
You've gotta hear this.,Robin
You will not believe what just happened.,Ted
You go first.,Robin
I find a 1939 penny on the subway. Just imagine the history this little copper guy's seen...,Ted
Lily is back in town.,Robin
And you let me go first?! Have you seen her?,Ted
"Uh, yeah. I actually went apartment hunting with her today.",Robin
How is she doing?,Ted
You're not gonna like it.,Robin
"I am doing great. This summer, best thing ever. San Francisco is so happening right now.",Lily
She's happy? Marshall had the worst summer of his life and she's happy. And I suppose her art program was fulfilling or whatever.,Ted
"Oh, the art program, best thing ever.",Lily
"Oh my God, this is your best work. In all my years teaching, I've never seen anything so... Needless to say, this is art! I can't teach you anything. ",Man
"But the best part of SF - oh that's what we call San Francisco - the people. Even just riding around on the bus all summer, it was like a human tapestry.",Lily
I'm Paula. I sing in a punk band for children. Yeah!,Woman
"Wow, I am so happy for you.",Robin
"Oh, she's such a... godda... God! After what she did to Marshall, she should come back here devastated. Crawling over the broken glass of her own shame and regret.",Ted
You never chose sides. I respect that.,Robin
She's unbelievable! Unbelievable!,Ted
Unbelievable? What's unbelievable?,Marshall
"Uh, listen Marshall...",Ted
Ted found a penny on the subway and it's old and that's interesting.,Robin
Way to go.,Marshall
"OK, first of all, that is interesting. Second, we have to tell him.",Ted
"No, we don't. He's just starting to get better. Going out with Barney. How do you think he'll feel when he hears Lily's moved on?",Robin
She's moved on?,Ted
"Well, it happens. I've fallen out of love faster than that before. Sometimes, boom, with no warning whatsoever. One day we're in love, the next day, he's dead to me. But we're great! Honey?",Robin
Let's review Barney's rules for mating without dating. Lesson two: corollary five.,Barney
Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and unattractive and she'll be putty in your hands.,Marshall
Excellent. Have you chosen your entr√©e?,Barney
"I have. A sweet brunette, eight o'clock. Nine o'clock. Ten; thirty. She's walking to the bar.",Marshall
"Her? Really? No, you're right. Ambition is the enemy of success. OK, hit it.",Barney
"Hi Marshall. Amy. Don't worry, I've been there. Hold on.",Girl
Nice recovery. I think it's working.,Barney
"Um, Amy, this is my friend Barney. Barney, this is Amy.",Marshall
"Hey Barney, nice to meet you.",Amy
"Hi. Amy, do you like... magic?",Barney
I hate you.,Marshall
I am so sorry. It's a sickness. I'm the real v*ctim here.,Barney
Twice! Twice in a row you took my candy! That was my candy!,Marshall
I know but tonight...,Barney
"No, forget it. You're such a jackass!",Marshall
"OK, but no magic. ",Marshall
"I'm taking a leak, dumb-ass.",Barney
"But I need the freedom to really chase my passion, which was painting but now, I think it's music, or spoken words. Maybe both. God, isn't life amazing.",Lily
Yeah.,Ted
It is so great to see you Ted. Ah! I'm gonna get the key for the lockbox.,Lily
What?,Robin
"She's miserable. She's realized she's made a huge mistake. Her and Marshall will be back together in a week, I love it!",Ted
"No, you just want Lily to be miserable. The truth is she's happy.",Robin
Trust me. I've known Lily for nine years.,Ted
"Trust me, I'm a girl!",Robin
Yeah. But you're Canadian.,Ted
Why do you always have to bring that up?,Robin
You're our weird neighbors!,Ted
You bring it up every time...,Robin
"No, alright. Five bucks says she still wants Marshall.",Ted
You're on.,Robin
Five American bucks.,Ted
"Dammit! OK, so how do we get the truth out of her?",Robin
"Tequila. It's her weakness. Three shots, she tells you the truth about anything.",Ted
"Marshall Eriksen, suit up!",Barney
No way.,Marshall
Yeah you're good in that. Let's go.,Barney
Wait. Empty your pockets. Come on.,Marshall
Come on...,Barney
Sleeves.,Marshall
There is nothing in my sl...,Barney
Oh is that right?,Marshall
Huh? Huh? Let's go.,Barney
Behind my ear.,Marshall
Oh there is nothing behind your... Ohh!,Barney
Ohh!,Marshall
"Yeah, I'm in pre-law. The workload's k*ll me though.",Girl
"Oh, tell me about it. I'm a third year at Columbia Law, so... If the workload does k*ll you I can probably get a conviction. Yeah.",Marshall
"Listen, I gotta go. But it'd be great to see you again.",Girl
"Yes, it would. It really would.",Marshall
Maybe I'll see you here sometimes.,Girl
"Probably not. I'm never here, so...",Marshall
"You know, I do have a phone number.",Girl
Great. Nice.,Marshall
"Hi, I'm Barney.",Barney
"Oh, no.",Marshall
Do you mind giving my friend your phone number?,Barney
Sure.,Girl
"Whoo! I did it! I got a girl's phone number! Oh, and her handwriting is so cute. Look. I'll take her out for Chinese food and then we'll walk through the park. It'll be so... What?",Marshall
"Sorry buddy, I'm taking this one too.",Barney
"And then I discovered this area, North beach. Best beach ever! Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer. How are you guys doing? And hey, how is Marshall?",Lily
Gimme the card! I swear I'm gonna...,Marshall
I'm not giving you...,Barney
Terrific.,Ted
That is so good to hear. ,Lily
"OK, we're way past truth-telling Lily and about to hit Cinco-de-Mayo-1998 Lily, and I'm not cleaning that up again. So, congratulations. You win, she's happy.",Ted
I didn't get it. That first apartment. I... I waited too long and somebody else got it. ,Lily
"Interesting. Wow Lily, you, uh, seem to be having a pretty strong reaction to losing this apartment. I wonder is it because it reminds you of something you lost because you couldn't commit?",Ted
"No, Lily you're crying over the crown moulding and the real hardwood floor. There's no deeper meaning, right Lily? Just quit crying and tell him.",Robin
The apartment is a metaphor for Marshall! ,Lily
Stop it!,Barney
You don't want to see me when I'm angry!,Marshall
"Stop! If we can't settle this like gentlemen, then no one gets the number. ",Barney
Stop the cab! ,Marshall
"No, wait. Come on. Wait. Marshall! 81st and 1st please. ",Barney
"Morning guys, what can I get you?",Waiter
"Shhh! Bring me the dirtiest, greasiest tuna melt you got. And a milkshake.",Lily
"For you, sir?",Waiter
Gravy.,Ted
You want that gravy on something?,Waiter
Surprise me.,Ted
I'd take you with gravy if my boyfriend wasn't sitting right here! Just kidding. I'm good.,Robin
What are you charpy about?,Lily
She's still drunk from last night.,Ted
I don't think so! Whoo!,Robin
"Look, if you want Marshall back so bad, how come it took you two days to ask about him?",Ted
I was dying to ask. I was just trying to play it cool. But really...,Lily
"But it's good, I mean work's great...",Robin
Say something about Marshall. Where is Marshall? How's Marshall? What's Marshall doing right now? ,Lily
It was such an awful summer! I just wanted to get back here and see him.,Lily
But I thought your summer was great?!,Ted
Not exactly...,Lily
Oh my God! This is your best work?! In all my years teaching I've never seen something so... needless. To say this is art... I can't teach you anything.,Man
So all those interesting people you met on the bus...?,Ted
"Yeah, um...",Lily
I'm Mike. I'm a Buddhist monk slash adventure writer travel.,Man
"I never got in touch because I was too embarrassed. I screwed everything up. I have no job, no place to live. I lost the love of my life. Look, I know I have no right to ask this but do you think Marshall would take me back?",Lily
"In a b*at. If you called him up, yeah, he'd take you back with open arms.",Ted
"Wow. So, maybe I should call him?",Lily
"Maybe. No! This is... Ooww... Hold on. Look. If you're gonna go back to him, I don't wanna hear the word maybe. Maybe cannot be in your vocabulary. This break-up almost k*ll him. And he cannot go through it again. So, unless you're absolutely certain, stay the hell away from him.",Ted
Hi Marshall.,Barney
"No, go away, I don't want to talk to you.",Marshall
"OK. I know what I did a couple nights back was is in a moral grey area. But the great news is she loved you. If things had gone your way, you'd gone out a couple time, I think she definitely would've had sex with you.",Barney
"There is no would in sex. There totally is. I'm just no good at this Barney! I'm good at being in a couple. I'm good at being Lily's boyfriend. Being single, forget it.",Marshall
"You can't give up now. What if I told you that you could relive that night with the exact same conversations, the exact same jokes, only this time you get her and I don't.",Barney
That's not possible.,Marshall
"Oh, but it is. She has... Wait for it. Here it comes. Almost there...an identical twin. Yes!",Barney
A twin isn't the same person.,Marshall
"Of course, it is. What do you think identical means? Ident- - same. -ical - person. Same person. Hey, we could double date.",Barney
Fine.,Marshall
Ah!,Barney
"But you have to promise me you're not gonna steal my new twin and leave me with your old, used-up twin.",Marshall
Used-up? They're a human being Marshall.,Barney
How are you doing?,Barney
Great. Amazing. This is so much fun. Me and the girl are really cliking.,Marshall
"You are. You definitely are. Listen, you're gonna have to leave now. I just talked with the twins and, get this, I'm going home with both of them! Yeah. That's happening.",Barney
It is impossible that you're doing this to me again.,Marshall
But they're twins.,Barney
You said to me that being single would be like being in a candy store.,Marshall
"Well, it's not like a candy store. It's a lawless, post-apocalyptic wasteland. I may be your best friend...",Barney
Ted's my best friend.,Marshall
"...but in this world it's every hombre for himself. That's what being single is. And after nine years of captivity, that is the single greatest lesson I can teach you about surviving in the wild. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have two unique breasts an two duplicates waiting for me. ",Barney
Yeah. I guess we're just a threesome tonight.,Barney
Lily. What are you doing here?,Marshall
"Oh, I-I was just walking by. I wasn't... Oh, you mean, New-York? My program ended. It was just great. Just lots of fun. It was awful. It was the worst mistake I ever made. I'm so sorry Marshall. And, hello.",Lily
"Lily, this was the worst summer of my life.",Marshall
I know. It was the worst summer of my life.,Lily
It was the hardest thing I've ever had to go through.,Marshall
Can we please get back together?,Lily
"All that crap you said to me about we need to figure out who we are outside of us, and we need to learn to do things on our own.. It broke my heart. Three months ago, you broke my heart.",Marshall
Can we please get back together?,Lily
"Lily, you were right. All that crap was right. So, no. No, we can't get back together. We shouldn't. At least, not right now.",Marshall
Wow. OK. Yeah. Wi... Will we still see each other?,Lily
Yeah. Yeah. I think so. I don't know. This is all really new to me. I just got out of a long relationship. I like your hair.,Marshall
"Thanks. I, uh, figured, new city, new color - uh, old color. ",Lily
Yeah.,Marshall
"Listen, if there is anything I can do to even begin to make things up to you.",Lily
"Actually, there's maybe something you can do for me. But you can never ever ask me why.",Marshall
"So then, I was promoted to assistant m√©nage-er. Manager. Why do I keep doing that? ",Barney
"You gave me Chlamydia, you jerk! ",Lily
"So, where was I? Ah yes. Assistant m√©nage-er. I did it again. I can't believe it!",Barney
You gave my twin sister Chlamydia! You slime! ,Lily
"Wait, wait, I know magic. Well played, Eriksen. Well played.",Barney
"Kids you know that photo in the den? It was taken back in 2006, when Grandma and Grandpa came to visit me and we all went out to brunch. We all look pretty happy, right? Wrong.",Ted
I wish your face would melt off.,Lily
I wish your eyeballs would explode.,Marshall
I hate you.,Lily
I hate you more.,Marshall
I'm going to k*ll him.,Ted
I can't say I blame you.,Barney
"No, I mean I'm seriously going to k*ll him.",Ted
I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.,Robin
"Okay, if you don't, I will.",Robin
You mean the spa the judge ordered him to go to to quit cocaine?,Ted
"Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Mosby.",Lily
Good to see you.,Marshall
I was just stopping by to pick up some of my things.,Lily
Lily calling off the wedding and dumping me?,Marshall
Me begging Marshall to take me back and him rejecting me?,Lily
"Actually, we're cool. We just divided up CDs. It was all very civil. I'm proud of us. Wwe're, we're good.",Marshall
What?,Marshall
"Well, I-I don't want to go if it would make you uncomfortable.",Lily
Why would it?,Marshall
"Well, I mean, yeah, we're... We're good, but you got to admit there's that stuff between us.",Lily
"Um, not for me. Now it's just like we're friends. It's like we're brother and sister.",Marshall
"Brother and sister?! Okay. Fine, yeah, I'll see you at the restaurant, bro. ",Lily
"Hello, everyone.",Lily
Hi.,All
"Hello, Marshall.",Lily
"Oh, thanks. It's kind of revealing, but I thought, Hey, we're all family. Right, bro? Ooh, ah...",Lily
What's wrong?,Ted
"Oh, I, I hurt my ankle in yoga today. The instructor told me to just take deep breaths to get through the pain, just... ",Lily
"No, I'm fine. It's just... This roll is really spicy.",Marshall
"Lily is evil! She just wore that dress to torture me. Well, you know what? Two can play at that game. See, at brunch, I'm going to torture Lily right back. Yeah. There's a part of my body that she's got a weakness for, too.",Marshall
"Dude, you can't whip that out at brunch.",Barney
"No, not that. I'm going to unleash my calves.",Marshall
That's crazy. Nobody's turned on by men's calves. They're a thoroughly unerotic body part.,Barney
"Well, yeah, I'd say that, too, if I had those skinny little chicken legs.",Marshall
I'll be waiting by the phone for your apology.,Barney
Hello.,Marshall
"Hey, Marshall.",Ted
Hey.,Robin
Hey. How are you feeling? You looked kind of feverish last night.,Lily
"Oh, no, I actually feel great. It is kind of warm in here, though, isn't it?",Marshall
"Oh, I don't know, if anything, it's kind of... (",Lily
"Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. I'm just making myself feel a little bit more... comfortable. ",Marshall
Take off your dress.,Marshall
Take off the rest of your pants.,Lily
I really wasn't expecting that to happen.,Lily
"Yeah, me neither. It kind of complicates things, doesn't it?",Marshall
"Yeah, it does. Why did you have to throw your magnificent calves at me? You know you have a punter's leg.",Lily
"Well, why did you have to throw your beautiful boobs at me? You know you have... boobs.",Marshall
"Just admit it, you came here trying to seduce me.",Lily
Seduce you? You seduced me.,Marshall
You sat down next to me and took most of your pants off.,Lily
You went to San Francisco for three months.,Marshall
How is that seducing you?,Lily
"Well, it's not but I'm still mad about it.",Marshall
"All right, that's it - I want The b*at Anthology.",Lily
"Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm keeping it! And you know the U2 box set I gave you? Look inside - all Dave Matthews.",Marshall
You are evil.,Lily
I'm going to k*ll him.,Ted
I can't say I blame you.,Barney
"No, I mean I'm seriously going to k*ll him.",Ted
"Barney, what are you doing here?",Ted
Uh... I'm here to meet your parents. They must be dying to meet me after all the legendary Barney stories you've told them.,Barney
I haven't told them any legendary Barney stories.,Ted
What?,Barney
"Barney, here is a list of all the things I talk with my dad about&#058; baseball.",Ted
But I'm your best friend.,Barney
"Well, actually Marshall's my...",Ted
I'm the most important person in your life.,Barney
"Well, Robin's actually...",Ted
How could your parents not know about me? I'm delightful.,Barney
"To us, sure, in very small, infrequent doses. I mean, come on, you're not exactly the kind of friend parents want their kid to have.",Robin
"Oh, really? Then I guess those shoes aren't the thing you're most wrong about today.",Barney
"Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.",Ted
I know you've all been excited to meet...,Ted
Barney Stinson. An honor to meet the two of you. That needlepoint Bless This Mess pillow you made for Ted - what a stitch. Stitch! Did that just happen? ,Barney
"Uh, Mom, Dad, this is my girlfriend, Robin.",Ted
Hello.,Robin
"That's funny, I didn't even look in the mirror today. That's not anything, is it? So, I made a reservation at San Marino tonight for 8:00.",Robin
I know.,Barney
How are we supposed to get a table at Casa A Pezzi? They're booked for weeks.,Robin
"Well, lucky for you, I happen to know the head waitress, which is ironic because...",Barney
"Stop it! Don't, don't!",Ted
"Ironic because we both work at a homeless shelter where I serve the food. Where do you volunteer, Robin?",Barney
"What's the matter with you? I'm his girlfriend, and I'm not even trying that hard. Way to wreck the curve, kiss-ass.",Robin
"Robin, I'm his best friend. That's a commitment. Girlfriend? That's like a bad flu. Out of your system after a couple weeks in bed. High five!",Barney
"Yes, you can, Virginia. There's a story behind that broach, and I'm going to hear it.",Barney
"No, Virginia, you're delightful, I am deligh-ted. And he's just Ted. I'm really not planning these things; they just keep happening.",Barney
"Whoops. I think I dropped an ice cube down here. Ow, it's so cold.",Lily
"All right, that's it, I'm out of here. In a minute.",Marshall
Anyone up for a drink at MacLaren's?,Barney
"No, I'm kind of tired.",Robin
"Me, too.",Lily
"Yeah, I'm sure my folks are gonna want...",Ted
Cervezas? Did he fall?,Ted
"St. Peter's, 8:45 a.m., it's my favorite service.",Barney
Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?,Ted
I'll save you a seat.,Barney
Robin.,Robin
"Susan, her name is Virginia.",Barney
"Dude, I am sincerely ticked at your dad right now.",Barney
Why?,Ted
"Last night, we go to MacLaren's for a drink, right?",Barney
Wow. You're like a hero.,Girl
"Oh, I'm no hero, Wendy. You know who is a hero? My Dalmatian, Smokey. He... didn't... make it out. I'm sorry.",Barney
"You poor, brave man.",Girl
I'm... oh. ,Barney
"My dad was your wingman? This is really messing with my head. Barney, is... Is my dad cool?",Ted
"I'm not done. So, your dad stays to finish his drink, but I take off because I have to be up early for Mass with your mom.",Barney
Sure.,Ted
"Anyway, I realize that I left my phone on the bar, so I come back...",Barney
"Oh, my God! Is that really...? Oh, my God!",Ted
I know. Can you believe your dad rack-jacked me like that?,Barney
"My dad made out with Wendy the waitress? He cheated on my mom? No, that's impossible.",Ted
"Ted, it's a well-known statistic that 83% of people married longer than six months are seeing someone on the side.",Barney
"Do you know that when you make up a statistic, you always use 83%?",Ted
"You think I'm lying. Well, have you done any surveys on the subject? Because the good people at www.swingers.open-marriage-is-natural-legalize-polygamy.org have, and they beg to differ.",Barney
That's not a real Web site.,Ted
"Oh, and I suppose I didn't get a real T-shirt for running in their 10K.",Barney
"Hi, Dad.",Ted
Enjoying your vacation so far?,Ted
"Uh, listen, can I speak to you outside for a sec?",Ted
So you went out with Barney last night?,Ted
You have a good time?,Ted
Yeah. So...,Ted
Well...,Ted
You think Cerrano's got a sh*t at the RBI title?,Ted
"I wanted to confront him, but I couldn't. I guess I got the let's-not-talk-about-anything-uncomfortable gene",Ted
"Well, you didn't get your dad's close-the-deal gene, that's for sure.",Barney
I don't care how unpleasant it is. You have to talk to him.,Robin
"Okay, if you don't, I will.",Robin
One last thing about my mom. She grills every single one of my girlfriends about when we're gonna get married and have kids.,Ted
But this is the first time she's meeting me.,Robin
Doesn't matter. And you'll know it's coming when she mentions my cousin Stacy: six kids in five years. The woman's basically a ride at a water park.,Ted
But I don't want to get married and have kids. What am I supposed to say?,Robin
You know what? You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions. You shouldn't have to apologize for them.,Ted
I'm gonna lie.,Robin
I would.,Ted
Thanks again for letting me have the U2 box set.,Lily
I know how important it is to you.,Marshall
"Oh, good for her.",Ted
"Oh, boy.",Robin
I'm just not ready.,Robin
"Oh. Uh, I thought you, um... It's great.",Robin
"Ooh, a piano!",Barney
"You lucked out with my mom last night, huh? What a relief, right?",Ted
"Oh, absolutely. Whew, what a relief it is to know I'm the one girlfriend your mom doesn't want you to have kids with.",Robin
Hooray?,Ted
"I mean, did she really think that your college girlfriend Cheryl would pop out attractive children? 'Cause I've seen pictures, and, I'm sorry, that girl had a brow ridge like a caveman.",Robin
"Come on, she was just frowning under direct light. And besides, that's not even what I liked about her. It was her... It's not important.",Ted
What happened to Marshall and Lily?,Barney
They've been fighting lately. They're probably off somewhere going at it.,Ted
More coffee?,Waitress
"Well, if she's so sweet, maybe she should have Ted's babies.",Robin
Nothing. ,Robin
Just a minute.,Lily
Maybe less.,Marshall
Why don't you want me to have your grandkids?,Robin
"No! I mean, I don't know. I just... I want you to want me to want to have your grandkids. And you should. I'm a genetic gold mine. No family history of diabetes or heart disease. Everyone has nonporous teeth and perfect eyesight. I had one schizophrenic uncle but even he had perfect vision. Which was unfortunate for the people around the bell tower he was in, but still he was a very fine man, and...",Robin
Excuse me. Sorry. Didn't know that there was a line.,Marshall
"Marshall, your zipper.",Lily
"Why do you say that? I mean, you got married pretty young. That wasn't a mistake. Was it?",Robin
Smile!,Waitress
I wish your face would melt off.,Lily
I wish your eyeballs would explode.,Marshall
I'm gonna k*ll him.,Ted
"I don't care how unpleasant it is, you have to talk to him.",Robin
"Okay, if you don't, I will.",Robin
"Sweetheart? Sweetheart?! The only sweetheart in your life should be the woman you married 30 years ago, not the waitress at the bar last night and not this clumsy floozy! ",Ted
"Dad? You, uh, want to tell Mom what happened at the bar last night?",Ted
Oh?,Ted
"Serious talk? Mom, what...? He was kissing another woman. Don't you care?",Ted
Mrs. Mosby?,Robin
What do you mean you're divorced? Since when?,Ted
"So ten months ago, you just up and decided to get divorced without telling me?",Ted
How could you not tell me this?!,Ted
So last Christmas...?,Ted
I got you a tandem bike.,Ted
Who the hell is Frank?!,Ted
"Okay, my head's about to explode, and I don't want to get it all over everyone's waffles, so I am leaving. ",Ted
"You know, he mentioned he was divorced last night. I totally spaced on that. Ooh, no line at the omelet station.",Barney
Lily... I'm sorry that I said all those things.,Marshall
"Me, too.",Lily
I just find it really confusing to be around you right now.,Marshall
It's the same for me. I think we're probably both better off trying to keep some distance for a while.,Lily
"Yeah, I think you're right. Are you wearing a push-up bra?",Marshall
Did you Mystic Tan your calves?,Lily
I withdraw the question.,Marshall
Thank you.,Ted
"No, this is ridiculous! We have to start talking about stuff, and not just baseball.",Ted
"Against the Red Sox? Boy, that's a big win. No. No. No. We're not gonna blow past this. I mean, I don't even know who you people. I don't even know how you met.",Ted
No.,Ted
"That's it? That's what passes for communication in our family? Man, when I have kids, and I tell them how I met their mother, I'm gonna tell them everything, the whole damn story.",Ted
"I just, I don't... I don't understand. You seemed so happy. When I was growing up, you seemed so... What happened?",Ted
So? Robin and I are like that. That doesn't mean anything.,Ted
Robin and I have different views on families. We're not about to break up because of it.,Ted
Wow.,Robin
I know.,Ted
They love me!,Robin
"Good. Good, I think it'll be really good for the family. By the way, how's Grandma? She hasn't returned my last couple calls.",Ted
No. No.,Ted
"Well, we just had our first fight.",Ted
We had our first fight.,Robin
"Oh, no, what'd you fight about? ",Barney
"A few months ago, my architecture firm was approached to design this new building...",Ted
It's this big skyscraper in Spokane. It'd be a huge project for his firm.,Robin
"And if we don't get it, we could go under.",Ted
"So anyway, the head architect unveils his new design to the whole company.",Robin
Yes.,Ted
"Well, all skyscrapers kind of look like a...",Marshall
"Marshall, it's a 78-story pink marble tower with a rounded top and two spherical entryways at the front.",Ted
"Wow, so it's the whole package.",Marshall
"Yeah, you did.",Barney
Had to.,Marshall
"Oh, dude, if they're selling condos, you got to get me in. And don't give me the shaft.",Barney
"Yeah, you did.",Marshall
Had to.,Barney
"It's a travesty. It's gonna define the skyline of the city. If it was me, I could've designed something amazing. Instead, I'm spending 12 hours a day designing the cornices.",Ted
"Yeah, you did.",Marshall
That wasn't one.,Ted
"So you and Ted had your first fight. It obviously ended well. I mean, you're here with me.",Lily
"Actually, it didn't end at all. I started getting bummed out, so I came here. It's what I do. When my grandma died, I got a perm.",Robin
"Ooh, two tragedies in one day.",Lily
"The thing is, Ted has been literally complaining about work nonstop for weeks. So, when I came over today, I was kind of done.",Robin
Hey.,Ted
Hey.,Robin
How was your day?,Ted
Good.,Robin
"Wow, you're a great interviewer. Aren't you gonna ask how my day was?",Ted
"No, I know how it was. It was awful. Ooh, you want to rent a movie tonight?",Robin
"You know, um... I listen to your work stories all the time.",Ted
"Yeah, but... and I don't want to be rude here, but my work stories are interesting. I'm a television news reporter.",Robin
Robin!,Lily
What? I knew exactly what he was going to say. I was just helping him get there faster.,Robin
You should work at a su1c1de hotline.,Lily
And then it got ugly.,Robin
"What I don't do is tell you the same story over and over again. I mean, you wouldn't watch the same movie over and over again, would you? Maybe a great movie like ",Robin
So that's your go-to bad movie? The number one example on the tip of your tongue of a bad movie is ,Ted
It's about ghost baseball players. I think it's stupid.,Robin
"So, now he's all mad at me about the stupid movie.",Robin
"Robin, he's upset because you wouldn't listen to him, not because you didn't like some movie.",Lily
How do you not like Field of Dreams?!,Ted
"Listening is the foundation of a relationship. And if he's really droning on, you can always practice saying the alphabet backwards. You know, in case you get pulled over for a DUI.",Lily
I guess I don't know how to do that.,Robin
"Yeah, it's really hard, even when you're sober. That's what I tried to explain to the cop.",Lily
"No, I mean, I guess I don't know how to do this girlfriend thing. I've never been in a relationship this serious before. I should probably go tell him I'm sorry, shouldn't I? You're trying to do it right now, aren't you?",Robin
What the hell comes before Q?,Lily
"Then at the end of the movie when he has a catch with his dad, like... Like he never did when he was young enough for it to matter.",Ted
"You know what, dude? Forget about Robin, okay? You're hanging with us tonight. I've got an awome party lined up.",Marshall
"Oh, God! This gonna be another one of your weird all-guy parties?",Barney
"That was a poker game. What is wrong with you? No, it's the first law school party of the year and it's gonna be awesome. I haven't seen this guys since, like, last year before Lily and I broke up. So I'm gonna have to break the news to everybody. It's really gonna bum them out. This party's gonna suck.",Marshall
"Well, love to join you at that one. But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.",Barney
"I wish I could join you guys, but I got to get back to my apparently boring job.",Ted
Your job's not boring.,Marshall
Robin thinks so.,Ted
"Dude, lots of chicks think architects are hot. Think about it, you create something out of nothing. You're like God. There's nobody hotter than God.",Barney
I love it when you quote Scripture.,Ted
"I'm telling you, you should use the architect angle with the ladies.",Barney
"Okay, first of all, I have a girlfriend. Second, the architect angle doesn't even work on her. And, third, I can't imagine that working on anyone ever.",Ted
That's 'cause you're always like... ,Barney
"Wait up, I'll leave with you guys. Ted Mosby, architect. Trust me.",Barney
"Hey, just out of curiosity. If a guy told you he was an architect, what would you think of that?",Ted
Are you kidding? Architects are hot. How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?,Girl
Solid point. She did have hair of gold.,Ted
"Yes, she did.",Girl
Mm-hmm.,Ted
"Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?",Robin
"No. Hey, Lily. You still single?",Carl
Yes.,Lily
You know... I've poured a lot of free drinks for you over the years. A lot.,Carl
"Carl, do you really want to be with a woman who would trade sex for beer?",Lily
Only if you're into it. It's on me.,Carl
Thanks.,Lily
I wonder where Ted went.,Robin
"Actually, yeah. Oh, he is such a cool guy. He was here earlier.",Robin
"Well, you know, soul of an artist, hands of a master craftsman. It was inevitable, I guess.",Ted
"Well, I could try, but you might end up looking like a midcentury tri-level. Hey, if you want, my friend Marshall invited me to this party we could all go to. Marshall's great. He's just a lawyer, but somebody has to push the paper around for us creative types. Am I right?",Ted
Yeah.,Girls
"He asked her to a party. Oh, my God, are you okay?",Lily
"Okay? It's awesome. It's a win-win. Ted got to vent and I don't have to hear it. Maybe after he's done with the talkie-talk, he'll come over and I'll get the fun part.",Robin
"What is wrong with you? God, I feel like I'm teaching love as a second language here. Okay, you know how when he tells you boring work stories you're supposed to listen? Well, when he picks up some random girl at a bar, you're supposed to freak out.",Lily
"I'm not freaking out because in my mind, she's fat.",Robin
She's a kickboxing instructor. Her ass looks better than my face.,Girl
"All right, we'll swing by the party.",Robin
"Damn, these are some drunk almost-lawyers.",Robin
"Okay, where are the guys and the hooker?",Lily
"Hey, drunk legal dude, um... Have you seen Marshall Ericksen? He was with a guy named Ted.",Robin
"Awards are nice, they look good on my shelf. But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.",Ted
Wow. I would love to watch the sun rise with you.,Girl
I know you would. It's the job.,Ted
"I didn't want to ruin the party for everybody this early, but, uh... everyone take a seat. Um... Lily actually called off the wedding this summer to go to San Francisco. So... We're broken up.",Marshall
"Yeah, that's not really the part I was worried about, guys.",Marshall
"Guys, can we cease and desist with the lawyer speak for a minute? Love died. The love that made you all believe in love, that's dead now.",Marshall
"Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?",Marshall
On the grounds of... shut up.,Kara
See? Marshall's still hung up on our breakup. Why? Because I listened to him. It was a strong and nurturing relationship that I threw away like old gum.,Lily
"Not that I'm worried or anything, but, um, back to the sun rising over Ted and, uh... Oh, what tasteful way did you describe her?",Robin
"Yes, that's the young lady.",Robin
"So, I know the bouncer at this techno club, Posers. Do you feel like dancing?",Girl
"Yeah, okay. There is no way Ted went dancing. Ted hates clubs.",Robin
"Hell, yeah. I love clubs. I mean, I was going to design a cathedral tonight, kind of take a whack at the whole relationship between God and man conundrum. But sure, let's go dancing.",Ted
Yay!,Girl
"Wait, let me just check with my friend.",Ted
Okay.,Girl
"Hey, Marshall. You up for some super loud, repetitive music that hasn't changed since the mid-90s?",Ted
Um... only always.,Marshall
Let's go.,Ted
"Dancing? He went dancing with this girl? Okay, maybe this is a little bad. Dancing is bad. Dancing leads to sex.",Robin
Did you grow up in that Footloose town?,Lily
"I'm calling him. I'm telling him that I was wrong and I'm sorry, and I totally want to listen to his stupid stories.",Robin
"Yeah, think of another way to phrase that and you'll be fine.",Lily
He's not answering. Calling Marshall.,Robin
Hello.,Marshall
"Marshall, hi, it's Robin. Can I talk to Ted?",Robin
"Oh, Robin, hi. Um, no, Ted's not here tonight. He's, uh... he's working.",Marshall
"Uh, okay. Bye. ",Robin
"Excuse me. I'm looking for a couple guys who came in here earlier. One's about six-four, 210, sandy brown hair. And the other's a cheating bastard.",Robin
You're going to need to refresh my memory.,Bouncer
"Okay, fella. Baby knows how this game's played. How's a $20 help your memory?",Lily
"Thanks, but seriously, it was crazy tonight. You really do need to refresh my memory.",Bouncer
Then can I have the...? That's cool. You keep that.,Lily
So these guys... One of them's an architect.,Robin
"Ted Mosby, the architect?",Bouncer
That's the one.,Robin
"Oh, yeah, he was here.",Bouncer
"And then I was all, No, Frank Gehry, you're on your own this time. And that, my dear, was the end of that hack's career.",Ted
I live across the street.,Girl
That is one hell of a non sequitur.,Ted
You want to come over?,Girl
"Well, I don't know. But I suppose I should at least give you a ride home. Hop on. ",Ted
Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudit√©s.,Bouncer
Nice. Giddy up!,Girl
"Dude, dude, what are you doing?",Marshall
Galloping.,Ted
"You proved it, all right? The whole Ted Mosby, architect things works.",Marshall
Architects rule! Whoo-hee!,Girl
"Aren't you a little worried that a certain somebody might find out that you're doing this? This isn't you, Ted.",Marshall
It is tonight. Whoo!,Ted
You know this girl. Where does she live?,Robin
I'm not telling you that for less than 20 bucks.,Bouncer
"Well, I'm out of money.",Lily
"I'm cashed, too.",Robin
I'll take your purse.,Bouncer
My purse?,Robin
"Yeah, my girl likes clutches.",Bouncer
"Okay, fine.",Robin
You should tell her that looks really good with a chocolate boot.,Lily
Bitch is lucky I brought my small purse. No room for my g*n. Here. Now where does the rodeo slut live?,Robin
"The building with the green light, apartment 3-C.",Bouncer
"Oh, my God, Robin, are you going to kick this girl's ass?",Lily
Yeah... And steal her purse.,Robin
"I can't believe he's cheating on me. You know how many times I could have cheated? Six... no seven. And you know two of them, and they would surprise you.",Robin
"3-C, let's do this. You ready?",Lily
Should I just kick the door in?,Robin
"Those are really nice heels and you already lost the purse. Let's see if it's unlocked. It's unlocked. Okay, get in there and kick some spankable ass. Robin?",Lily
I'm the problem.,Robin
What?,Lily
You were right. I don't know how to be a girlfriend. I took the nicest guy in the world and I made him a cheater.,Robin
"Well, don't stand out here and b*at yourself up. Get in there and b*at Ted up. I'll handle the slutty kickboxer. Actually, I'll take Ted.",Lily
Let's do this.,Robin
Bring it. ,Lily
What do you think you're...? Barney?,Robin
"Okay, I'm totally lost here. Where's Ted?",Robin
Ted? He's at work.,Barney
How did you get here?,Robin
Awesome story. As per usual.,Barney
How do you think Mr. Brady scored a babe like Carol?,Girl
Solid point. And she did have hair of gold.,Ted
"Yes, she did.",Girl
"Yes, they did. And you're just in time. Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you in very good, if slightly sullied hands.",Ted
Don't go. We don't even know your name to look out for your buildings.,Girl
"Yeah, stay ",Barney
Excuse us for one second. ,Ted
"Yeah, you did.",Barney
"Yeah, had to. See ya. ",Ted
"Oh, well, that's too bad. I'm Anna, by the way.",Girl
Ted Mosby... Architect.,Barney
But none of that acclaim means anything compared to the joy of seeing the sun rise over your first building.,Barney
"Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up!",Anna
"Dude, dude, what are you doing?",Marshall
Galloping.,Barney
"All right, you proved it. The whole Ted Mosby, architect thing works.",Marshall
Architects rule! Whoo-hoo.,Anna
"Aren't you afraid a certain somebody might find out about this? I mean, this isn't you, Ted.",Marshall
It is tonight.,Barney
"And that led to a couple of hours that I cannot, as a gentleman, divulge to you. We did it right here, and here and here.",Barney
But why would you use Ted's name?,Robin
I've had some recent bad press on the World Wide Web. So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole using my real name thing.,Barney
"Oh, this is great. It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.",Lily
Everything isn't okay. Look at me. I'm acting crazy and jealous and paranoid.,Robin
This is how people act in relationships.,Lily
And that's why I avoid relationships.,Robin
"Well, guess what, I haven't been crazy or jealous or paranoid in months, and I really miss it.",Lily
"And thus ended this chapter of, Let's pour our hearts out in the bedroom of Barney's one-night stand. Come on, let's go before she gets out of the shower.",Barney
You're such a pig. You're not even going to say good-bye?,Robin
"I'll have you know I composed a lovely form letter for use in just such an occasion. Just fill out her name and then... Something with a A. A... A... I'll just put resident. Go, go, go, go.",Barney
Hey.,Robin
Hey. What are you doing here?,Ted
"I brought donuts. And I don't want to brag, but they're filled with jelly.",Robin
"Thanks. So, uh... how was your night?",Ted
It was... fine. Nothing exciting. How was yours?,Robin
You really want to hear about boring architect stuff?,Ted
"Yes, I do. I'm sorry about earlier. To tell you the truth, I never even saw all of ",Robin
What? The best part's the last 20 minutes.,Ted
"Well, maybe they should have moved that part up a little bit earlier, 'cause... You know what, um... What I'm trying to say is... I love being the person you bitch to. So how was your day, Mr. Architect?",Robin
"Oh, I like the way you say that. Hey, you want to see the building that will make every man in Spokane feel inadequate?",Ted
Obviously. Wow.,Robin
Yes.,Ted
"You know, you didn't mention all the foliage around the base. If you trim that back, the rest would look bigger.",Robin
"You don't have to tell me. And, um... just for fun, I've... I've sort of been working on my own idea of what I think the building should be. What do you think?",Ted
"Wow. Ted, this is amazing.",Robin
Thanks. It's not like it will ever come to anything.,Ted
"I don't know. It might come to something. You know, girls find architects very hot. ",Robin
"Okay, but I don't want you expecting 78 storeys or anything. ",Ted
Barney? Who the hell is Barney?,Anna
Aaaaaaah!,Barney
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!,Lily
Welcome to my new home.,Lily
"Oh, wow, Lily, this is... Oh, this is all of it.",Ted
"Yeah,I know it's small, but it's got character. Thank you. And I am learning Lithuanian from my neighbors. They're great. They're always out there in the hall, you know, cooking and gambling and giving each other haircuts. It's nice.",Lily
"Hey,is that a toilet in your kitchen?",Ted
Or a stove in your bathroom?,Robin
"Oh, that's not just a stove. That's a stovenkerator: a combination of a stove, oven and sink and refrigerator. Stovenkerator. Isn't that futuristic?",Lily
"God,I hope not. Hey, cool murphy bed.",Ted
"It's kind of a mess. I didn't make my bed this morning, so...",Lily
Oh! You know what? I bet sleeping at this angle is good for you. For some reason.,Robin
"Hold on, I got it.",Ted
"That was something, something, I am going to something you like a something donkey.",Lily
Uh. Other cultures!,Robin
"Hey, let's break out the fruit basket. Hey, who ate all the...? ",Lily
"Okay, we have to get Lily out of that apartment. Her roommate is a raccoon.",Ted
"I'd offer her my place, but I've got dogs and she's allergic.",Robin
Dogs? I live with her ex-boyfriend. I think she's a little more allergic to that.,Ted
"What about your place, Barney? I know it's shrouded in mystery, but it's gotta have a couch.",Robin
The fortress of barnitude? No way.,Barney
Come on. She's desperate.,Robin
"Hmm, normally a prerequisite for the women I bring home, but... pass.",Barney
Absolutely not.,Robin
No.,Ted
"Damn! I got these tickets like months ago for me and Lily and now I can't find anyone to go with me. This is what I miss about being in a couple. I always had someone to go to concerts with, or farmer's market, or brunch. God, I miss brunch!",Marshall
"Well, I guess you could - well, you could try going to brunch alone.",Ted
"Oh, you don't think I've tried?",Marshall
Table for one.,Marshall
"Um, no, just me.",Marshall
You're right. Who am I kidding?,Marshall
"Oh, the Popover Pantry! That place is great. Can we go get brunch tomorrow?",Robin
"Of course, sweetie.",Ted
Can I go with you guys?,Marshall
Really? For brunch?,Ted
"God, I hate being single!",Marshall
Ted gave me your spare key.,Lily
Spare key! Brilliant!,Ted
"I'm sorry,but you know I'd only come here if I had no other choice. But earlier today, I was getting ready to go to sleep and...",Lily
"That's terrible. Well, see ya.",Barney
"Wait, can I stay here maybe?",Lily
"I'd let you, but I don't have any room.",Barney
You live in a two-bedroom apartment. You have one room just for your suits.,Lily
"Hey I'm at a point in my life where my suits are my family. Look around you Lily. You are in the heart of bachelor country, and as a woman, you are an illegal immigrant here. Now,you can try to apply for a sex visa, but that only lasts 12 hours. 14 if you qualify for multiple entry.",Barney
"Ewww!...Is something some lame, judgmental chick would say, but I say give me multiple high fives.",Lily
"Wow, you really are desperate.",Barney
I really am.,Lily
"Oh okay, you can stay here for two days. But I only have one rule. You can't change anything.",Barney
Why would I change anything? This place is... Perfect. Except for the fact that you don't have a TV.,Lily
"See that wall? 300-inch flat-screen. They only sell them in Japan, but I know a guy. Had to ship it over in a tugboat like freakin' King Kong.",Barney
It hurts my eyes.,Lily
Yeah. That doesn't go away.,Barney
"Hey, where have you been?",Ted
The Alanis Morissette concert.,Marshall
By yourself?,Ted
"No,actually I went with a friend from law school.",Marshall
"Oh,really? Who's this friend?",Robin
Brad.,Marshall
"Bro, Alanis Morissette rocks!",Brad
Totally! I can't believe I almost didn't come tonight.,Marshall
Let me guess: you bought the tickets for you and Lily right before she dumped you.,Brad
"Yeah, how'd you know?",Marshall
I just got dumped myself.,Brad
"What? Kara broke up with you? I'm sorry,man. That sucks. Brad,do you like brunch?",Marshall
You invited him to brunch?,Ted
"Yeah, I invited him to brunch. Why? Is that weird?",Marshall
Yes. That's why I was all you invited him to brunch?,Ted
Why can't two guys who are friends go to brunch?,Marshall
Because brunch is kind of...,Ted
Girly.,Robin
Girly? Breakfast isn't girly. Lunch isn't girly. What makes brunch girly?,Marshall
"I don't know. There's nothing girly about a horse, nothing girly about a horn, but put them together and you get a unicorn.",Ted
"I don't care what either of you say, I am going to the Popover Pantry with Brad. We're here. We're hungry. Get used to it, brunch.",Marshall
"Uhm, smells delicious.",Barney
"Thank you. There was no food in the fridge, so I picked up... ",Lily
"Lily, what was the first rule again?",Barney
Don't change anything?,Lily
And what was the second rule?,Barney
There was no second rule.,Lily
Exactly! There was only one rule and you broke it.,Barney
I bought groceries. That counts as changing something?,Lily
"Lily, if I wanted a fridge full of groceries or fresh coffee in the morning, I'd be in a relationship. But I don't want to be in a relationship. That's why I make it crystal-clear to every girl that walks through that door that this is not a place to leave a toothbrush. This is not a place to leave a contact lens case. This is a place to leave. Come on, 'll give you a tour. Uh, no flash photography please. ",Barney
Marshall doesn't have p*rn.,Lily
"Aww, that's sweet. While guys like Ted and Marshall may hide their p*rn, I had mine professionally lit. Girls see this, they can't get out of here fast enough.",Barney
"And if that doesn't drive them away, there's always your life-sized storm-trooper.",Lily
"No,that's just awesome. So you see, whenever a girl wakes up here, I never have to tell her to go build her nest somewhere else. My apartment does it for me.",Barney
"God, I love brunch.",Marshall
"Oh, damn... The zucchini bread is ",Brad
"This isn't weird, right?",Marshall
"I sort of thought it might be, but it totally isn't. Oh and btw, you totally did not oversell the eggs benny.",Brad
Right? Right?,Marshall
"I mean, why can't two single bros go out and rock brunch Sunday morning-style?",Brad
"Exactly. Thank you, that's exactly what I've been saying.",Marshall
This must be destiny.,Brad
What are you talking about?,Marshall
I have two tickets for ,Brad
Yeah!,Marshall
Hey. Did the cold wake you?,Barney
"No,I've just been watching you sleep.",Girl
"Oh,did you try and take a shower? I'm sorry, I only have one clean towel.",Barney
I don't buy into the myth that we need to shower every day.,Girl
"Okay. I'd offer you some coffee, but I don't have any, so you're gonna have to...",Barney
"I'm boycotting coffee. You may as well drink the tears of a colombian peasant farmer. God, I love this place. Good thing I don't have a job because I could stay here all day.",Girl
"I think I left something on the bookshelf. Whoops. Oh, no, oh, look ",Barney
"Wow, you're open about your sexuality and that's one of the reasons I love you. Did I just say that? Oh well. Cat's out of the bag. I love you.",Girl
"Whoa, uh, okay. Beep beep. Backing up, um...",Barney
Oh my god! Are you married? Is this your wife?,Girl
What? No. Yes!,Barney
Yes?,Girl
Yes.,Barney
You son of a bitch! I can't believe I let you enter my sacred temple.,Girl
"Come on, baby. please, no. You don't understand. What have I done? This is the worst. How could you...? ",Barney
"Well, she'd have to with your spring-loaded toilet seat, wouldn't she?",Lily
She was freakishly immune to everything in my apartment... Except you. You're better than p*rn.,Barney
Thank you.,Lily
"How would you like to extend your stay here? All you'd have to do is pretend to be my wife, and scare off the occasional one-night stand. I know,I know. You've got your ethics. You've got your principles...",Barney
I'll do it.,Lily
Really?,Barney
"Barney,you've clearly got some serious mother issues that have left you the emotional equivalent of a scavenging sewer rat. But, in my other apartment, I would be living with an actual scavenging sewer rat, so you win.",Lily
I'll take it.,Barney
nan,Ted
nan,Marshall
"No, totally. It sounds like a really, really fun, exciting, third date.",Ted
"Ooh, third date. You know what that means.",Robin
"It is not a date,okay. It's just two bros taking in a Broadway show.",Marshall
You bros going to get dinner beforehand?,Ted
"We might grab a steak, yeah.",Marshall
Where at?,Ted
nan,Marshall
Sounds like Brad's got quite the night planned out. You better bring your A game. That means no granny panties.,Robin
"All right, you know what? You two are just threatened because I'm a single guy moving in on your couples' stuff. Well, guess what? It's my territory now. I'm peeing all over brunches, fancy dinners and musicals. That's right. Brad and I are taking back Broadway.",Marshall
What are you going to wear?,Ted
I was thinking like this collared shirt and these pin... ,Marshall
Can you pass the arts and leisure?  Can you pass the arts and leisure?,Barney
I just did.,Girl
"Lily, I can explain...",Barney
How could you? In our own home? ,Lily
I'm so sorry. I-i didn't know he had...,Girl
Just get out. This is what I get after I worked as a stripper for four years to put you through medical school? I got breast implants for you. I... ,Lily
Brava. That was incredible. And that slap was genius. You did not hold back.,Barney
"Yeah, that I just always wanted to do.",Lily
"Fair enough. I have to say, it's kind of nice having food around here for a change.",Barney
"You know... Oh nah, never mind.",Lily
What? You're my wife. You can tell me anything.,Barney
"Well,if you really wanted to sell this ruse, we should try to make this place a little more... You know, homey. Like... Like a woman would actually live here.",Lily
What did you have in mind?,Barney
"Hey,you're home. I didn't think we'd be seeing you until tomorrow morning.",Ted
"Ha,ha,ha,ha. It wasn't a date. Okay, it was a date and it got way weird.",Marshall
"Oh, you really don't have to do that.",Marshall
"No, I insist. You're my guest.",Brad
"Thanks, Brad.",Marshall
Bro. You got some chocolate on your chin. Still there. I'll get that bad boy. ,Brad
Woah!,Ted
"Well, it could have been worse. It could have fallen in your lap.",Robin
It gets worse.,Marshall
"No, I can do it, Brad. Okay,thank you.",Marshall
"So anyway,ah,it's this Saturday. Do you want to come?",Brad
You want me to go to a wedding with you?,Marshall
"Okay, that's not too bad. Two single guys on the prowl. It'll be like Wedding crashers.",Ted
Just keep Brad away from the bouquet.,Robin
It gets worse.,Marshall
It gets better.The foliage in Vermont this time of year is ridonc.,Brad
Vermont?,Marshall
"Yeah,the wedding's at this awesome B&amp;B. Kara and I used to go there. Anyway, there is one room left,and we got it. Walt Whitman Suite, bro.",Brad
"You said no, right?",Ted
Of course.,Marshall
I understand. It's cool. It's the first time I was going to see my college friends since Kara left me. I just... I just miss her so much. ,Brad
I'll go to Vermont with you.,Marshall
"That's great! You know, uh, they're registered at Pottery Barn. I figure we could go halfsies on a gravy boat.",Brad
I'm sorry. It's not funny anymore.,Ted
"Damn you,brunch! This guy's crazy, right?",Marshall
"Look,I don't think he's crazy. I just think he's suffering from a severe case of girlfriend withdrawal. And unfortunately, you're his nicotine patch.",Ted
And now you have to do what every dysfunctional couple has to do: Break up.,Robin
"You're right. You're right. I promised brad I would go to the wedding with him,and then that is it.",Marshall
Good man.,Ted
"Oh,I think we made the right decision going for the custom-made italian sheets.",Lily
"Hey, if my bed's going suit up, it's going to do it right. Want to give it a whirl?",Barney
"All right, I'm going to head out, hit the bars. What are you going to do tonight?",Barney
"Oh, I was just going to watch Letterman but, God this bed is so comfy. I wish you had a TV in here. ",Lily
Please. ,Barney
I thought you were going out.,Lily
Eh. After the monologue.,Barney
No. No... No. No! No! ,Marshall
Hold on. ,Ted
"Oh, hey...",Brad
"No, Brad, uh, I don't want to hear it. I do like you. And calla lilies are my favorite flower. I don't know how you knew that. I guess you just get me, but this is not cool, man. I can't believe that you would...",Marshall
"Hey,sweetie.",Girl
Hey. ,Brad
"Aww. Hey, Marshall.",Girl
"Hi, Kara. So you guys,are like back together now?",Marshall
"Yeah. Happened last night. Uh, I'm sorry, bro. I should have called you.",Brad
"Yeah, you should have.",Marshall
"Well, I didn't mean to hurt...",Brad
"Don't, Brad. Just don't. ",Marshall
"Oh, what was with him?",Kara
I don't know. I think he's in love with me.,Brad
Aaaaaah!,Barney
Aaaaaaaaaaah!,Lily
I can't believe we just... You and I... What have we done?,Barney
Nothing. Nothing happened. We... We just went to sleep.,Lily
Just went to sleep? I don't sleep in the same bed as a woman and not make a move. How could... You! You spooned me against my will.,Barney
"Hey,it takes two to cuddle.",Lily
"We... We redecorated my place. We stayed in on a friday night to watch Letterman, and then slept together and didn't have sex? Oh my God! We're in a relationship!",Barney
That's what you think a relationship is?,Lily
"You were supposed to be the vaccine, but you gave me the disease. You gotta go.",Barney
"Barney. I don't think you're mad at me. You're mad at yourself. You let down your guard, and let someone into your life, and... And it actually felt okay. And that terrifies you.",Lily
Uh-uh. You gotta go.,Barney
"Hey, you can't just kick me out! I put a lot of work into this place, and I've grown accustomed to a certain standard of living.",Lily
A certain standard of living? You didn't pay a single...,Barney
"Oh my God, it's Brad. Laugh like I said something really funny. ",Marshall
That was great.,Ted
Right? Right?,Marshall
"Hey, Marshall.",Brad
"Oh, hey, hey, how's it going?",Marshall
It's good. ,Brad
"Yeah, I know who you are.",Ted
"Well,I got to go. I got this thing.",Brad
"Yeah, me too, but more important.",Marshall
"So, I guess I'll see you around.",Brad
Sure. Sure. ,Marshall
Totally looks fat.,Ted
It's just that all I've ever done is teach kindergarten. I want to get out there and change the world. I want to find my passion.,Lily
I'm going to be a marine biologist... Slam poet... Beekeeper! Not a beekeeper.,Lily
What is she doing for money through all this?,Ted
"Oh, she's been waiting tables at Big Wave Luau.",Robin
"Wait, you mean that hawaiian place where they wear those embarrassing outfits?",Ted
No.,Robin
Here she comes. Here she comes.,Marshall
"Welcome to big Wave Luau. Can I tiki your drink order? Aw, crap.",Lily
I'm sorry.,Robin
"Oh, hi, Lily. We were just in the neighborhood, thought we'd get some lunch. We didn't even know you'd be here. ",Barney
What do you want?,Lily
I don't think that's how you're supposed to greet a customer at Big Wave Luau.,Ted
"Aloha, island visitors. The big wave brought you to our humble luau. For that, we thank you. Or in my native tongue, mahalo.",Lily
I didn't catch your name. Did you guys catch her name?,Barney
No.,Ted
"My name is Anuhea. It means cool and fragrant,much like any of our 12 specialty drinks.",Lily
"Robin, nothing to add?",Ted
No. Lily is my friend and I'm not going to make fun of her for trying to follow her dreams.,Robin
Thank you.,Lily
"Although, you might want to bring out the big hawaiian drum because I'm pretty sure today's my birthday.",Robin
I've never need the beer more than I do right now.,Marshall
"I thought you said your semester was gonna be a piece of cake. I remember because you were eating a piece of cake at the time and you said, dude, my semester is gonna be this.",Ted
"Yeah, well, it was supposed to be, but my professor's like the toughest grader I've ever seen. She had like a bad divorce this summer and now she's taking it out on us. To tell you the truth, I think she just needs to get laid.",Marshall
"Really? Laid, you say?",Barney
"You wouldn't be into her.She's, like, in her late 40s.",Marshall
She hot?,Barney
"Yeah, I guess she's kind of hot, yeah.",Marshall
And she's looking for some action. Sounds to me like she could be a cougar.,Barney
A what?,Robin
"A cougar. An older woman, usually in her 40s or 50s, single and on the prowl for a younger man.",Barney
What's a woman in her 60s or 70s? A turtle?,Ted
"Marshall, I've thought it over and I accept your challenge.",Barney
I didn't challenge you to have sex with...,Marshall
"Tomorrow, the cougar hunt begins.",Barney
Classic.,Marshall
"Ted, didn't you tell me they need a new assistant in your office?",Robin
Yeah. Somebody did just quit.,Ted
"So, where should we eat today? ",Ted
"Dude, that is cold-blooded.",Marshall
"It was an honest mistake. Look, when somebody opens up a container with an entire chicken in it, it's okay to assume they made lunch for everyone.",Ted
"Ted, that girl didn't quit. You destroyed her.",Robin
It was an whole chicken. And did I mention she had 12 sides?,Ted
"Oh, now you're gonna bash her figure. Real classy, Ted.",Barney
"So, Lily, what do you say? Do you want the job?",Ted
What would I be doing?,Lily
"Basically, you're sort of a general office assistant.",Ted
You'll sit there. My station is right over here. And things are a little bit crazy right now 'cause we're pitching a new building to a big client.,Ted
"Oh, right, is that the...?",Lily
Yeah. Here's the model.,Ted
You weren't kidding. It really does look like a giant penis.,Lily
"I know. For whatever reason, Mr. Druthers just doesn't see it.",Ted
How can he not see it? I mean there's the...,Lily
I know.,Ted
And the way it...,Lily
I know.,Ted
And the two little...,Lily
I know.,Ted
It is just...,Lily
"Lily, this is Mr. Druthers, the head architect on the project. Lily's going to be our new office assistant.",Ted
Nice to meet you.,Lily
"I, uh... I am an architect.",Ted
"Well, not unless he somehow passed all his licensing exams.",Ted
Absolutely.,Ted
Styrofoam trees.,Ted
Styrofoam trees.,Ted
Styrofoam trees!,Ted
"Man, that guy is a total, well... ",Lily
"Okay, wait, wait, wait. That's professor Lewis's office there.",Marshall
"Okay, let's take a look. Oh, yeah, it's a cougar all right. A prime specimen. See, you can identify a cougar by a few key characteristics. Start with the hair. The cougar keeps up with current hairstyles as a form of camouflage. The prey may not realize that he's engaged a cougar until he's already being dragged, helpless, back to her lair. Now, the blouse. The cougar displays maximum cleavage possible to captivate her prey. If you're watching them bounce, she's about to pounce. See the claws? Long and sharp, to ward off rival females... Or open alimony checks. Yeah, this one's a beaut. Okay, let the hunt begin.",Barney
"Wait, wait, wait.I'm not so sure I'm comfortable with you hunting my constitutional law professor.",Marshall
"Who do you rather have grading your papers: a savage, man-eating jungle cat, or a purring, satisfied kitty?",Barney
"Go, Barney. Go mount and stuff that cougar.",Marshall
Direct. I like that. The name's Barney. What I want... is you.,Barney
I can't believe how Mr. Druthers treats people. And that building? Talk about overcompensating.,Lily
"He's not usually this bad. It's just that the partners have made it very clear this project is make or break for us, so lately he's been a little testy. ",Ted
Did you show lily your design?,Robin
No.,Ted
What design?,Lily
It's nothing.,Ted
"It's fantastic. Just for fun, Ted's been working on his own design. And it doesn't look at all like male genitalia. At least, not healthy male genitalia.",Robin
"Ted, you should pitch your building to Druthers.",Lily
"Are you kidding? He's Hammond Druthers. He's a legend. I'm just part of his team. This building is huge for the firm, so it's really important we don't blow it. ",Ted
"Oh, my god. Incredible.",Barney
C minus? What are you talking about? I just pulled an all-nighter!,Barney
Mr. Druthers asked if you were making the trees or waiting for them to sprout on their own. Then he stared at me until I laughed.,Lily
"Okay, I'm done.",Ted
Great. I'll put the paints away. You just go show him.,Lily
Great. Thanks.,Ted
"Good one, sir. Anyway, here they are.",Ted
Too green?,Ted
I can't un-picture it.,Ted
What? What's gone?,Ted
"Well, it's got to be around here somewhere.",Ted
"Well, um, I better get back to these styrofoam trees.",Ted
"Inspiring as always, sir. Lily? Where's she put those paints? ",Ted
Hey.,Lily
"Hey. Um, Lily, question for you. Why did I find Mr. Druthers' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose in your desk drawer?",Ted
That's easy. I took it.,Lily
Why?,Ted
It's simple.,Lily
"Okay, I may have exaggerated that last one, but the point is, he was mean. And that's why I took away his ball.",Lily
What does his ball have to do with anything?,Ted
"Druthers has to be taught he can't behave like that. When I was teaching kindergarten,whenever a kid was mean, I would take away one of his toys. The kid would be upset at first,but then he'd learn to stop being mean.",Lily
"Hey, guys. What's going on?",Robin
Lily stole my boss' baseball signed three times by Pete Rose.,Ted
Why? Was he being mean?,Robin
You know about this?,Ted
Yeah. It's her own personal form of justice. Did you tell him about that time at the Gap?,Robin
"Oh, that was a good one. This sales guy was rude to Robin, so I took a pair of khakis.",Lily
I gave them to you for your birthday.,Robin
So I've been walking around in stolen khakis?,Ted
I prefer to call them justice khakis.,Lily
"That's not justice. It's shoplifting,and it's a crime.",Ted
So is being mean.,Lily
"Lily, your little system doesn't even make sense. In kindergarten, the kid knew why he was being punished. Druthers just thinks someone stole his ball.",Ted
"Well, that's why I left a note.",Lily
A note?,Ted
"Yeah. When he finds it, he'll understand why his ball was taken away, he'll stop being mean, and the office will be a nicer place to work. Maybe he'll even be open to hearing your ideas.",Lily
"Look, Lil, we're all tolerating this prolonged nervous breakdown you're clearly having, with the punk band and the beekeeping and the petty larceny, but this is my career you're messing with.",Ted
I'm not sure I like your tone. You know what? Now you just lost the ball.,Lily
"I'd ask you how last night went, but we had a pop quiz today. Nobody got higher than a c-minus.",Marshall
"I know, I know.",Barney
You claim to have so much sex. I only assumed you'd be good at it.,Marshall
"Look, I miscalculated. I thought she'd be old and fragile, like most cougars. But kitty's got claws. Don't worry though. Tonight, I'm seeing her again.",Barney
"Just let it go, man. You're making things worse.",Marshall
"I promise you, after tonight, that cougar will be my pet, and I its master.",Barney
I think I'm falling in love with you.,Barney
What? No.We had sex yesterday.,Barney
"When Druthers goes to get his bagel, I'll go in, grab the note, put the ball back. If something goes wrong, yell out, who wants espresso? So I'll know he's coming. Got it? Okay, now give me the ball.",Ted
No.,Lily
"What do you mean, no?",Ted
"I mean I stand by what I did, Ted.",Lily
"Come on, Lily. We're running out of time.",Ted
Who wants espresso?,Lily
Interesting.,Lily
"Wow. Looks like bye-bye, iPod.",Lily
Give him his ball back right now. People are going to get fired.,Ted
"No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted. I saw this in kindergarten all the time.",Lily
"This isn't kindergarten. Mr Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.",Ted
"All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.",Lily
No. You'll give it back or you're fired.,Ted
"I'm sorry, Ted. I just can't do that.",Lily
Then you're fired.,Ted
Fine. Here's the ball. At least you have one now.,Lily
"Dude, you're k*ll me. You didn't tame the cougar. You just made her angrier.",Marshall
Do you not see the powerbar in my hand? I'm fueling up.,Barney
So you're going back over there?,Marshall
"Oh, yeah. And tonight, just like John Mellencamp, I am going to get rid of the cougar once and for all. Get it? 'Cause that's what he did with his name.",Barney
I can't stop thinking about you. Please give me another chance.,Barney
"But you don't understand. See, I've been going easy on you, holding back, 'cause I was afraid you'd break a hip or something. But, this time, no mercy.I don't care how long it takes days, weeks, half a year.",Barney
"Mr. Druthers, thank you again for understanding about Lily.",Ted
Lily was mentally deranged.,Ted
Lily was mentally deranged!,Ted
The clients are here.,Man
That's a penis!,Client
We're not building a penis. You got any other ideas?,Client
"Well, hats off to your ladyfriends, but I'm not building it. We're done here.",Client
Wait! We have one more idea for you.,Ted
I have another design.,Ted
No.,Ted
To Ted! The youngest person to ever design a building over 70 stories... Probably!,Robin
Probably!,All
"Congrats, ted.",Lily
"Hey, thanks for telling me to stand up to Druthers and pitch my idea. Seriously, none of this would have happened if it weren't for you.",Ted
"Oh. You know what, Ted? That was very nice. You have earned these screws back. Don't sit in your desk chair until you've put them back in.",Lily
"Hey, I'm project manager now, so, if you want your old job back...",Ted
"No, thanks. I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.",Lily
"Casey, that's not how we treat people. You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.",Lily
"Barney! Oh, my god!",Robin
What happened?,Ted
"That's not true. It's just temporarily dislocated. Seriously, I'm fine.",Barney
"Professor Lewis, hi.",Marshall
"Yeah, she was.",Barney
"B-plus?! Marshall, after I've gone through my eight weeks of physical therapy, I am going to get you that A!",Barney
Let her go. She belongs out there in the wild. You should feel proud. You fought the cougar and lived.,Marshall
It was an amazing safari. I can't wait to show you guys the slides!,Barney
"So, I guess that decides it.",Ted
Yup.,Marshall
Hanging out at a coffee place is not nearly as much fun as hanging out at a bar.,Barney
"Man, what's that?",Ted
What?,Marshall
That cute coffee girl wrote a heart by your name. Somebody has a crush on you.,Ted
Somebody thinks you're me.,Barney
"Do you really think she likes me? I mean, I guess it's not that surprising. Every time I come in here, I totally crack her up.",Marshall
Wow. How did you fit a pumpkin in this little cup?,Marshall
I'll have a pumpkin latte.,Man
How do they even fit a pumpkin in those little cups? What? You got a shrink ray back there? Yeah.,Marshall
"Hey, remember that time I said that thing about how do they fit a pumpkin into that little cup?",Marshall
The first time.,Marshall
Right?,Marshall
"All right, there's only two reasons she'd laugh at that. One, it's the first joke she's ever heard, or two, she likes you. You should totally ask her out.",Ted
You think?,Marshall
"Yeah, that's why you're not back with Lily, right? So you can experience what it's like to be single.",Ted
"Well, what if the heart doesn't mean anything? What if she writes it on all the cups?",Marshall
"Mine says Ted, no heart.",Ted
"Mine says... Swarley. How'd they get Swarley from Barney? It's not even a name. Who would ever be called Swarley? Oh, please don't start calling me Swarley. This would never happen at a bar! ",Barney
Man! What's up with Swarley?,Ted
I know. You almost never see old Swarlz get that upset.,Marshall
"Hey, guess what? Oh, sorry.",Ted
It's only my mom. She's just rambling on like always. What happened?,Robin
Marshall asked out a girl.,Ted
"Wow.  Well, if anything, that's Dad's fault. That'll keep her going a while.",Robin
"Oh, of course, you know, he had a little help.",Ted
Swarley hooked him up?,Robin
"Oh, good. You got my text.",Ted
Yeah.,Robin
"Oh. No, it was me. I gave Marshall one of my secrets.",Ted
"So, what she say?",Ted
Nothing. I don't think she heard me. It's pretty busy up there.,Marshall
"What? You gave her the look right? Head down, eyes looking up, hands in pockets, shoulders up, head slightly tilted, conveying shy vulnerability.",Ted
"I think so. Look, can we just go?",Marshall
I didn't order that. Phone number.,Marshall
I love that look. I think I slept with you because of that look. And it's fake?,Robin
"Oh, and you biting your lower lip, shyly looking away and thrusting your chest out is natural?",Ted
"Yeah, I hear you.",Robin
"Hey, guys. Are you free tomorrow night? I was thinking of having a wine tasting slash help me catch the rat in my apartment party.",Lily
That's a great idea. You can put out cheese for both.,Ted
"I should invite Marshall, right? It'd be weird if I didn't.",Lily
"Yeah, I don't think he can go.",Ted
Really? Why not?,Lily
"Uh, okay, um... Lily, we have to tell you something. Marshall has a date.",Robin
Oh. Well... good for him.,Lily
Really? You're okay with it?,Ted
"Look, we've been broken up almost six months. I mean, I'm not thrilled about the idea, but he has every right to date someone else.",Lily
That's very mature.,Robin
Why are you holding the phone?,Lily
"Oh, sh**t.  That's hilarious, Mom. Didn't even notice.",Robin
"Hey, dude, by the way, I really like that suit. Tell me about the fabric. Is it foreign or something?",Ted
"Wow. It is foreign. I'm impressed, Ted. It's Moroccan, actually.",Barney
Whoa.,Ted
I got a call for Swarley. Is there a Swarley here?,Carl
"You weren't interested in my suit at all, were you?",Barney
Swarley!,Carl
Important call for Swarley!,Carl
Stop calling me that.,Barney
"Uh... Hey, I'd like you guys to officially meet Chloe.",Marshall
Hi.,Ted
Hi.,Barney
Hi. It's nice to meet you guys. I'll be right back.,Chloe
It's right back there. Right? Right? She's hot! And she likes me? She likes Italian food. I also like Italian food. She likes Billy Joel. I also like... music. And I think we're going to go out again.,Marshall
"Dude, you gotta ditch her.",Barney
Obviously.,Ted
Why?,Marshall
She's got the crazy eyes.,Barney
Dude. The eyes. They're crazy.,Ted
"What are you guys talking about, the crazy eyes?",Marshall
"It's a well-documented condition of the pupils, or pupi.",Barney
No. Just pupils.,Ted
It's an indicator of future mental instability.,Barney
She does not have the crazy eyes.,Marshall
You just can't see it because you're afflicted with haven't been laid in a while blindness.,Ted
"She was too far away in the coffee place, but when I saw her up close just now...",Barney
"Hey, I'd like you guys to officially meet Chloe.",Marshall
Hi.,Ted
Hi.,Barney
Hi.  It's nice to meet you guys.,Chloe
"Guys, I'm not going to stop dating Chloe just because you think she has the crazy eyes.",Marshall
"You can keep going out with her, but you're gonna regret it. One time, I met a girl at this very bar. I saw that she had the crazy eyes... But I ignored it. And then, sure enough.",Barney
"Barney, can I ask you a question?",Girl
Anything.,Barney
Would you like to have a threesome?,Girl
Of course.,Barney
"Great. It'll be you, me and Mr. Weasels.",Girl
"So, did you do it?",Ted
No. It ended up being just a twosome with the third one watching from a chair.,Barney
Which one were you?,Ted
I'd rather not say.,Barney
"Look, there was a time I didn't believe in the crazy eyes either, and then I met Jeanine. She had serious crazy eyes. I told myself I was just imagining it, but then...",Ted
"So, should we go get a drink?",Ted
As long as it's in your apartment. ,Jeanine
"Whoa, I'm sorry.",Driver
"You guys, Chloe is not  gonna do any of that stuff. She's a nice girl from Nebraska. She's not crazy. She's... she's awesome.",Marshall
"Marshall, it's Chloe.",Chloe
Are you the one who's called me like nine times?,Marshall
Yeah. Could you come get me?,Chloe
I'm in the middle of taking a test.,Marshall
Please. I'm so scared.,Chloe
"Well, what's going on?",Marshall
This weird midget guy started following me  and he was screaming at me and he had a limp and a big hump on his back and the police didn't believe me and I almost got trampled by a horse and... God I must sound totally crazy to you right now.,Chloe
No. Pfft. Not at all.,Marshall
"So, she's needy crazy. That's one of the worst kinds.",Ted
"I've had one of those. Makes up stories to get attention. Went out with her for three weeks, her dad died twice.",Barney
"Guys, she was really freaked out, okay? Maybe the story is true.",Marshall
What in the world would make you believe that's a true story?,Barney
She's really hot.,Marshall
They always are.,Barney
"You all done with that, Ted?",Wendy
Yeah.,Ted
Ned. I told you to call him Ned.,Barney
That's just sad.,Ted
"Sorry, Swarley.",Wendy
"So, do just you and Ted live here or does Swarley live here, too?",Chloe
Nah. Swarley has his own place.  What was that?,Marshall
"Oh, I, uh, dropped my keys.",Chloe
"So, here you go. Two pumpkin beers. I was joking. They're regular beers. What is that? This picture is broken.",Marshall
Oh. That's too bad. Is that Lily? Is that the girl you were going to marry?,Chloe
Yeah. Is that what that sound was? Did you just smash this?,Marshall
No. Why would I do that?,Chloe
Let me look into your eyes.,Marshall
Okay. I had a really nice time tonight.,Chloe
"Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.",Marshall
"I like your eyes a lot, too.",Chloe
Stooooop!,Lily
What's up Swarlz?,Robin
"No. Okay? No. No more. I will not let this become a thing. It's over. No more Swarley. No Swarlz. No more Swar-lay. No more Swar... wait for it... ley. No more Bob Swarley, man. No more. No! It's over. Do you understand?",Barney
Yes.,Robin
Yes.,Lily
Thank you. ,Barney
Nice.,Robin
Why didn't you call me?,Lily
Was I supposed to call you?,Robin
"Yes, about the whole Marshall-dating-another-girl thing.",Lily
You said you were fine with it.,Robin
"Yeah, in front of Ted, but then I sh*t you a look.",Lily
What look?,Robin
This.,Lily
That doesn't seem like a look.,Robin
"Yes it is. It means,  I'm upset call me later.",Lily
You should have pulled me aside and told me what the look meant.,Robin
"If I pulled you aside, I wouldn't need the look.",Lily
"Well, maybe if it was a more distinctive look...",Robin
"Okay, the look isn't important. What's important is that I can't stand the idea of Marshall dating another woman. I mean, what if he falls in love with her?",Lily
"Well, if it makes you feel any better, Ted says she has the crazy eyes.",Robin
What's that?,Lily
"Apparently, a thing women have that guys can see and it tells them that the girl's crazy.",Robin
"Oh, kind of like how you never want to date a guy with perfect fingernails?",Lily
Jerk nails. Exactly.,Robin
"Well, did Ted say whether she was good-looking? I mean, 'cause if I knew she was ugly, then maybe I wouldn't be so freaked out.",Lily
"Uh, he didn't say, but you can find out. I think her name is Chloe, she works at Cosa Coffee on 78th.",Robin
Phone call for Swarles Barkley?,Carl
"Is, um, Chloe here?",Lily
"Oh, thanks, Brian.",Lily
Your tag says Brian.,Lily
"Yeah, see you later, Brian.  There she is. She doesn't look that great. She's not fat, but that doesn't mean anything. I know tons of skinny, ugly women. That's right, snotty girl in my yoga class, I'm talking to you. Come on, Chloe, turn around. Here we go. Turn around, Chloe. Come on, show me that hideous face. Damn it! Ooh, I know, I'll get ahead of her, then I'll cut back so I...  Aah! Oh, my God, that hurts! Turn around! Come on! Just turn around! Okay, this is ridiculous.  Hey!  Turn around! What's the matter with you?  Hey, you! Turn around! Turn around, Chloe! ",Lily
She's hot? I'm so sorry.,Robin
"No, it's fine. It just makes things easier. Now that I know she's a threat, all I have to do is keep Marshall from ever seeing her again. Okay, I have two plans, you can help me choose. Plan A) remember that time Marshall and I had sex in the bathroom? Oops, I got knocked up.",Lily
Lily.,Robin
"Okay, plan B) is called Chloe's Accident.",Lily
Just stop.,Robin
What?,Lily
"Lily, you can't do any of those things. If you two are ever gonna get back together, you have to let him work out whatever this is.",Robin
I know. You're right.,Lily
"Now, come on, Ted asked us to be upstairs at 6:00. Some surprise for Barney.",Robin
Barney?,Lily
"Uh, Swarley.",Robin
"Hey, guys.",Ted
Hey. Where's Marshall?,Lily
"Oh, he's getting a haircut.",Ted
Oh. For his date. Good for him. Hope he has a good time tonight.,Lily
"Relax, you've got nothing to worry about. The girl's crazy.",Barney
Thanks!,Lily
"He'll just have wild monkey sex with her five times, max, and be done with her.",Barney
Thanks again.,Lily
What are you doing?,Barney
"I just wanted to listen to a little music, that's all.",Ted
"Ha-ha! Now I'm a woman. I love it! You know, I was thinking about this whole new name thing last night, and you know what I realized? I like it.",Barney
You like being called Swarley?,Robin
Are you kidding? I want you to call me that.,Barney
Do you really think this is gonna work?,Ted
"Do I think what's gonna work? I'm just saying, I love my new name, so please only call me that from now on.",Barney
Call you what?,Ted
"You know, that-that-that new name that you've been calling me.",Barney
Say it.,Ted
Why? You guys know what it is.,Barney
Say the name.,Ted
"No, I don't want to! I hate it! I hate it! It's not funny! It's never been funny! I've never done any... No! ",Barney
"Man, he is really gonna lose it when all the magazine subscriptions start coming in.",Ted
"I signed him up for People in Espanol, but I addressed it to Swarlos.",Robin
"Hey, where's the picture of Marshall and me at the pier? Didn't it used to be by that window?",Lily
"Oh, yeah, he, uh, he sort of took it down when you left. Put it behind some books, I think.",Ted
"Oh, well-well, maybe I should put it back up.",Lily
"Why, so Chloe'll see it and get scared off?",Ted
"No. So Marshall'll see it and feel guilty. Yeah, okay.",Lily
"...anymore. Pretty impressive, huh?",Chloe
"Wow, you really did memorize all the lyrics to We Didn't Start the Fire. Can I, uh, can I get you a drink?",Marshall
I'd love a beer.,Chloe
You got it.,Marshall
I had a really nice time tonight.,Chloe
"Yeah, me, too. Stop blinking.",Marshall
"I like your eyes a lot, too.",Chloe
Stooooop! Hi. I'm Lily.,Lily
"Lily... Lily, what the hell are you doing?",Marshall
"I don't know. I... I don't know... what I'm doing. Oh, pumpkin beer, that was a good one. I'm just... I'm gonna go. I... I'm so sorry. Enjoy the rest of your date.",Lily
She seems nice.,Chloe
"Lily, what the hell...",Marshall
"I'm sorry. I only snuck up there because... When I saw how cute she was yesterday, I freaked out.",Lily
"Lily, you saw her yesterday?",Marshall
"Yeah, I... kind of chased her down the street.",Lily
"Wait, so you were the hunchback with the limp?",Marshall
"Yeah. And she didn't break the picture, I did.",Lily
"So Chloe's not crazy, she's... just a nice, normal girl.",Marshall
"Yeah, she is. And you deserve a nice, normal girl. So, why don't you just go back up there and finish your date.",Lily
"Yeah. Okay. Wait, if you were the hunchback, then why did she think you were a guy?",Marshall
I-I might have used a voice that sounded like this.,Lily
Why?,Marshall
"Because I didn't want her to know it was me, which I now realize doesn't make sense, because she hadn't even met me.",Lily
You're crazy. You have... crazier eyes than anybody that I have ever met.,Marshall
Shouldn't you be going back up...,Lily
"I mean, you're out of your mind. You're... just absolutely insane.",Marshall
Shouldn't you be going back upstairs?,Lily
I've missed you so much. ,Marshall
"Okay, I ran it by the group, and we decided we're gonna give you a choice. We will agree to stop calling you Swarley, but instead, we'll call you Jennifer. Well?",Ted
"I'm thinking. How about this? On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, you...",Barney
"Oh, my God.",Robin
"Hey, Chloe, I... guess I forgot I left you up here.",Marshall
"I was gonna leave, but I can't find my keys.",Chloe
They're right there on the coffee table.,Marshall
"Silly me. I must have looked everywhere else. Well... I'm just gonna go. Oh, I don't think we've met. I'm Chloe.",Chloe
Robin.,Robin
"It's nice to meet you, Roland. I'll see you guys later.",Chloe
"Roland? Your name's Roland. That's funny, right? Rock and Roland. Warsaw is the capital of what? Roland. You're Monica Roland-ski. Hey, yeah, that's just how I Roland.",Barney
"Nice try, Swarley.",Ted
Damn it.,Barney
Swarley!,Everybody
"Oh, my God. These pancakes are delicious!",Lily
"Yes! Thank you. Uhm, I learned how to cook while you were gone this summer.",Marshall
Oh. Do you want to cook dinner tonight?,Lily
"Yeah, sure. How about pancakes?",Marshall
"You may not have much range, but at least I'm marrying a guy who knows how to make pancakes.",Lily
"Oh, uhm...",Marshall
"I mean, uhm... Well, I... I realize that we haven't really discussed whether us getting back together means us getting married, but... I still wanna. Do you still wanna?",Lily
Really?,Marshall
"Of course, I love you.",Lily
"No, I mean, that's how you're gonna do it? Do you still wanna? That's like the lamest proposal ever. When I did it, I got down on my knees... I don't know, I'm just saying.",Marshall
"No, no, no, no, no, no.",Marshall
What?!,Lily
"You can't lead with that. You got to... build up to that. You got to have, like, a little speech.",Marshall
Do you remember your proposal to me? ,Lily
I had a speech prepared.,Marshall
What do you want to hear?,Lily
"I don't know. I mean, you could tell me, like, about how good-looking and funny and smart I am and I've been working out lately. It might be nice for you to mention something about that.",Marshall
Marshall... You are good-looking...,Lily
Thank you.,Marshall
Funny...,Lily
"Oh, thanks.",Marshall
Smart...,Lily
And a few tears wouldn't hurt.,Marshall
"Okay, would you freakin' marry me already?",Lily
"I'll marry you. Of course. But, uhm, until you see a ring on this finger, don't expect me to put out.",Marshall
"Yeah, right. ",Lily
I'll give you this. That was a very creative use of syrup.,Marshall
"I can't even look Mrs. Butterworth in the eye. Oh, my God. We're getting married!",Lily
"I know, I know.",Marshall
"Man, I made a big mess by canceling this wedding, didn't I?",Lily
"It's okay, baby. You're not just realizing that now, are you?",Marshall
"God, the idea of standing up there in front of all those people who hate my guts... Just makes me want to run off to Atlantic City and get married today.",Lily
Yeah...,Marshall
Coming up at 11:00: Are there piranhas in the East River? What you don't know... could eat you.,Robin
Robin! Stop the news!,Marshall
What the hell?,Woman
It's okay. They're my friends.,Robin
We're going to Atlantic City to elope. You got to come with us.,Lily
"Oh, my God, that is so fantastic! I don't know if I can just leave work.",Robin
"It's okay, Mike can read the news tonight.  Hey, Mike... You can read, right?",Woman
"Yeah, I'm the best at reading.",Mike
Let's go to Atlantic City!,Robin
Yeah!,All
"You guys are eloping! Oh, that's fantastic. Wait, is this because there's a time crunch Uncle Ted should know about?",Ted
I hope not because I plan on getting hammered.,Lily
"Guys, this sounds like so much fun, but I can't really take off work. I'm kind of important around here, you know? I'm the project manager.",Ted
"Ted, for the rest of our lives, we are going to be telling the amazing story of how we went to Atlantic City and got married. Don't you want to be in that story?",Lily
Of course I do. Let's go to Atlantic City!,Ted
Yeah!,Marshall
"Oh, but when we tell the story, can you leave out the part where I hesitate?",Ted
You got it.,Marshall
"Hey, guys.",Barney
Wow. A pedicure.,Ted
"Uh, if there were any shame in a dude getting a pedicure I don't think there would have been a feature about it in Details magazine.",Barney
We're going to Atlantic City to elope right now!,Lily
"Oh, congratulations, Lily. Marshall, you're getting married? What the hell?",Barney
So are you in or not?,Marshall
"Hell, yeah, I'm in! Just... I'm almost done.",Barney
"No, we got to get going to the...",Marshall
"Well, actually, I mean... It is my wedding day, and since we're here...",Lily
Wow. Look at this place. I guess I'll have my pick of something old.,Lily
And something blue. Somebody should really check on this lady.,Marshall
"Ah, A.C., always in decline, never hitting bottom. It's good to be back, old friend.",Barney
You been here before?,Ted
"Oh, uh, once or twice.",Barney
"Ah, good to see you, too. Three times, maybe.",Barney
The wedding chapel... This is it. Are you ready to do this?,Lily
I'm ready. Let's get married.,Marshall
"Oh, crap. I don't have a veil. I'm a bride, I can't get married without a veil. And a bouquet. I need a veil and a bouquet. Oh, my God, we're getting married.",Lily
"Don't worry. Relax. We'll get you a veil, honey.",Robin
"Oh, Robin, that's a really cute outfit.",Lily
"Oh, really? Thanks.",Robin
"Yeah, it has to go. I'm the bride, you can't look better than me.",Lily
Done. ,Robin
I'm going to get the bouquet. You guys get the veil. We'll meet in the chapel in 20 minutes. Ready? Break. ,Lily
You guys want to go gamble?,Ted
"No, we got to go get the veil.",Marshall
"Or we looked everywhere, and we couldn't find one.",Ted
"Yeah, okay.",Marshall
"No, you guys go ahead. I'm going to find the veil. ",Barney
"So this is it, right? The last 20 minutes of your single life. I'm proud of you, buddy.",Ted
Thanks.,Marshall
How are you feeling?,Ted
"Great, a little nervous.",Marshall
Yeah? Craps?,Ted
Not that nervous.,Marshall
"No, I mean do you want to play craps.",Ted
"Oh, yeah, definitely.",Marshall
"Okay, I got the veil. She wasn't ready to be married. All right, let's talk bachelor party. Are we thinking full-on strip club, or should we rent a room and have a private toy show?",Barney
What did you just say?,Ted
"Barney, no.",Marshall
"Marshall, I'm your best man.",Barney
You're not my best man.,Marshall
Right here.,Ted
"And as your best man, I have to throw you a bachelor party. That's part of being a best friend.",Barney
You're not my best friend.,Marshall
Right here.,Ted
"Barney, I don't have any time for a bachelor party. I've got, like, 18 minutes.",Marshall
18 minutes...,Ted
"Oh, good. Did you get the veil?",Lily
Of course.,Barney
And it took us exactly 18 minutes. We went to a strip club.,Marshall
Dude!,Ted
Unbelievable!,Barney
We weren't there for very long. It's not like I had time to have a lap dance or anything. I got a lap dance.,Marshall
Your last lap dance ever.,Lily
Right. What?,Marshall
"Oh, God, the things people waste money on in Atlantic City.",Ted
Does it smell like strippers in here?,Robin
"That's weird, right? Marshall and Lily are getting married!",Ted
"Hell, yeah, look at this. ",Lily
"Oh, baby, this is it. Let's do this thing.",Marshall
Hi. We're here to get married.,Lily
Congratulations. We offer a variety of packages to give you the special day you've always dreamed about.,Woman
We don't want any of that. Just your basic quickie wedding will be fine.,Marshall
"Yeah. You know this isn't Vegas, right?",Woman
"Well, sure. In Vegas, the casinos pump in oxygen. Here, it looks like everyone brought their own.",Robin
It also takes three days to get a marriage license in New Jersey. The earliest I could book you for is Monday.,Woman
"No, no, no, it has to be today. That's the whole point.",Lily
"Look, I don't know what to say, but if you guys don't want to book a wedding for Monday or play a round of keno, I can't help you. Thirty-five.",Woman
"Wait, I don't understand, people get married in Atlantic City all the time.",Ted
"Yes, they do, but they don't elope. They choose Atlantic City for its white sand beaches, world-class amenities, and exotic Riviera feel.",Woman
Have you been outside?,Lily
There is half an orca whale rotting not 20 feet from the cabana.,Ted
"You guys, take it easy, guys. Are you sure about this?",Marshall
"About the marriage laws of the state where I work in a wedding chapel? Yeah, I'm pretty sure.",Woman
Bright side: the bachelor party continues!,Barney
Yes! Continues? You mean start. He means start. We went to a strip club.,Ted
Twenty-seven.,Woman
Is there any way that we could get a license today?,Lily
"You could go to the courthouse. In some extreme circumstances, the waiting period can be waived, but you have to have a good reason.",Woman
"Well, we're in love.",Lily
What better reason could there be?,Marshall
"The last one I heard was, I'm going to Iraq tomorrow to defend my country, but, you know, give yours a whirl.",Woman
"God, this is taking forever.",Marshall
"I know. I am so proud of these two. After all they've been through. In fact, that crazy road has led them all the way here to Atlantic City...",Ted
"Ted, up here.",Robin
Uhm?,Ted
You were just staring at my shirt boobs.,Robin
"No! I wasn't. I was checking out the hot body underneath the shirt. Okay, look, maybe I was looking at your shirt, but it's a, it's a funny, funny shirt.",Ted
Hi.,Barney
See you.,Barney
What the hell was that?,Ted
A... Chinese guy?,Barney
"Hi. Hello. Uh, we need a marriage license, but we need to skip the waiting period because... We're in love.",Marshall
"Oh, really?!",Lily
"Oh. Well, so can we see a judge?",Lily
Really?!,Lily
Why are you doing this to us?!,Marshall
Really?!,Robin
You know what? We get it.,Marshall
"Okay, this is a good plan B. Judges are people. People go to the bathroom. A judge is bound to come by eventually, and we'll get married. I'm sure we won't be waiting long.",Lily
"Geez, you go to a vending machine for 30 seconds.",Marshall
Vultures.,Barney
What? Here?,Robin
Yeah. Got a little time to k*ll.,Ted
"Oh, my God, it's the T-shirt, isn't it?",Robin
No. A little.,Ted
Something is seriously wrong with you.,Robin
"So what, is that a no?",Ted
"All right, let's do it.",Robin
"All right. Um, also...?",Ted
"Yes, I'll leave it on.",Robin
Sweet.,Ted
"Look, I know this is turning into a bit of a disaster, but believe me, it's better than the alternative.",Lily
"You throwing a big, free party with lots of booze and food and all your single, desperate girlfriends from college? Yeah, glad we dodged that b*llet.",Barney
"Judge! Judge, come on. Come on, come on, come on!",Lily
Turn it off.,Judge
Okay. May we please get married today?,Lily
"Now, normally I would say no to a request like that, but you two impress me. Just the fact that you've been together for ten years, standing by each other's side through thick and thin, never wavering. What was that?",Judge
What was what?,Lily
That little look. What was that?,Judge
A look of love.,Marshall
"You two have stood together through thick and thin, right?",Judge
"You know, what's thick? what's thin?",Marshall
"Yeah, I mean, all... yeah.",Lily
I have.,Marshall
"All right, what was that look? What's going on?",Judge
They broke up over the summer. Lily totally ran off to San Francisco and these two just had sex in the closet. What? We're under oath.,Barney
"No, we're not.",Ted
"Yeah, we are. He's a judge.",Barney
Wh-- Did we take an oath? Do you even know what an oath is?,Ted
"Uh, yeah. Courthouse. Oath. We're under it.",Barney
Guys. It's looking like this isn't gonna happen.,Marshall
"No, Marshall, we are gonna get married today.",Lily
"Baby, anyplace we go, we're gonna need a marriage license.",Marshall
Except international waters. So let's find a ship captain. A ship captain can marry us. There's boats all over this place.,Lily
"Oh, is that what those wooden things are floating between the garbage?",Ted
This is a great idea. This is gonna work. Let's go.  Excuse me. Are you a ship captain?,Lily
This is my machine.,Woman
I should go talk to her.,Marshall
"No, let me.",Robin
Blackjack?,Ted
Yeah.,Marshall
"Well, I found a guy who said he'd be willing to put his boat in my slip, so we're getting closer.",Lily
"Okay, Lil, why is it so important to do this today?",Robin
"Because... If we don't do it today, I just know we're gonna wind up having a huge wedding with a huge crowd full of huge Midwestern people looking all disapproving and judging me while sipping little cups of mayonnaise and cracking runaway bride jokes all night long.",Lily
Nobody's gonna do that.,Robin
"No, they're not because I'm not gonna give them the chance. I'm gonna find a ship captain and we're gonna be married tonight.",Lily
"Sweetie, this is crazy. You're never gonna find a ship capt...",Robin
"Hey, Lily. Found a ship captain.",Marshall
What?,Lily
Yeah. First guy we talked to. Ship captain. How great is that?,Ted
"See? See, this is destiny. So, captain, can you take us out to international waters and marry us?",Lily
"I sure can. If there's two things I love, it's bringing people together in marriage and making $5,000.",Captain
What?,Marshall
"Deal. $5,000, okay, we can do that. Come on, everybody. Fork over your cash. Don't think. Just do it.",Lily
I can get us that money.,Barney
How?,Ted
Have you noticed that all day today Chinese guys have been coming up and saying hi to me?,Barney
Yes. Have you noticed I haven't asked about it because I'm too scared of the answer?,Ted
"Well, those are my old gambling buddies. Truth is... I used to come here all the time. Play an old Chinese game called Shing Hasabu Shing. Had a small gambling problem. Actually, it wasn't so small. I kind of lost my entire life's savings. But tonight, I don't know, I'm feeling hot. I think I can win us that money.",Barney
"No, we're not letting you gamble all our money away.",Robin
"Uh, it's not gambling if you absolutely know you're going to win. I'll get us that money. I swear it, nay... I oath it.",Barney
Do you understand what's happening?,Lily
Not a clue.,Ted
Do you think he's winning?,Robin
I don't even know if he's playing.,Ted
"Wait, I get it. I understand this game.",Marshall
"No, you don't.",Ted
"I totally understand the game, Theodore. Barney, split your tiles. You can triple your money if you find the jellybean.",Marshall
"Marshall, please. Don't you think I know what I'm... My God, you're right.",Barney
Wow. It's beautiful.,Lily
"Thanks, Barney.",Marshall
"Did you guys see me? I was on fire tonight. Man, I can't wait to get back to the shore. God, I love gambling!",Barney
"When we get home, we're gonna go to a little meeting. Okay?",Ted
Why can't I do it just a little?,Barney
Okay. Let's get this started.,Lily
"Okay, uh... You guys want the serious one or the funny one?",Captain
"You sure? I got a lot of great nautical jokes in there. Like how you two float each other's boat, stuff like that.",Captain
"Yeah, serious is probably good.",Marshall
"We stand witness today to celebrate the union of Lily and Marshall. Today, you two will become one, sharing your lives, the happiness, the sadness, the frustrations and the joy...",Captain
This is pretty cool. I can't believe you never want to get married.,Ted
I never said never.,Robin
"...to declare your love and devotion to each other in front of friends and family, all the people who matter most to you. What was that?",Captain
What was what?,Marshall
That little look. You two just shared a look.,Captain
We don't want to do this.,Lily
We don't.,Marshall
Are you kidding me? You guys are calling off another wedding?,Ted
After I spent all this money on a bridesmaid shirt?,Robin
"Did I bet someone that they'd call it off? I did, didn't I? Who'd I bet?",Barney
You actually expect any of us are gonna come to your third wedding?,Ted
"Yes. Because it's gonna be amazing. Look, before I was afraid to face Marshall's family and I didn't want to do all that work, but... Now that we're here... I realize that I have to face Marshall's family and I really want to do all that work.",Lily
"So do I. And yeah... My family might still be upset with you. But when they see us up there, they're gonna see how much we love each other and none of that other stuff is gonna matter.",Marshall
"I love you, Marshmallow.",Lily
"I love you, too, Lilypad.",Marshall
I now pronounce you man and wife.,Captain
What?!,Lily
Is that not right?,Captain
Are... we married? Did you just marry us? Weren't you listening? We don't want to be married.,Marshall
Uh... I-I suppose I could unpronounce you.,Captain
"All right, I unpronounce you man and wife.",Captain
"Oh, whew... That was close.",Lily
Hey... Ted.,Marshall
Is Robin here?,Lily
"Man, I hope so.",Marshall
You know how to make crepes? That is so cool.,Ted
"And then there was Derek and counting you, that puts the total up to...",Robin
"Oh, I got your total...counting along...",Ted
You're scared of the Seven Dwarfs?,Ted
"Just Doc. He's creepy. I mean, the guy went to medical school. What's he doing living with six coal miners?",Robin
"Oh, man, I'm so excited. I couldn't sleep last night. I bet you guys couldn't either.",Barney
Why?,Robin
"Ah, only the gala event for the grand opening of Sharper Image's 500th store. Didn't you get my email?",Barney
"No, I blocked your address after the fourth time you sent me the video of the monkey sniffing his own butt.",Robin
"Come on, it's on me! I'm buying three of you foot massagers and one of you a nose hair trimmer. You know who you are.",Barney
"Come on, let's go.",Barney
"All right, I'm in.",Robin
To the Willowbrook Mall!,Barney
"Oh, it's at a mall? I'm not going.",Robin
What? Why not?,Ted
I just don't feel like going to a mall.,Robin
We can split a cinnabun.,Lily
"No, I'm really not gonna go.",Robin
"Come on, it'll be fun.",Ted
"No, I don't go to malls! Sorry, I just don't like malls.",Robin
Why not?,Barney
I'd rather not say.,Robin
"Guys, guys, guys, Robin doesn't like malls. If she doesn't want to tell us why, she doesn't have to. I think we should all just respect her privacy.",Ted
Thanks Ted.,Robin
"So, what's the deal with you and malls?",Ted
"You said if I didn't want to talk about it, I didn't have to.",Robin
"Yeah, with those people. I'm your boyfriend. Come on, what is it? Did you get arrested in a mall?",Ted
No.,Robin
Dumped in a mall?,Ted
Ted.,Robin
Found out you were Canadian at a mall?,Ted
Let it go.,Robin
Trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Robin: Let it go.,Ted
Mauled at the mall?,Ted
"Let it go. And who gets trapped under a fake boulder at the mall? Ted: Not me in Ohio when I was nine, that's for sure.",Robin
"What, I don't get it, why won't Robin tell me why she hates malls?",Ted
"Ted, you should be happy Robin has a secret. The more you learn about a person, the better chance you have of hitting the fatal 'oh' moment.",Barney
The 'oh' moment?,Marshall
"Yeah, that moment when you find out that one detail about a person that is going to be a deal breaker.",Barney
Oh.,Barney
Oh.,Barney
Oh.,Barney
"So, trust me, you want to postpone knowing anything about each other for as long as possible.",Barney
"I disagree. If there's some potential 'oh' moment, I want to know about it right away. I mean, what's the alternative?",Ted
I now pronounce you man and wife.,Priest
I love you.,Ted
I used to be a dude.,Robin
"Yeah, I agree with Ted. In a real relationship, you share everything. That's why Marshall and I don't keep any secrets.",Lily
"You are such a cutie pie. Here's a quarter, go play something on the jukebox.",Barney
It's true. They tell each other everything.,Ted
I can think of tons of things there's no way Marshall told you,Barney
Try me.,Lily
Do you know about the time the Marshall was in Trenton?,Barney
Doggie ate his pants. Yep.,Lily
Bill's bachelor party in Memphis.,Barney
"Oh, when they had to pump out all the nickels from his stomach?",Lily
"OK, Seattle.",Barney
"Trick question, Marshall's never been to the Pacific Northwest because he's afraid of Sasquatch.",Lily
Damn.,Barney
I'm not afraid of Sasquatch. I just think we should all be on alert.,Marshall
"Trust me, not only do they tell each other everything. They want to know everything.",Ted
"So, after the shower, I was brushing my teeth, and I was like, oh man, I wanted to have some orange juice, I should have done that first, but I already had the toothpaste on the toothbrush so I just went ahead and brushed them anyway.",Marshall
What happened next?,Lily
"Fine, do you want to know what Robin's secret is?",Barney
You know?,Ted
"Of course I know. She couldn't look at us. Her face got flushed. That's shame. Our friend, Robin, used to do p*rn, wait for it, ography.",Barney
"Yeah, we didn't really have to wait for that. And it's ridiculous.",Ted
"I don't know, he could be right. She does have the fake orgasm noises down.",Lily
Hey.,Ted
What? The walls are thin.,Lily
That's not what I'm hey-ing you about.,Ted
You know what it might be. This is gonna sound a little crazy but what if robin's married?,Marshall
Married? What does have to do with the mall?,Ted
"Well, maybe she got married at the mall. Back home in Minnesota a ton of people would get married at the Mall of America, it's great. It's a gorgeous indoor golf course for pictures. Numerous fine dining options, and talk about a reasonable price...",Marshall
We're not getting married at the mall.,Lily
Just meet with the guy.,Marshall
She's not married. Robin hates marriage.,Ted
"Because she already got married, at the mall.",Marshall
"No, because before Robin moved to New York, she...What was she doing?",Lily
"Well, I don't know, whenever I ask her about Canada, she kinda clams up.",Ted
She's a pretty private person.,Marshall
Except when she's talking about...,Lily
A friend of mine in Canada got married way too young and it really turned her off to marriage.,Robin
What do you think of this wedding cake?,Lily
"Oh, I like it. Hey, you remember that friend of mine in Canada who got married too young? Her wedding cake was a Mrs. Field's giant cookie.",Robin
No.,Lily
"My friend in Canada who got married way too young, they had to do their vows twice, once in French.",Robin
They speak French there too? God! That place is a mess.,Barney
"So, you don't think there's any friend from Canada?",Ted
"Oh, I'm sure there is. Just like I have a friend who wet his bed till he was ten. Use your brain, Ted.",Marshall
"Guys, there's not way Robin's married. It's ludicrous to even suggest it.",Barney
Thank you Barney.,Ted
'Cause it's p*rn.,Barney
I need another beer.,Ted
Robin is not in p*rn. I'll bet you anything that she's married.,Marshall
"20,000 says it's p*rn.",Barney
"I don't have 20,000.",Marshall
"Well then, what do you have?",Barney
Well.,Marshall
No.,Lily
I got it. The ultimate wager. Slap bet.,Barney
"Oh, slap bet. We used to do those when I was a kid.",Ted
What the hell's a slap bet?,Lily
"Whoever's right gets to slap the other person in the face as hard as they possibly can, but no rings.",Marshall
Are you really gonna do that? That's so immature. Marshall: You can be Slap Bet Commissioner.,Lily
"Oh, I love it. What are my powers?",Lily
"Um, if a problem arises and we need a ruling, that's your job. Barney: But you have to be unbiased and put the integrity of slap bet above all else. This is an honor you will take with you to your grave. On your tombstone, it will read Lily Aldrin, caring wife, loving friend, Slap Bet Commissioner.",Marshall
"And your tombstone will read, got slapped by Marshall so hard, he died.",Marshall
"All right, what if I ask Robin point-blank if she has a husband?",Ted
You said you would respect her privacy so maybe you should just drop it.,Lily
"Yeah, you're right.",Ted
Husband.,Ted
There's no 'p' in husband.,Robin
"Wow, you seem to know a lot about husbands.",Ted
"Fine, I'll take it back.",Ted
"Oh, hey, since you mentioned husbands, this is great, you're gonna love this. Marshall, you know Marshall. He thinks that the reason you didn't wanna go to the mall the other day is because you got married in a mall and have a husband in Canada.",Ted
Huh.,Robin
"I told him he's crazy because he's crazy, right? I mean, how crazy is that?",Ted
"Are you asking me if I'm married? Ted: You can ask me. Nope, I'm not married. Your turn.",Robin
"What happened to respecting my privacy? Ted: Just say, no, I'm not married.",Robin
"Ted, I don't understand why you can't...",Robin
"Just say, no, I'm not married.",Ted
"I can't. Marshall's right. I was young and I got married. It was a mistake and he moved away, but, yeah, I'm married.",Robin
Oh.,Ted
You have a husband? Robin: I was young and stupid and we got married at a mall and we broke up at a mall and I haven't been to a mall since.,Ted
Why didn't you get divorced?,Ted
"He moved to Hong Kong for work and I was like, good enough.",Robin
"Good... good enough. That's not good enough. You order pancakes and you get waffles, that's good enough.",Ted
I haven't seen him in years. It's just a part of my life I wanna forget. Just please don't tell anyone about this.,Robin
OK.,Ted
Your hand is monstrous.,Barney
"Well, what did you expect? You've seen my penis.",Marshall
I can't believe you told us Robin's secret.,Lily
How can I keep something like that to myself? And you begged me to tell you.,Ted
No I didn't.,Lily
"Please tell us, just tell us. I'm begging you. Tell us, tell us, tell us, please, please, please, please, please.",Lily
"Fine, Robin's married.",Ted
Ha ha ha.,Marshall
"Yeah, well, you still shouldn't have told us. I mean, what kind of boyfriend are you?",Lily
"See, that's just it. I'm not the boyfriend, I'm the mistress. No, not the mistress. The mastress. Master. What do you call it?",Ted
I'm pretty sure we're gonna call is mistress.,Barney
What am I gonna do? My girlfriend's married. Do I ask her to get a divorce?,Ted
"Ted, even if she is married, it's a Canadian marriage. It's like their money or their army. Nobody takes it seriously.",Lily
It's serious to me.,Ted
"You know what, in some countries, if you've been separated for longer than five years, technicall, you're no longer married. I can check it out at the law library at school.",Marshall
I can see my hand print on your face.,Marshall
"Don't get too cocky, Slappy. I just got a shipment of p*rn from Canada I have to go through.",Barney
I won the bet. Why are you still searching?,Marshall
Just because you were right doesn't mean I'm wrong.,Barney
"Oh, right, like you need an excuse to watch p*rn.",Lily
"Canadian p*rn. Trust me when I tell you their universal health care system doesn't cover breast implants. If I have to sit through one more flat-chested Nova Scotian riding a Mountie on the back of a Zamboni, I'll go oat of my mind.",Barney
Hey.,Ted
"Hey. Listen, dude, I gotta talk to you, but you gotta promise me that you won't tell Barney.",Marshall
"Fine, I won't tell Barney. What is it?",Ted
Robin's not married.,Marshall
"What? Then, why would she tell me she was?",Ted
I don't know but I cross-checked every record in Canada. There's no record of her ever being married.,Marshall
There must be some mistake.,Ted
"I promise you, she's not married. She's not great at parking legally either.",Marshall
"So, she lied to me? What, what am I gonna do? I can't confront her 'cause then she'll know I told you.",Ted
"You gotta lawyer her. You gotta ask her a bunch of questions, try to trip her up, maybe make her feel guilty, whatever it takes to get a confession out of her.",Marshall
"Thanks for telling me your secret. It means so much to me that you could be so, what's the word I'm looking for, honest.",Ted
Thanks Ted.,Robin
"Yeah, you know what's probably the best part about your honesty? How truthful it is.",Ted
I say we just move on.,Robin
"In order for me to get total closure on this whole my-girlfriend-has-a-husband thing, I think I'm gonna need a little bit more information. Like, what month did you get married? Robin: June. We had a June wedding.",Ted
"Ah, Canada in June. That's great.",Ted
Sit down or buffet.,Ted
Um...,Robin
Whoa. It's weird that you don't remember.,Ted
"No, I just didn't know how to answer because we did butlered hors deouvres in the atrium, but the actual dinner was a buffet in the food court featuring a filet mignon or roasted potato-crusted salmon with a lobster scallion ber blanc.",Robin
Hm. Band of DJ?,Ted
"String quartet played at the ceremony, but for the actual reception we had a seven-piece band. We paid extra for the sax 'cause I just love that smooth alto sound.",Robin
How many bridesmaids? Robin: Seven.,Ted
Flowers? Robin: Azaleas.,Ted
Color scheme?,Ted
Dusty rose and sienna.,Robin
Husband's name?,Ted
Um.,Robin
You were never married.,Ted
Yes I was.,Robin
No you weren't.,Ted
How do you know?,Robin
I looked it up at the library.,Ted
What library?,Robin
The one on 5th.,Ted
When did you go?,Robin
Today at lunch. And I had a an apple brie panini with potato salad....,Ted
"I'm not questioning the lunch part, Ted. What database did you use?",Robin
I used the Canadian Mall Marriage 6000.,Ted
You told Marshall?,Robin
You lied to me!,Ted
"See, this is why I don't tell people secrets. You were supposed to be the one person I trusted the most and even you couldn't keep a secret.",Robin
But it was a fake secret.,Ted
"Yeah, I was testing you and you failed, and now you're never gonna know why I never go to the mall. And it's good too.",Robin
"Testing me, that's insane.",Ted
"Oh yeah, how long did it take for you to tell Marshall my biggest secret in the world?",Robin
That wasn't a real secret.,Ted
"Yeah, but it could have been.",Robin
You are driving me crazy. No wonder your fake husband moved to Hong Kong.,Ted
He moved there for business.,Robin
"You, you got something to say to me?",Barney
What are you talking about? Barney: I know Robin was never really married.,Marshall
How could you possibly know that?,Marshall
"Uh, let's see. Uh, first, I took the subway to school, and I got a bagel. Then I went to the library and found out Robin was never married. Crazy. And then I was hungry again so I went down to the vending machine...",Marshall
"You told him? Lily: I had to. I'm Slap Bet Commissioner. Baby, this hurts me more than it's gonna hurt you.",Marshall
Don't count on it. I've been practicing on a tree trunk.,Barney
Barney gets three slaps.,Lily
Three?,Marshall
One because you lied. And two for being prematurely slapped. Three slaps.,Lily
Oh my God. Are you gonna cry? Marshall: No. You're gonna cry.,Barney
I just don't think it's healthy to keep big secrets in a relationship. My parents didn't really talk to each other for thirty years and now they're divorced.,Ted
"I have shared more of myself with you than I have ever shared with anyone. I'm asking for this one secret, which has nothing to do with us, to just be mine.",Robin
So I just got a very interesting phone call.,Barney
What are you talking about?,Ted
I know Robin's secret.,Barney
What?,Robin
"That's right, I know your secret, Robin. Or should I say Robin Sparkles? Robin: How do you know that name? Barney: 'Cause I know the truth. And I am about to show it to you right now.",Barney
"Gather around, Ted, you're gonna wanna see this.",Barney
Yeah. No I don't.,Ted
What?,Barney
Robin wants to keep this a secret so it's gonna stay a secret.,Ted
"Yeah, it's not gonna stay a secret. You see, in my research, I came upon a certain gentleman in Malaysia who is in possession of a certain video tape. He just emailed me that it will be up and running on MySpace in about, right now!",Barney
"Robin's world is about to be turned upside-down. I mean, I'm guessing.",Barney
"Barney, don't, okay.",Robin
"Robin, please don't panic. I'm only going to show enough to prove to Marshall that I was right.",Barney
"No, Barney, I said we're not watching this.",Ted
"No, it's time. Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do but if it's out there, there's no point in trying to hide it anymore. Let's just watch it and be done with it.",Robin
Are you as terrified as I am?,Lily
I don't wanna get slapped again.,Marshall
I wanna stress that I was young.,Robin
Yeah you were.,Barney
And I didn't know any better.,Robin
They never do.,Barney
And it started out as an innocent modeling job.,Robin
It always does.,Barney
Oh my God.,Ted
"Well, obviously, I've been proven right, so in the interest of Robin's dignity, I won't show anymore. Plus, it's getting late. It's already slap o'clock.",Barney
What the hell was that?,Robin
"I slap bet Marshall that you did p*rn, so I win.",Ted
"p*rn? I wish it was p*rn, it would be less embarrassing.",Robin
I was a teenage pop star in Canada.,Robin
This is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.,Lily
That's you?,Marshall
Yes. I had one minor hit. I had to go all over Canada and sing this song in malls. For a whole year I lived off of Orange Juliuses and Wetzel's Pretzels.,Robin
This is the 90's. Why does it look like 1986?,Marshall
The 80's didn't come to Canada till like '93.,Robin
"Taking a break from the first of many viewings, I can't help but notice that this isn't p*rn.",Marshall
And yet a slap occurred without the permission of the Slap Bet Commissioner.,Lily
Looks like someone suffered from premature slapulation,Marshall
"Oh my God, Robin's rapping. Guys, Robin's rapping.",Ted
"OK, I'm going to give you a choice. Either ten slaps right now in a row or five slaps that can be doled at any point from here to eternity.",Lily
Go with the 10 now.,Ted
"No, wait, why get 10 when you can get 5?",Robin
"Yeah, but the constant fear of knowing that at any moment you can get slapped in the face would drive you crazy.",Ted
I'm gonna go with the five for eternity.,Barney
Good call.,Robin
Horrible call.,Ted
"Relax, dude, I'm just going for my soda, man. Take it easy. This is gonna be fun.",Marshall
"So, just to be clear, you wanted everybody to go to the mall today?",Lily
"Wow, we're gonna watch this a lot. Robin: I even wore a bedazzled jean jacket.",Barney
"Hey, just so you know, 16-year-old me would have been all over you. You could have been the girlfriend in Canada I told everyone I had. Hey, I'm really sorry I pried this out of you. I probably should have left it alone.",Ted
"You know what, you know me better now. That feels kinda nice.",Robin
That's one.,Marshall
Did you have to laugh like that every time? Robin: Yes.,Barney
But don't forget the robot.,Robot
The robot! Hey!,Marshall
"No, she doesn't wanna wait.",Ted
Hi. Have you met me?,Barney
"Well, boys, you look different because when I was pregnant with you, I only ate vanilla ice cream. And when I was pregnant with you, can you guess what kind of ice cream I ate?",Mere
He was a little bit way into black guys.,James
"Okay, great. How 'bout you instead?",Barney
Just because James is getting married doesn't mean things are going to change.,Marshall
- And not be groped!,Lily
"And then Tom says to the dealer that the handmade Georgian clock has a chip on the corner. Blam, we get that puppy half price. What up?! Bam!",James
"Oh, my God. I'm gonna be an uncle?",Barney
Right. - Hello?,Ted
"Uh, not you, Charity. I meant the less fortunate. Ted, how would you like to say grace tonight?",Stacy
Sex is fun.,Barney
Then you didn't lose your virginity to him. Just barely doesn't count.,Lily
"Look, I got to go.",Molly
"Yeah, and that shirt with the flowers, I get hay fever just looking at it.",Co-worker
We accept.,Marshall
"Make it like a dollar or something, you know. Who cares? No big deal.",Marshall
I know who won.,Doug
I can't go. I've got this thing.,Barney
"One second, Ted. Um, you know, a lot of people ask me that. The truth is,",Robin
I knew it!,Man
That's right. I saw it with my sister.,Ted
"Kids, there's more than one story of how I met your mother.  You know the short version, the thing with your mom's yellow umbrella. But there's a bigger story. The story of how I became who I had to become before I could meet her. And that story begins here.",Narrator
"...Dary! Legendary! Dude, I am so excited that you're single again. We're going to conquer New York City. I already have a girl from work lined up for you. Right boob bigger than the left boob, which some choose to look at as bra half empty. I choose to look at as bra half full.",Barney
I dont' know... Robin and I broke up two weeks ago. I'm... I'm not ready.,Ted
When will you be ready?,Barney
"It was a good question.  After a big relationship ends, you need some time to recuperate. Robin took a trip to Argentina, and I went through my usual routine. ",Narrator
I grew my breakup beard.,Narrator
"Ted Mosby, suit up, 'cause here's the plan. There's a Miss Nassau County pageant. We'll pretend to be judges and, yes, our votes are for sale.",Barney
I'm not ready.,Ted
I repainted the apartment.,Narrator
Finish line of a woman 10K. Salty girls on an endorphin high who just want to lie down. Yeah.,Barney
I'm not ready.,Ted
"And the truth is, I was doing really good.",Narrator
Female acrobats from Montreal. Super flexible. We're going to get Cirque de So-Laid. What up?,Barney
"Barney, come on, we've covered this.",Ted
Robin!,Lily
"Hey, guys. I just got in last night. Um, uh, this is Gael.",Robin
Hola.,Gael
"Okay, I'm ready.",Ted
"I just can't believe her.  We have this totally amicable split, everything's cool. And she comes back from vacation with THAT guy? You know what she's doing? She's trying to win the breakup.",Ted
"What do you mean Win the breakup, old timey inventor.",Lily
"What our 21st president, Chester A. Arthur, is trying to say is that in every breakup there are winners and losers.",Marshall
"It's not a competition. Now, your 80-day ballon race around the world, that was a competition.",Lily
That's my wife.,Marshall
"Of course it's a competition, Lil. How else do you explain... what's his name?",Barney
Gael.,Gael
"I'm sorry, Gayle?",Ted
Gael.,Gael
Kyle?,Barney
Gael.,Gael
Girl?,Marshall
It's pronounced guy-el.,Robin
"It's means joyful. That is why I live my life by bringing joy, good energy and happiness to others. Especially those less fortunate that I.",Gael
I'm sorry. So it's Gayle?,Ted
What a jerk? I don't go to your stupid country and try to seduce woman with my sexy accent.,Ted
"That's a great point, Persian nightclub owner.",Barney
"And, oh, he is a masseuse.",Ted
With a massage everything is connected. I can touch your foot cleanse your kidney. I can touch your earlobe and slow your b*at.,Gael
"One time I used warm water to make a guy pee. Of course, I didn't make a career out of it.",Ted
Career? Such an American idea. My career is living. Windsurfing. Making love. Sometimes at the same time.,Gael
"How? How would one do that exactly? Seriously, don't giggle. Tell me.",Barney
Not possible. You cannot have sex on a windsurfing board.,Barney
How do you know?,Lily
"Glad you asked Lily. I have crafted a list of every vehicle land-based, aquatic and airborne in which/on which it's possible to have sex. And of those 33 vehicles, I have had sex in/on 31. Windsurfing board, not on the list, not possible. Oh, P.S., in order to hit 33, all I need is bobsled and the Apollo 11 space capsule.",Barney
"To get that last one, you'd have to break into the Smithsonian.",Lily
This conversation never happened.,Barney
"All right, you're suit up, I bearded down. Let's get out there and win this thing.",Ted
Yes!,Barney
"You guys, have fun of your duble date.",Ted
"Oh, for the hundredth time, I'm sorry, there was a lull.",Lily
And then we fell asleep on the beach while counting the stars.,Gael
"Do you want to have diner with me? Uh, us?",Lily
There was no lull. You just think he's incredibly hot.,Marshall
"No, I don't!...Not incredibly. It's a little hard to believe how hot is he. But I mean, she isn't serious about him. The girl never marries the hot guy.",Lily
"Well, you did.",Marshall
I'm one of the lucky few.,Lily
"Lily, Ted is our best friend, so let's get something straight: Male Gayle is not hot. He's not our friend. Don't even look at him. Just... no eye contact.",Marshall
"So that night, as Lily and Marshall did their best to hate Gael...",Narrator
"Hey, Robin.  Gael.",Lily
"...Robin pulled me aside to check in. Now, I'm sure, she meant the best, but she said the worst.",Narrator
I just want to make sure you're okay with this.,Robin
"I just want to make sure you're okay with this? Damn it! I can't believe she's the one that gest to say that. She's winning, isn't she?",Ted
"Hum-hum. Not for long. Okay, pep talk. Take a knee. Ted, tonight, we're going to get you someone way hotter than Robin. Okay, Robin's a ten. Fine we'll get you a 12. Or, you know... two sixes. Failing that, four threes. And break glass in case of emergency we'll go the Staten Island, I'll get you 12 ones. Ted, my boy, I'm going to re-teach you... Ah.",Barney
Amy.,Amy
Ted.,Ted
"Barney. Ted, we are back. Up here. Up high. Fivin' it up five-style!",Barney
Weird? Why would it be weird? Because you used to date our best friend or because my wife thinks your new boyfriend is incredibly hot?,Marshall
"I do not! Shut up! Oh, my God!",Lily
I just hope Ted's okay.,Robin
Hmm.,Marshall
"I hate to see you so tense.  I mean, we had a really clean break up, you know? We really acted like adults, so the last thing... Oh! Oh, God, oh!",Gael
"Gael, are you properly licensed massage therapist?",Marshall
What?,Gael
Are you legally certified by some type of gouverning entity?,Marshall
I train for three years at an institute in Buenos Aires. I have a card. I can show you.,Gael
Is the card laminated?,Marshall
What do you mean laminated?,Gael
Covered in protective plastic.,Marshall
"Oh, yes.",Gael
Damn it!  He checks out...,Marshall
Ted. Ted. Ted. Ted. Ted.,Barney
What?!!,Ted
"Let's bail, this place is dead.",Barney
"Yeah, you're right. We're both totally striking out.",Ted
"Yes, exactly, plus, we're on a tight schedule. I've got the entire evening perfectly planned out... Spoiler alert: Our last stop is an after hours club so after hours, it's three days from now. What up?",Barney
Are you blind? I'm making out with a 12. I am winning.,Ted
Yeah. But I didn't get to help.,Barney
So you're saying you want me to throw away a super hot girl just because you didn't help me get her?,Ted
Apology accepted. Let's go.,Barney
Who's the suit?,Amy
"Hum. This is Barney. Barney, Amy.",Ted
"I'm not gonna remember that. Now, if you'll excuse me, random chick from earlier tonight, as you shall henceforth be known. Ted and I have a schedule to keep.",Barney
"Oh, well. You can check out off 08:54, dress up like a dork and bother the cool kids. b*at it, nerd.",Amy
"Wow. Wow. Great stuff, Tommy Lee. See what you don't understand is, I'm Ted wingman. It's a sacred bond, much stronger that any... They're making out again!",Barney
"Massage therapist. And you know what, Gayle? Your piece of chicken looks a little tense to me. Oh, oh, does that feel good, Mr. Chicken? Well, guess what? I didn't wash my hands. Got him.",Marshall
Lily?!,Marshall
We carry so much ancient emotion in our neck and shoulders. Things we should have let go of years ago.,Gael
"Oh, I forgive you, Mom.",Lily
"Lily, we are Ted's best friends. Our job is to hate that guy.",Marshall
"Oh, yeah, that's what I was doing. I was building him up so few minutes later, I could totally cut him down.",Lily
Weren't you wearing a bra?,Marshall
The night was doing great. Amy was cool and dangerous. She found a friend for Barney. She even paid for drinks...  sort of.,Narrator
They know us here! You're gonna get us in trouble.,Barney
Tell me something. Do you ask your tailor to leave extra room in the crotch for your huge vagina?,Amy
"You... your vagina... Ted, this chick is crazy. We're leaving.",Barney
Good idea. Let's all go back to my place.,Amy
"Your place? Thanks, but no thanks, 1994 Courtney Love.",Barney
I have a hot tub.,Amy
"Okay, this place is actually pretty nice.",Barney
I like your tatts.,Ted
Thanks. You can play with them if you want. They're a hundred percent real.,Amy
"No, your tatts... toos. Your tattoos.",Ted
"Oh, thanks. You should get one.",Amy
"Wrong. Ted has a classic clean-cut look that never goes out of style season after season, burn.",Barney
Yeah? Well. I think he would look hot with some ink.,Amy
"No, he wouldn't.",Barney
"Yes, he would.",Amy
"No, he wouldn't.",Barney
Yuh-huh.,Amy
Nuh-uh.,Barney
Ted. Who are you gonna side with on this tattoos thing?,Barney
I think I'd look way hot with some ink.,Ted
"Yeah, you would.",Amy
Yeah.,Ted
"Oh my God, Tyler?",Amy
Mommy! Daddy! She's back.,Tyler
Damn it! They're supposed to be in the Hamptons. Run!,Amy
Sorry. I used to nanny for those jerks before they fired me. So unfair.,Amy
"Unfair? I wouldn't let you take care of the imaginary kids I make up to score with single moms. That's it Ted, we're going home. Ted? Ted, you okay?",Barney
"Hello, Ted. Robin and I are about to make fantastic aquatic sex on this windsurfing board.",Gael
"And I just want to make sure you're okay with this.  Okay, how do we do this?",Robin
"I think your leg goes up, up...",Gael
"Okay, how 'bout if I, um...",Robin
"No, mine...",Gael
"I'm okay. In fact, here's how okay I am. I'm gettin' a tattoo.",Ted
"You're not getting a tattoo. It's not you. Ted, you are heading down a dark path.",Barney
That dark path is my driveway.,Ted
But you need a plan and you need a wingman!,Barney
This is so going in my blog!,Barney
Okay.,Barney
"Oh, fire. We should start a fire.",Amy
"After this maybe. Oh, man, this is going to be legen... wait for it...",Ted
"And that's all I remember.  The next morning, I woke up alone back home. ",Narrator
"Hey, buddy, how was your night?",Marshall
"You know, it was great. I met this crazy girl, I almost got a tattoo. Don't worry, I didn't. But it was... It was amazing. I think it's safe to say, I am winning this breakup.",Ted
Look.,Lily
Oh my God!,Marshall
What?,Ted
Nothing. This J. Crew catalog. Who brings two golden retrievers in a canoe?,Marshall
We've gotta call Barney.,Lily
Way ahead of you.,Marshall
"Hey, guys, what's the big emergency? Oh and B the W: I am never speaking to Ted again.",Barney
"Hum. Really, never? Not even if, say, butterflies flew out of his ass?",Lily
What?,Barney
Hum. Ted? Could you grab me the fondue pot?,Marshall
He has no idea.  And up we go.,Marshall
Thank you.,Marshall
Hum. Hum. What?,Ted
Ted?,Barney
Hmm?,Ted
I came here this morning because... I want to apologize.,Barney
"Apology accepted, Barney. As you can see, I do just fine on my own. I don't need a baby-sitter.",Ted
"See. All this time, I thought you need a wingman to fly, but the truth is you... you've got your own wings now.",Barney
Hmm.,Ted
"Since you and Robin split, you've been gestating. Growing in your cocoon. And last night... you burst out of that cocoon..., like a majestic, uh... gosh, what is it that comes out of a cocoon? I was always bad at science.",Barney
He's gonna say it.,Lily
A butterfly?  What?,Ted
"Nothing, buddy.",Barney
Ow. Why did that hurt so...? Oh my God!  I have a tattoo.,Ted
"Oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp.",Barney
Tramp stamp?,Ted
"You know, a ho tat. Ass antlers. A Panama City license plate.",Barney
And suddenly it all came back to me.,Narrator
"Mm, I just broke up with my boyfriend Steve. He was totally annoying. He was like, I think you're the one, I want to marry you.",Amy
What a wuss. Do you think exes can be friends?,Ted
"Yeah. Sure, I mean, we're still friends, right Steve?",Amy
"Hey, your name is Steve. And her ex-boyfriend's name is Steve. What are the odds of that...? Wait.",Ted
No no no no no no no. Give me this.,Ted
"Oh, yeah, that'll get it out.",Barney
Maybe you should try club soda.,Marshall
"Oh, damn it, it really hurts. I need like, some ointment or something. What is this? Spanish massage oil. Spanish massage oil? What happened here last night?",Ted
Last night got weird.,Marshall
Feel the emotions release.,Gael
Think I just got over being chunky in the ninth grade.,Marshall
You're beautiful.,Gael
I am beautiful.,Marshall
Experience your food.,Gael
Try the mango.,Gael
"Okay, that's enough of the fruit.",Gael
"We're sorry, Ted. It'll never happen again.",Marshall
It meant nothing to us. It just felt really really really good.,Lily
I can't even look at you two right now.,Ted
Ted.,Marshall
He got a tramp stamp. ,Lily
Okay.,Robin
"Good. Now, here's the thing. It sucks that you came back from Argentina with someone as awesome as Gael. And I know I have no right to be upset at you. We're broken up, life goes on, whatever. But you know what? We-we never did this. We-we had this polite breakup with no irrational yelling and that's just wrong. So I'm gonna yell irrationally for a while and you're just gonna have to stand there and deal with it, okay?",Ted
"If you feel like you need to do that, then...",Robin
"I think I do! I really think I do! So now, I'm yelling!",Ted
You shaved.,Robin
I did.,Ted
I like the beard.,Robin
"I liked it too, but it was getting kind of hot. Maybe in the winter, I'll grow it back out!  Okay, I'm done.",Ted
I know it was weird showing up with Gael. I'm sorry.,Robin
"Look, us breaking up, it was the right thing. But it took some time to get over you, you know? I-I'm still getting over you. But you, you were over it the minute they started the in-flight movie.",Ted
"Over it? My first three days in Argentina, I cried my eyes out. I missed you so much. I wanted to go and prove how adventurous I am, but the truth is, it was really lonely. And that's why Gael happened.",Robin
You weren't trying to win the break-up?,Ted
I was trying to survive it.,Robin
"Okay. No. See, look, that all sounds good, and we'll still be friends and move on, but..., did he have to be so hot? The guy's an Adonis.",Ted
He's not an Adonis.,Robin
He's the Cadillac of rebound guys. Marshall has a crush on him. The guy's perfect.,Ted
He's not perfect.,Robin
"Oh, come on. He's hot, he windsurfs, he massages things. Name one way I'm better than that guy.",Ted
You're bigger.,Robin
"Don't patronize me. If anything, he may even be a little bit taller.",Ted
"No, Ted... you're bigger.",Robin
"Kids, I can't remember exactly what helped me get through the whole Robin-Gael incident. I'm sure it was something profound and meaningful and not at all macho and petty. But after that, I was back on my feet. And what followed was a new era in my life. A crazy time unlike anything that came before.  It's funny looking back on those days, knowing now exactly what I was heading towards, and what was heading towards me.",Narrtor
Go for Barney.,Barney
"Hey, man. It's Marshall. Check your e-mail. Sent you something.",Marshall
What is it?,Barney
Just a new website. Slapcountdown.com.,Marshall
What does this mean? Marshall? Ma...?,Barney
No.  No!,Barney
"So, beeing married, different? Not different?",Ted
"It's the same. Mostly, except I think I might be getting carpal tunnel. My hands keeps cramping up.",Marshall
I think the whole point of getting married was that you didn't have to do that anymore.,Barney
"No, it's from writing all the thank you notes. Mostly.",Marshall
"Yeah. You're writing constantly. There's forms we have to sign, our death folders, thank you notes...",Lily
Whoa. Whoa. What are death folders?,Barney
It's this thing they recommend you do in case one spouse died unexpectedly.,Lily
It's all the information your spouse might need all in one convenient location.,Marshall
"Yeah. Account info, important addresses, a letter to the other person, all that stuff. I'll get the next round.",Lily
Thanks.,Ted
I am such a jerk.,Marshall
"Yeah. Wait, why?",Barney
I didn't know that I was supposed to write a letter. All Lily's gonna find in that folder are a bunch of bank statements and a funny list of things to do with my ashes.,Marshall
Marshall brownies.,Ted
"Number six. Yeah. Oh, God, I am a bad husband. No, uh, no, I'll just write, I'll write Lily a letter tonight, everything'll be fine.",Marshall
"That's right. Unless... you die between now and then. Ooh. But, come on, that's never gonna happen.",Barney
"Yes! There is one thing we can state with absolute certainly, it's that Marshall Eriksen is not going to die before writing that letter.",Ted
"No way at all. In fact, I dare God to smite down this perfectly healthy...",Barney
"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! I get it, okay, you guys know I'm a little superstitious, and you guys are trying to freak me out. Well, guess what? It didn't work. So, there.",Marshall
You guys are jerks!,Marshall
"Away from her normal home, her normal life, and it turns out, her normal self.",Narrator
"I was just so uptight in New York, you know? I mean, down here everybody shares everything. It's like we're all one big shimmering ball of positive energy. I wonder if anyone's ever thought that before.",Robin
Here. Eat. If we run out of fish I will catch more with my hands.,Gael
A drum circle! They're different every time. Let's go watch!,Robin
And here I am at the drum circle.,Robin
"Whoa. Are you topless? Ted, check this out.",Barney
Seen 'em.,Ted
Wow. It seems like a great trip.,Lily
"Oh, it was. I feel like the Robin who left is not the same Robin who came back, you know.",Robin
Wow. There's a lot of nude people in here.,Lily
"You haven't changed, Scherbatsky. You're a sophisticated, scotch-swilling, cigar-smoking, red-meat-eating, g*n new yorker.",Barney
Just shoes and a shirt. That's a look.,Lily
"What you are not is a massage-giving, windsurfing, bongo-playing, teetotaling, vegan, peacenik, hippy like you soon to be ex-boyfriend, Gael. Back me up here, Ted.",Barney
I'm just happy Robin's happy.,Ted
Thank you.,Robin
"Man, this is like Where's Waldo of exposed genitalia. Except that it's really easy to find Waldo.",Lily
"I'm evolved, and I'm enjoying living my life a little bit closer to the way Gael and I did in Argentina.",Robin
"Please, vacation romances have an expiration date. Gael's got a Best if banged by sticker on him. Once your romance starts to stink, you'll dump his ass down the drain like sour milk and go back to being Unevolved Robin, the one we actually like. Back me up here, Ted.",Barney
I'm just happy Robin's happy.,Ted
"I'm telling you, within three days...",Barney
"Ooh, here he comes. Switched to big words.",Lily
"Within a triad of solar periods, you'll recognize your dearth of compatibility with your paramour and conclude your association.",Barney
My journey was transformative and I reassert my commitment to both the aforementioned paramour and the philosophies he espouses.,Robin
What are we talking of? Baseball?,Gael
"This is all gonna returns to masticate you in the gluteals. Support my hypotehesis, Ted.",Barney
I'm just jubilant my former paramour's jubilant.,Ted
"That night, Marshall, sit down, to write the letter he hoped Lily would never have to read.",Narrator
"My windsurfing board... it had floated away. And the shark... he was getting closer. They say to escape you punch a shark in the nose. But I said... Brother shark, we are both children from the same earth mother.  And that's all I remember until the hospital.",Gael
That guy...,Barney
Yeah. That guy. Look at how easy he has it.,Ted
"Well. You and me, we have to bend over backwards to get a woman to, well, bend over backwards. But that guy... every woman in the bar is hanging on his every slightly mispronounced word. And why?",Barney
He's better looking than us.,Ted
No. Because he's from out of town.,Barney
Mmm.,Ted
"Yeah. Plus a*t*matic out, you're leaving in a couple of days. God, I wish we were tourists.",Ted
Yeah. Actually... You know where I've been meaning to visit?,Barney
"Okay, okay. We're from a small town in the south of France. Our plane leaves sunday morning.",Ted
"Uh, hey, uh, howdy, ladies. Hate to bother you. We seem to be a little bit lost. Would you happen to know which street the statue of liberty's on?",Barney
Oh.,Ted
"Oh, it's right. And, thank you very... Uh, my name is, uh, Ignatius Peabody Nobel, from East Westerton, Missouri. And this is my friend... Ted.",Barney
"Hi, um, I'm Colleen.",Colleen
"Hi, Colleen.",Barney
This is Lindsay.,Colleen
"Hi, Lindsay.",Barney
"So, hey, you-you ladies, been awful nice to us. What do you say... ah, never mind. No...",Ted
"No, what is it?",Colleen
"Well, it's just we're leaving sunday morning. It sure would be nice to have some real New Yorkers show us around.",Ted
Yeah.,Barney
"Well. We're tonight, but... maybe tomorrow afternoon? Atfer lunch?",Lindsay
Well. Hotdog! Should we... you want to just meet here in front of Mac... MacLaren's pub?,Barney
"It's kind of a lame bar, but sure.",Colleen
Really? It doesn't seem that lame to me.,Ted
It's pretty lame.,Lindsay
I think it's cool.,Ted
We'll see you tomorrow.,Colleen
All right.,Barney
I'm just saying it seems like a kind of bar a lot of cool people would hang out there.,Ted
Okay. All right.,Barney
"So, Gael, huh?",Lily
Mmm.,Robin
Still going strong?,Lily
"Yeah. It's great. Amazing, fantastic, awesome.",Robin
"Ooh, that's one too many. What's going on?",Lily
"Well, now that I'm home, I'm finding myself getting annoyed at things that I loved on vacation.",Robin
"Here, taste. Experience your food.",Gael
"Oh, so good.",Robin
Here taste. Experience your food.,Gael
"Ooh sofa! Ooh sofa! Sofa, sofa, oh... ooh ",Robin
"We're alone, now. I must have you.",Gael
Ooh.,Robin
I must have you.,Gael
Laptop! Laptop! Laptop! ,Robin
"And you know what else? I'm still finding sand everywhere. I mean, we haven't been to the beach since Argentina. Where is all coming from?",Robin
"Well, maybe you're just going back to the person you were before the trip.",Lily
"But I don't want to. I was so happy down there. No, you know what? I'm done complaining. I'm evolving. Just gonna go with the flow.",Robin
"Wow. Gael, you're peeing while I'm in the shower. Okay. Okay, old Robin would have been like, dude, ocupado. But now, you know what, I'm cool with it. Pee it up. In fact, when you're done, why won't you come in here and join me?",Robin
"Gael, there's some weird du..  Hello.",Robin
"Hey. Good news. I made some travelling friends today, and they'll be staying with us. How do you say... indefinetly?!",Gael
G'day.,All
Wow. Both sides. You wrote on both sides of a thank you note to my third cousin for a blender that you haven't even taken out of the box.,Marshall
"Wow, it's a really nice blender.",Lily
"Well, if you love that blender so much, why don't you just marry it.",Marshall
I can't. I married you. That's how we got the blender. What's wrong?,Lily
"Nothing. Nothing's wrong. What could be wrong? Except that when you die, I'm gonna find out that your parting words to comfort me for all eternity were Cancel Vogue.",Marshall
How can you open my letter?,Lily
"That was not a letter. It was barely even a text message. Next time you write something that short, at least have the courtesy to make it rhyme.",Marshall
"Marshall, wait.  This was our first fight as a married couple.",Lily
"Oh, baby.",Marshall
Oh.,Lily
"Kids, when you visited New York, there are count of something funny to see and do. And yes Colleen and Linsay took us to Tater-Skinz.",Narrator
This is our favorite restaurant in the city.,Colleen
"Yes, I'm sure this is the best of their 57 spudtacular east coast locations.",Ted
I'm going to run to the restroom.,Lindsay
"I'm gonna go, too.",Colleen
"This is the easiest date ever. You know what I'm gonna try next? A knock, knock joke.",Barney
Easiest? Somehow we have managed to find the two lamest new yorkers of all time.,Ted
"Ted, Ted, Ted. Dude.",Barney
I'm looking at you. What?,Ted
Right. Stay with me. We are on the cusp of moving from out-of-towners to in-their-pantsers. Ay-o?,Barney
"All right, Ignatius, one more hour.",Ted
"Nice.  Nice. Hey, nice.",Barney
Hey. Our friends invited us to a party. You guys want to come along?,Lindsay
"Knock, knock.",Barney
Who's there?,Lindsay
"Yes, we do.",Barney
"Quick announcement. I am so glad that you're here, fellow travelers. A couple rules... not even rules. Let's call them guidelines for harmonious living. Guideline for harmonious living number one ; The kitchen sink is for dishes, the toilet is for pee-pee. G.F.H.L. number two ; Marijuana is illegal in the United States, even when baked into a blueberry muffin that someone might mistakenly eat for breakfast right before they leave for their job as a TV Newscaster. This just in: Look at my hand, how weird is my hand? is not an appropriate thing to say on the air. And number three... I... .  And number three is please keep the noise to a minimum. I have to take a nap. I'm still pretty baked.",Robin
"Everything's so bright, even at night. No wonder the city never sleeps. ",Barney
"Hey. If we're going north, why did we cross over the FDR? We should have taken the Hudson.",Ted
Now he knows all the streets. Someone's been watching too many Steinfield reruns. ,Barney
Where are we even going anyway?,Ted
148th and Brook Avenue.,Lindsay
A hundred... on the south of Bronx at this time of night? We're going to get k*ll.,Ted
"Ted. I think these local new yorkers know more about the city than we do, so relax. We're in very capable hands.",Barney
"There were three of them, at least two g*n... they took all our money.",Ted
Well. I only had traveler's checks.,Barney
"Hey, babe. I've been thinking about our fight.",Marshall
Yes?,Lily
"I'm really, really... surprised that you haven't apologized to me yet.",Marshall
"Wow. You really want to open this up again. Oh, I forgot, you open everything up, even if you're not supposed to until I'm dead.",Lily
You know that is important to me. Why won't you just write the letter?,Marshall
"Because, I can't bear the thought of not being with you, not even for long enough to write you a stupid letter.",Lily
Really?,Marshall
"Yes, really. Plus, I know as soon as I write it, you're just going to open it up and read it again.",Lily
"Lily, I won't, I promise.",Marshall
Okay. I'll write you a letter for my death folder.,Lily
"Do you mind, um, maybe slipping in a little bit of dirty stuff, too?",Marshall
I tell you what. How about I make it all dirty stuff and slip in a little clean stuff?,Lily
You're the best. And maybe a couple polaroids?,Marshall
What?! This night couldn't have gone any better. We've just survived a mugging. You know what that means.,Barney
"Thank God, we're alive sex.",Ted
"Thank God we're alive sex. It's even better than I can't believe you just proposed to me sex, which I've only had, like, four of five times. Ted, please, we are so close.",Barney
All right. I'm in. I've never worked this hard for anything in my life.,Ted
Whew.,Ted
Wow. I think we all need to go back to our place and recover.,Lindsay
Yeah. I just want to celebrate the fact that we survived. You know?,Colleen
Mmm-mm. Me too. So where do you live?,Barney
What? West village?,Ted
Close. West Orange.,Colleen
West Orange? New Jersey?,Ted
Yeah.,Collee
"You guys live in New Jersey, not New York?",Ted
Theodore.,Barney
Yep.,Colleen
New Jersey?,Ted
Teddy?,Barney
"Yeah. But don't worry, it's pretty much New York.",Colleen
"Oh, no. Oh, no.",Ted
"Oh, no.",Barney
New Jersey is not pretty much New York. You are not pretty much new yorkers.,Ted
And how would you know?,Colleen
"Because I live here. That's right. I live here. Yes, we're full of crap. Yes, we pretended to be from out of town so we could sleep with you and leave in the morning. But you know what's even worse than that?! Saying you're a new yorker when you're not. Because, this is the greatest city in the world and you have to earn the right to call yourself a new yorker. So why don't you girls crawl into the open sewer pipe you call the Holland tunnel and flush yourselves back to pretty much New York? Because I will do a lot to get laid, but I am not going to New Jersey!",Ted
"You're not from Missouri? Well, I will be a monkey's unc...",Barney
Ew.  Can we get a ride?,Colleen
"Hey, um, sir, can we get ride, too?",Barney
"Newark, born and raised.",Policeman
Can you please keep it down?,Robin
Well. I have to have a job.,Robin
I'm canadian. You know that.,Robin
Wow. I just realized something.,Robin
"No, that you really suck. You're boring and lame and you're getting sand everywhere. Seriously, where is all the sand coming from? You're not the real me. All you are is me on vacation trying to get away from a break-up.",Robin
What are you doing?,Robin
"All right, everyone out! I said everyone out!",Robin
"All right, we're living, we're leaving, okay. Michael Moore was so right about americans.",All
I'm canadian!,Robin
"Robin, are you okay?",Gael
"No, I'm not. Listen, Gael, I need to talk to you about something.",Robin
"After they broke-up, Robin went back to being Robin.",Narrator
"Welcome home, Scherbatsky.",Barney
"Oh, good to be back. Although it's weird, vacation Robin popped into my dream again last night.",Robin
Listening.,Barney
This time we went all the way. Tell you one thing. She is maybe sandy but that chick knows what I like.,Robin
"Okay, I'm done... but I really don't want you reading this unless... you know, something happens. Can you swear to me you won't open it?",Lily
Totally. What does it say?,Marshall
"Marshall, I'm serious.",Lily
"Okay. I promise I won't, I won't open that until you're dead.",Marshall
Okay.,Lily
"And through 22 wonderful years of marriage, Marshall kept his promise.",Narrator
"Until November 1 of last year when, sadly...",Narrator
That's it? I suck. Lily.,Marshall
"Yes, you suck. You said you wouldn't read it and you did.",Lily
"Well, you didn't keep your promise either. I don't see any dirty pictures in here.",Marshall
"Oh, fine, I'll take the dirty pictures.",Lily
I don't want 'em now.,Marshall
What is that supposed to mean?,Lily
What?! Nothing. Nothing. You're beautiful. I would love the photos. Have I told you how beautiful you look?,Marshall
Oh my God. Barney...oh my God.,Ted
"Use your words, Ted.",Barney
"OK. Barney, I'm about to go for the belt.",Ted
The belt?,Barney
The belt.,Ted
But that's impossible. You were up here less than half an hour ago.,Barney
"Yes, advantage Ericksen.",Marshall
Don't get cocky. Wimbledon lasts a fortnight.,Barney
"Fortnight. British words are so cool. Plus, did you know lawyers there get to wear wigs? I wear a wig to work, I'm a jackass.",Marshall
"All right, I'm ready, let's hit it.",Ted
Can't go. Tournament.,Marshall
"What? We agreed, I suited up.",Ted
You take too long to get ready,Barney
"What are you talking about? I got the low-maintenance, just-rolled-out-of-bed look.",Ted
"Yeah, which takes an hour and a half of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve.",Marshall
And then he starts on his hair. Ace.,Barney
"Ha ha ha ha. Look, are we going or not?",Ted
"Just go without us, we'll be there in five minutes.",Barney
Really?,Ted
"All right, going down to the bar and ordering three beers, I'll see you in five minutes.",Ted
"3 beers, 5 minutes.",Ted
Thanks for lending me these boots. Where did you get them from?,Robin
"Oh, this store in the Village had one of those crazy sales. It was a footwear feeding frenzy.",Lily
I saw it first.,Lily
"You just made the list, bitch.",Lily
"So many questions. Firstly, what do you think would happen if a guy walked into that store wearing a suit of boots?",Barney
"You look fantastic in them, Robin. But don't you think they're a little high for that dress?",Lily
"Oh, that's the point. It's to hide the point that I haven't shaved my legs. I've g*n a strict no-shave policy for the first three dates. It's all about self-control. If I don't shave, I must behave.",Robin
"FYI, it doesn't matter, baby. Guys just wanna get on the green. They don't mind going through the rough.",Barney
Shekwakie.,Marshall
Stinson.,Barney
"All right, the beers are here.",Ted
"Yeah, we're not gonna make it.",Barney
"Oh come on, we agreed...Did Marshall take his pants off?",Ted
"Yeah, pants are off.",Barney
"This is Wimbledon, Ted. I need the freedom and mobility that only underwear can provide. Cheerio.",Marshall
"Fine, I don't need friends. I got you guys. You guys are my friends, my cold refreshing friends. I'm talking to beer.",Ted
Ted.,Trudy
Trudy.,Trudy
"Trudy. Oh my God, I haven't seen you since...",Ted
"I slept with you, then climbed down the fire escape?",Trudy
That was you? Kidding. I was super wasted... that night. These are not all for me.,Ted
"No, I was gonna call you but I was so embarrassed.",Ted
"You were embarrassed? I was like, I really like this guy and now I'm climbing out his window.",Trudy
And I forgot my underwear.,Trudy
"Those were yours? I thought they felt kinda tight. Kidding, I don't wear underwear, ladies underwear. Often. Again, I'm kidding.",Ted
I am so glad I ran into you.,Trudy
"I know, do you wanna get a...",Ted
"Trudy, no way!",Rachel
"Oh my God, Rachel, how are you?",Trudy
"Ted, this is Rachel.",Trudy
Hi.,Rachel
"Let me guess, you guys met in prison.",Ted
"No, we're sorority sisters.",Rachel
"And best friends forever, all sophomore year.",Trudy
When we weren't at each other's throats.,Rachel
We could be so competitive. But that's all behind us now.,Trudy
"Hey, mista...",Rachel
We have so much catching up do to.,Trudy
"OK, are you going to Stacy's wedding?",Rachel
"Oh, it's off, apparently he's into dudes.",Trudy
No! Again? That's like her third one.,Rachel
I know.,Trudy
"Well, beers, what do you want to do? Stay here, or I know this other place called my belly.",Ted
"So, Trudy and I got a table.",Rachel
"Oh, that's cool, I was gonna get outta here anyway, I'm really tired.",Ted
But I want you to stay.,Rachel
Tired of people who fold early 'cause I am wide awake.,Ted
"OK, guys, be cool.",Ted
"Kazouwee. Vanquished, old bean.",Marshall
That's 'cause you distracted me. You've been hanging crumpet ever since the third set.,Barney
Stinson.,Barney
"I've got a situation. Trudy is here, you know, the pineapple incident.",Ted
"You mean, the girl who chalked your pool cue and snuck down the fire escape.",Barney
"So, we're hitting it off and then her friend shows up and they're kinda competitive.",Ted
So you now have two on the line?,Barney
And I don't know which one to go for.,Ted
Go for the new girl.,Barney
"Given the choice, always party with Dr. Strangelove.",Barney
New girl? What new girl?,Lily
Two girls are allegedly vying for Ted's affections and I think...,Barney
"Oh, you don't know what you're talking about. Give it to me.",Lily
Are they friends? ,Lily
"Yeah. No, I don't know. They're old sorority sisters.",Ted
Are they Betas?,Lily
Because they're all sluts and you can tell them right now I didn't wanna be in their sorority anyway.,Lily
"They're Kappas and I think I can score with one of them. I don't know which one and if I choose wrong, I lose 'em both.",Ted
"OK, well, don't worry, I'll come down and help you figure it out.",Lily
I thought we were in for the evening.,Marshall
"That's what I thought about your bangers and mash down there but I guess we're both wrong, governor.",Barney
"Oh, Ted, OK, settle an argument. Is it stealing if you go out with someone's boyfriend after they've broken up?",Trudy
"Well, that's very complicated.",Ted
"See, he agrees with me. You're such a little man-thief.",Rachel
"You're the man-thief, man-thief.",Trudy
"Oh, somebody should lock you girls up.",Ted
You're so funny. I think Ted is funny.,Trudy
Really? I think Ted is hilarious.,Rachel
I am never not wearing a suit again.,Ted
Hello.,Ted
"It's me, I'm at the bar. Don't look, just call me mom.",Lily
"Hi Mom, how's dad's colon?",Ted
"What? What's the matter with you? Anyway, both of these girls are into you. Take your pick.",Lily
They are? Are you sure?,Ted
"Yes, of course. They're playing with their hair and touching your arm. Class green light.",Lily
Are you positive?,Ted
That is so fascinating. So what happened?,Robin
"Wow, gosh, separating conjoined twins. That must be the most amazing feeling.",Robin
That is so funny. You are so funny.,Robin
"Positive. They both want you bad. It's a clearance sale and you're the boots, baby.",Lily
"Oh, it's Robin. Good luck.",Lily
Bye mom.,Ted
My mom.,Ted
Hello.,Lily
Bring me a razor.,Robin
What about the no-shave rule? What happened to your convictions?,Lily
They've been surgically removed by Dr. Awesome.,Robin
"No, I'm not doing it. The whole point to not shaving...",Lily
"Lily, please, he's really cute and I really like him. And he's got a British accent.",Robin
I'm on my way.,Lily
"So, this college boyfriend, who, who won him?",Ted
Neither of us.,Trudy
"He left, junior year abroad.",Rachel
It's really too bad. There was that one thing we wanted to do.,Trudy
"We were gonna do, but never did.",Rachel
"What? What, what were you guys gonna do but never did.",Ted
"No, It's too embarrassing. You tell him.",Rachel
"No, you tell him.",Trudy
I don't care if you don't care.,Rachel
I don't care.,Trudy
"Nobody cares, just say it.",Ted
Why don't we tell him together?,Rachel
"OK, on three.",Trudy
One.,Trudy
"Well, he's right, it's a dead heat.",Lily
Two.,Trudy
Neither one is giving ground. I could not tell who was the third wheel.,Lily
Three,Trudy
It's a tricycle.,Ted
"No way, no way, no way!",Barney
What's happening?,Marshall
It's a tricycle.,Ted
"No way, no way, no way. It's a tricycle.",Marshall
"Well, I'll just say it right now, all sorority girls are sluts.",Lily
Put him on speaker.,Barney
So what you're saying to us right now is you have a sh*t at the belt?,Barney
"Wait wait wait, what belt?",Marshall
Barney and I have this running joke that the first guy to actually pull this off would win the championship belt.,Ted
"Oh, so it's a metaphorical belt, right?",Marshall
You actually bought a belt.,Ted
"That's right, it's resplendent.",Barney
"It's just a thing we said, we were kidding around.",Ted
"I never kid. Remember you said if I ever slept with that girl from Days of our Lives, I'd be the king? Well...",Barney
Why wasn't I told about the belt? I could go for the belt.,Marshall
"If Lily were to die before me, then I could ride the tricycle.",Marshall
"If I died, I'd just come back and haunt your penis.",Lily
"Guys, come on, help me out. What do I do?",Ted
"All right, Ted, if you're about to go for the belt, then the bylaws require me to ask the following questions. One, is the aggregate age of all the participants under 83?",Barney
Yes.,Ted
"Two, is the aggregate weight of all participants under 400 pounds.",Barney
Yes.,Ted
"Theodore Mosby, are you paying these women?",Barney
What? No.,Ted
Ted?,Barney
"No. Look, I gotta go. They're gonna think I inherited my dad's imaginary bathroom issues.",Ted
"Oh, are you guys leaving?",Ted
"Well, it is getting pretty late.",Rachel
"Right, well...",Ted
I thought maybe we could all go and listen to that Wilco CD you talked about before.,Trudy
"Great, I have it right upstairs. It's in my apartment upstairs. Let's so upstairs.",Ted
"I'm sorry, where was your apartment again?",Rachel
That's funny. I love that. You should tell more jokes at my apartment upstairs.,Ted
"Scenario number 12. We're in a horrific car crash, you die, I'm left paralyzed. Two sexy nurses with a six-pack of wine coolers sneak into my room late at night. I try to blink at them in morse code, Please, don't, I love my dead wife, but they're medical professionals and I gotta think somehow they're saving my life.",Marshall
"Fine, sleep with your nurses. Tonight you ride the unicycle.",Lily
I already did this morning.,Marshall
Hello.,Lily
"Lily, I have pounded three cappuccinos waiting for you. Pretty soon I won't have to shave, the hair is going to vibrate off my legs.",Robin
"Sorry, I can't leave now.",Lily
"Lily, he can't see my legs like this. I look like a Turkish lesbian",Robin
There is a pharmacy across the street. Would 20 bucks buy me a razor?,Robin
"No, but fifty will.",Waitress
"Oh, hold on. Ted's texting me.  We're combing upsars.",Barney
We're combing upsars? What does that mean?,Marshall
He's coming upstairs!,Lily
Where are my pants? Where's my pants!,Marshall
Got 'em.,Ted
"Ooh, nice place!",Rachel
"Hey, are these your roommates?",Rachel
"Yes, yes, but they are not here. They are somewhere else. We have total privacy because privacy is essential when you're listening to music.",Ted
You know what else is essential when you're listening to music? Music.,Rachel
That's hilarious. You are hilarious. I'll go get it in my bedroom. The CD's in my bedroom. Bedroom.,Ted
"OK, we'll try and stay out of trouble.",Rachel
Of course we can't promise anything.,Trudy
This is gonna be awesome.,Ted
No!,Ted
"What are you guys doing here? I've got, I've got...",Ted
"We know, we know, Ted. Well done, this is very impressive. Up top.",Lily
"Yeah bro, up top.",Marshall
"Oh, don't be gross.",Lily
"You guys need to get out of here right now. Please, take the fire escape.",Ted
"No, no way. The other day I saw a pigeon take a crap on it and the whole thing shifted.",Marshall
"Oh, you can use our bedroom.",Lily
"OK, all I need to seal the deal is the Wilco CD...Barney.",Ted
What are you doing?,Ted
I cannot allow Ted to do this.,Barney
"Why, why?",Ted
Because the belt is my birthright. You can't claim it before I do. That would be like Jimmy Olsen capturing Lex Luther while Superman watches impotently from the bedroom.,Barney
"But Barney, you've done way dirtier stuff than Ted. You're disgusting.",Marshall
"I've never ridden the tricycle. I was on the verge last year, it was so close.",Barney
"So, ladies, why don't we move this party to a more horizontal location?",Barney
I'll get the video camera.,Barney
OK then.,Barney
Let me get this straight. You're gonna trike block me? That is so petty. It's like you're...,Ted
Tom Petty.,Marshall
Tom Petty. You're Tom Petty.,Ted
Where's Lily?,Ted
"Still looking for that CD, so...",Ted
What are you doing?,Ted
I knew it. I had a hunch about that girl and I was right.,Lily
I saw it first.,Lily
"You just made the list, bitch.",Lily
"I cannot give up my bedroom to a boot thief. She should be punished, not rewarded.",Lily
"Fine, then I'll try to work in a little light spanking. Just do this for me.",Ted
"No, never.",Lily
"What if I reimburse you for the boots, full retail?",Ted
"Thanks, enjoy our bedroom.",Lily
"OK, take it.",Ted
Wish me luck.,Ted
Oh my God.,Barney
Where's the shaving cream?,Robin
"Well, you didn't ask me for shaving cream.",Waitress
"Well, it was implied. Who buys a razor without buying shaving cream?",Robin
"Well, who doesn't shave their legs for her date?",Waitress
"Well, who's not getting a tip because of her attitude?",Robin
"Well, here's a little tip for you. Shave your legs before you leave the house, Sasquatch.",Waitress
Absolutely. I just have to go to the ladies room. I've got TB...tiny bladder. I'll meet you out front?,Robin
You've gotta be kidding me.,Robin
Excuse me.,Robin
"So, I'm having a little trouble finding the CD.",Ted
"That's OK, we don't need music to have fun.",Rachel
Exactly.,Ted
"You do like to have fun, don't you Ted?",Trudy
"It's getting late, I'll get your coats.",Ted
"I'll get your coats? Ted: I don't know why I said that. Why did I say that? It's the opposite of what I meant. I wanna take clothes off them, not put more on.",Lily
"Ted, you're ruining this for everyone.",Marshall
Leave him alone! Sometimes even the greatest warriors sh**t themselves in the foot.,Barney
"What are you talking about? Barney: If you must know, it wasn't a freak beverage malfunction that stopped me from riding the tricycle that night.",Lily
"Oh no, the night's ruined!",Barney
Yes it is. Whatever this night was heading towards is ruined. Where's my coat?,Barney
Why would you do that to yourself?,Marshall
"Because you get up in your head, man. Start thinking, I can't do this. It's two women. That's two of everything, four of some things. The logistics alone are enough to cripple even a pro like me.",Barney
"See? If a complete degenerate like Barney choked, what chance do I have?",Ted
"The best chance in the world. Fear took the belt from me. Fear rode the tricycle that night, my friends. But fear will not get a second turn.",Barney
It won't?,Ted
"No, because I now realize it isn't my destiny to win the belt. It is my destiny to help my friend win it. Ted is fated to go there first. He is our Neil Armstrong.  Space-suit-up, Ted, 'cause you're going to the moon. Step 1.",Barney
"Ladies, couldn't find your coats but I did find tequila.",Ted
"Wait, wait wait, a remote control fire place? We don't have a remote control fire place.",Ted
I am so exhausted.,Rachel
So exhausted.,Trudy
Why would I want to tire them out?,Ted
That's your excuse to unleash pretext for physical contact number one.,Barney
You give the most amazing foot massage.,Rachel
It's 'cause I used to practice all the time on my grandmother.,Ted
Why in God's name would I say that?,Ted
"Ted, what's wrong?",Trudy
I was just thinking about this documentary I saw once about something called a supervolcano.,Ted
"OK, what the hell.",Ted
"OK, wait for it.",Barney
"Could happen at any time and obliterate all life on earth, which is why I live by three simple words. Don't postpone joy.",Ted
Oh my God.,Rachel
That's so true.,Trucy
Yeah.,Ted
"Mortality angle, that's actually pretty good. I can do this.",Ted
Yes you can.,Barney
"I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I'm actually moved. Bring it in, guys.",Lily
All right.,Ted
I'll see you on the other side.,Ted
"So, what happened next? Did you do it? Ted: Doesn't seem right to talk about it.",Barney
What? No! Tell me. Don't tell me because you don't have to because you didn't do it.,Barney
"You didn't do it. You did it. You did it, didn't you? Did you?",Barney
"You didn't do it. Yes, you did. You did. No, you... Just tell me!",Barney
"Some stories you tell, some stories you don't.",Ted
"Because you didn't do it. He didn't do it. You did it, you did it, you did it. Tell me, did you?",Barney
"Ted, belt.",Barney
Did? Tell me. You know if he did it?,Barney
No problem.,Waitress
"No, nobody's in there, but the window's actually open.",Waitress
Why don't I buy you a drink?,Waitress
Did I overhear that you're a surgeon?,Waitress
You're so funny.,Waitress
"I'm here, I'm fine, my head is bleeding. Going down again.",Robin
100! We only got to 82 on our honeymoon.,Lily
"So, Robin, I've got a guy for you. He's cute, he's funny, he's smart.",Lily
What's his 'but'?,Ted
What do you mean? Ted: When someone wants to set you up they always tell you the good qualities first but then they leave out their huge flaw.,Lily
She's totally hot and really fun.,Barney
But she has a dead tooth.,Barney
She's superhot and she's so successful.,Marshall
But she has a pug that she pushes around in a stroller.,Marshall
She's so cute and she's so smart.,Lily
But her last boyfriend had to get a restraining order against her and then his cat and new vacuum cleaner both went missing.,Lily
"Wow, set it up.",Ted
I'm still convinced she k*ll my turtle.,Ted
"Hey, you know what, not every setup has a 'but'. What about, um, Jamie, that girl that Lily set you up with? She was really nice.",Robin
"If memory serves me, she had a huge 'but'. Her huge butt. Nailed it!",Barney
"Well, there's nothing wrong with this guy. He's really nice and he's really cute.",Lily
"But? Lily: Fine, but he has a kid.",Ted
Oh.,Marshall
Aha! There it is. Robin's not going out with a guy with a kid.,Ted
"But the guy is really great. And his kid's sweet, he's in my class.",Lily
Doesn't matter. Robin hates kids.,Ted
I don't hate kids.,Robin
"You told me even when you were a kid, you hated kids.",Ted
"OK, yes, kids are not my favorite thing in the world but I like them.",Robin
"Well, you don't wanna have them.",Ted
I like sports cars but it doesn't mean I wanna push a Ferrari through my vagina,Robin
g*n.,Barney
"You can't blame us for thinking that the kid would be a problem. I mean, if we were friends with Garfield, we wouldn't set him up on a date with Mondays.",Marshall
Nice.,Barney
"You know what, the kid is not a problem. I wanna meet this guy.",Robin
"OK, that's awesome.",Lily
"Yeah. Hey, what's my 'but'? You know, I'm really nice, but...",Robin
But she's afraid of commitment.,Ted
But she's a g*n nut.,Lily
But she's Canadian.,Barney
But she didn't like Field of Dreams.,Marshall
I can't think of anything.,Barney
You don't have a 'but'.,Ted
"OK, I've got it. Here, put on this eye patch.",Barney
Why?,Ted
The ultimate ice breaker.,Barney
"A bunch of cobras got loose in Central Park. You and I are jogging, training for the Death Valley Iron Man. No big deal, we do it every year. Suddenly we see these snake bastards sneaking towards a little baby. Not on our watch. You grab the kid, I strangle six cobras with my bare hands. Women of New York, one at a time please.",Barney
"So, what are the eye patches for?",Ted
We got bit.,Barney
On the eye? Barney: Yes.,Ted
Both of us.,Ted
They're different eyes. I don't see why this bugs you. Patch up!,Barney
"OK, here's the thing, George is a great guy, we had a wonderful date.",Robin
But?,Lily
Can't wait to meet him? Why did I say that? I don't wanna meet his kid.,Robin
"Well, you knew you'd meet him sooner or later.",Lily
"I was just hoping for later, like in 20 years when I'm a cougar and he's as hot as his dad.",Robin
"Robin, What's the big deal? He's just a kid. He's not gonna bite. He may bite. We're working on biting.",Lily
Why is this kid around anyway? Shouldn't he be with his mom? What kind of lawyer does this guy have if he has to take care of the kid all the time?,Robin
A good one. He won full custody.,Lily
"He won? He won. Oh God, getting the kid is winning, isn't it?",Robin
Don't tell anyone I said that.,Robin
"OK, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret. People with real game don't need eye patches.",Ted
"Oh, Theodore...",Barney
"...no no no, you can't spell game without me, and me has the best game.",Barney
"Yeah, well, I got so much game, I'm Cornish game hen.",Ted
Oh yeah? I'm the New York state gaming commissioner.,Barney
"Well, I'm The Game, well-crafted, keep-you-guessing thriller starring Michael Douglas and Sean Penn.",Ted
Wow.,Barney
Wow. You're here and not in stall two.,Marshall
"Yeah, so?",Ted
I may have made some wildly inappropriate homoerotic comments to a gentleman wearing your shoes.,Marshall
"OK, Marshall.",Barney
Yes.,Marshall
Which one of us has more game?,Barney
"Neither of you guys has any game, right, or else you'd be married like me.",Marshall
"What? Marshall: If dating is the game, then marriage is winning the game.",Barney
"Yeah, if you're playing in the women's league.",Ted
"You're joking. I have mad game, bra.",Marshall
"OK. One, we agreed not to ever say 'bra' anymore. It was a good week, we had a lot of fun, but it's over. Two, you've been with Lily for eleven years. You're idea of good game is slapping on a Dr. Seuss hat and flashing two tickets to a Spin Doctors concert.",Barney
"I hate to say it, buddy, but you're kinda' irrelevant.",Ted
What? I am not irrelevant. I know tons of stuff. I could help you guys. I don't wanna be left out.,Marshall
"Ted, you do not have more game than me. By sheer numbers alone, I win. Come on, dude, you've seen my list.",Barney
Do you guys wanna hear one of my lines?,Marshall
"First of all, I did not ask to see that list and I am still horrified. True game is about quality, not quantity. And a quality girl would pick me over you any day.",Ted
Are you a model? That one's good because it's flattering to the girl.,Marshall
"Ted, I challenge you to a picking-up-girls Olympiad.",Barney
Fine.,Ted
There will be 26 events spread out over 11 weeks. We will travel to a neutral city where a panel of international judges...,Barney
Or we could just choose a girl and the first one to seal the deal wins.,Ted
That's good too.,Barney
How about her?,Barney
You're on.,Ted
"Before we start, why don't we jot down a few basic ground rules?",Barney
"OK, great. Rule number one, no eye patches or props of any kind.",Ted
"One time I was with this girl and I tried that model line, and I totally got some over-the-shirt boob action at a Just Say No assembly.",Marshall
Just stop. You're bumming everybody out.,Ted
"Rule number two, this bet is for one million dollars.",Ted
I win.,Barney
How?,Ted
"Oh, I slept with her, about a year ago, I just forgot.",Barney
"Oh, well, that doesn't count. The bet started the moment we shook.",Ted
I can't sleep with her again. She hates me.,Barney
"Oh, Interesting. Look who just took a commanding lead. Now, with you out of the picture, I can take my sweet time.",Ted
"Ted, she's leaving.",Marshall
Get out of my way.,Ted
"By the look of those shoes, here comes your bathroom buddy.",Barney
Look who's got game.,Marshall
"You're a big kids person, huh?",George
"Only the biggest ever. I think kids are so great. Especially the little ones. You know, uh, pudgy, can't sit up, don't have teeth yet.",Robin
Babies.,George
"Yeah, I like that kind.",Robin
"Well, Doug's almost six",George
"Oh, six is great. You are gonna love six. Six is when they really start to...  I hate kids.",Robin
"Excuse me, what? Robin: I mean, I don't hate kids. I'm just not a kid person. I mean, yeah, it's cute that their shoes are real little, but beyond that, what's the draw? You must think I'm nuts.",George
"What? No no no. So you don't like kids, so what? I'm not looking for a mother for Doug. Why don't we just hold off on you meeting him?",George
"Yeah, let's take things slow.",Robin
"Hey, what's up?",Lily
"It's here, Lily. It's looking at me. The kid, what do I do?",Robin
"Just talk to him. You can do this, Robin.",Lily
Who are you? Robin: I'm Robin.,Doug
That's a bird's name.,Doug
No it's not. It's actually a type of bird.,Robin
"My friend, Patrick, has a parakeet named Robin, so there. You wanna talk in Morse code?",Doug
"Dude, I'm just reading my paper.",Robin
"Beep, beep beep beep, beep beep, beeeep. I'm starving. Can you make me cereal?",Doug
Sure.,Robin
"What are you doing? You're supposed to pour milk first? Robin: What? No, you pour the cereal first so you know how much milk you need.",Doug
It tastes better milk first.,Doug
It all tastes the same once it's in the bowl.,Robin
Why are you wearing my dad's pants?,Doug
Milk first it is.,Robin
"What are you reading? Robin: The business section. The Fed's gonna lower rates again to bail out these subprime lenders, bunch of idiots.",Doug
Miss Aldrin says it's not nice to call people names.,Doug
"Well, maybe if they weren't such idiots, I wouldn't have to call them that.",Robin
That's what I said. You're pretty cool.,Doug
You too.,Robin
"Well, have fun in yoga.",Ted
She's strengthening her core. That's gonna be good.,Ted
"Yeah, all right. After a while, crocodile.",Ted
You see this. Game face.,Ted
"Whatever, Ted.",Barney
"Oh, get this, she plays bass in a reggae band. They're having a show this Friday. How cool is that?",Ted
"Oh, does she know that one song? Mm-hm chaka, mm-hm chaka. What's that song called? Oh, right, it's called every reggae song.",Barney
"I am not irrelevant. I ran the numbers. If Lily and I have sex twice a week, which, let's be honest, we all know is being conservative. And we've been together for ten years plus seventeen more times on the honeymoon. Minus the two week drought when I said the checker at the grocery store reminded me of a young Lily. Then we have had sex a total of...wait for it...",Marshall
Nice.,Barney
"One thousand fifty-three and a half times...my mom called once. But that's more times than Barney has ever had sex and to your point, Ted, Lily is a quality girl. I win. Lawyered.",Marshall
Doesn't count.,Barney
Totally counts.,Marshall
"You're right, it counts. It counts as one. You've had sex once. How was it? Marshall: I still matter.",Ted
"OK, Ted, go win the bet. You have my blessing. She's a wonderful girl. I should know.",Barney
"Oh, OK, OK, I see what you're doing.",Ted
"We've never shared a woman, have we, Ted? Isn't that funny? You're with her now, I was with her a year ago. You figure for her, that's like 200 showers ago. You gotta ask yourself, Ted, is 200 enough? Ted: You know what, I don't mind. Barney: No, of course you don't mind. Just like the second guy to climb Mt. Everest didn't mind getting all the way to the top only to find Sir Edmund Hilary's flagpole thrust into its supple peak.",Barney
"No, I'm sure when you're with her I'll be the furthest thing from your mind. Kissing what I've already kissed. Nuzzling what I've already nuzzled. Going  on what I've already gone  on.",Barney
"Barney, I'm not afraid of catching your cooties, OK?",Ted
"Really? Ted's not afraid of cooties. OK, well then I guess you'd have no problem having a sip of my gin and tonic.",Barney
Fine.,Ted
And I only stirred that with my pinky.,Barney
"Guess who loves Robin? Kids, kids love Robin. Doug thinks I'm pretty cool.",Robin
"Really, that's great. You and George, all thanks to me.",Lily
"Yeah, I'm gonna have to break up with him.",Robin
What?,Lily
"Well, tt's just getting a little bit too serious with the kid. You know, it's just not what I'm looking for. So, better that I break it off now before he gets too attached.",Robin
What?,Robin
"I hate to tell you this but, too late.",Lily
He drew it in class today.,Lily
Oh crap.,Robin
"There's no way that's a picture of me. That woman has on hoop earrings, I don't even own hoop earrings. I have one pair and they're gold. Those are Fruit Loops.",Robin
You are so in denial right now. And you're doing what you always do in relationships.,Lily
We'll ask the guys. They'll tell you that's not me,Robin
That's totally you.,Marshall
You guys are totally crazy.,Robin
"Hey, who drew the picture of Robin?",Ted
It's not me.,Robin
"You're joking, right?",Marshall
It's not me.,Robin
My new mommy. Kinda has a nice ring to it.,Ted
"Hey, now that you're a mom, are you gonna start wearing those totally awesome jeans that go right up to your boobs?",Marshall
Do guys really think this is me?,Robin
"Honey, it's you. And if you're gonna break up with George, you have to break up with his kid too.",Lily
Really?,Robin
"Yeah, you can't just abandon him. You have to talk to him. Come on, Robin, you know it's the right thing to do.",Lily
"Man. Doug was right, you are a pain in the ass.",Robin
"So, I, I had a really nice time tonight.",Stacy
Me too.,Ted
Yeah?,Stacy
Mm-hm.,Ted
"Uh, Ted, something wrong?",Stacy
"Hey, Doug.",Robin
Are you here to see my dad? He's taking a shower.,Doug
"Actually, I came to see you.",Robin
"I wrote a poem, you wanna hear it.?",Doug
"Sure, why not?",Robin
"To my new mommy. You're pretty, you're nice, And you smell like daisies.",Doug
"Oh, that is so sweet, Even though it doesn't rhyme.",Robin
"Look, uh, Doug. There's no good way to say this.",Robin
"We need to talk. I just think, um, we both could use some space right now. It's not you, it's me. I know this hurts but you deserve someone better. I'm just really trying to focus on my career right now, you know. I just hope we can still be friends.",Robin
"Hi, I'm Brooke, I'm here for my date with George. You must be the babysitter.",Brooke
"I had so much coffee earlier, I need to run to the loo. Hey Dougie.",Brooke
What the hell was that? Doug: That was my new mommy.,Robin
"So, this picture is not of me?",Robin
Why would I draw a picture of you?,Doug
How many dates has she been on with your dad?,Robin
Two.,Doug
"Well, I've been on like five and you like her better?",Robin
We just really connected.,Doug
And what about me? You think I go around pouring cereal for every boy in town.,Robin
"Why are you getting so upset, Roberta?",Doug
"Robin. My name is Robin. Like the bird, remember?",Robin
Whatever.,Doug
"So, that's it, huh?",Robin
"Look, you're great, but...",Doug
"Yeah, there's always a 'but'.",Robin
"Well, I couldn't do it. I broke up with her. Thanks a lot by the way. A beautiful, sexy girl and all I could think about was you being there first. You were stuck in my head like a Chumbawumba song.",Ted
"Which Chumbawumba song? Barney: Well, what an interesting turn of events. It looks like I'm going to win.",Marshall
"What do you mean, win? You couldn't even talk to her. You tried, you got slapped.",Ted
That's what you think happened.,Barney
"OK, great, rule number one no eye patches or props of any...",Ted
Here's the deal. My friend just got dumped so he's a little shy but he'd love to buy you a drink and get to know you. The problem is he thinks a pretty girl like you won't go for a guy like him. So would you slap me across the face so he could see you're not into guys who feed you lines? What do you say? For my friend?,Barney
You are so sweet.,Stacy
"So now, whatever nice things Ted does for her, in her mind, I'm the guy who's even nicer than him.",Barney
So you never slept with her?,Ted
Not even at all.,Barney
"Wow, that's good.",Marshall
It gets better. Remember Ted's phone conversation?,Barney
"Well., have fun in yoga",Ted
Well?,Barney
Oh.,Barney
I'm sorry.,Stacy
"Stacy, right?",Barney
"Yeah. Oh, you're Ted's friend from the bar?",Stacy
"Yeah, wait, don't tell me you go to yoga here too?",Barney
I do.,Stacy
I'm gonna head out to a reggae concert. I'm a huge fan of reggae.,Barney
"Oh my gosh, I play in a reggae band.",Stacy
"No way, I wonder why Ted didn't tell me about that. Like I said, I'm a huge reggae fan.",Barney
After a while crocodile.,Ted
We are two peas.,Barney
"Wow, take care. Namaste.",Barney
You are a sociopath. That was my yoga mat.,Ted
"So now with Ted out of the picture, I'm gonna swoop in and take the whole thing.",Barney
"Translation: 'cause I got game, bitches.",Barney
"No, no, this doesn't prove anything because...",Ted
"Hold one, hold on a second. Stacy.",Barney
"Hey, stace. What happened? He did not. Stay there, I'll be right over.",Barney
I should have just worn that stupid eye patch.,Ted
I can't believe you got dumped by a 6-year-old.,Lily
"Whatever. He's a stupid head. I'm just, I'm done with kids.",Robin
Hey.,Stacy
"You know, I really appreciate how cool you've been about us taking things slow.",Stacy
"That's what makes you so special, baby.",Barney
"Anyway, I am so psyched to be playing Sun Splash tomorrow. We go on sometime between 11 and 6 so you probably wanna get there before nine to be safe. Oh, and it's gonna be muddy.",Stacy
"Everyone, this is Blah-blah.",Ted
Please call me Blah.,Blah-blah
"So, Blah, how did you two meet?",Marshall
"Well, I was taking this cooking class, French fusion, and everyone already had a partner but then I looked up, and across a crowded room, I saw Ted. It was magical.",Blah-blah
It was so magical.,Ted
She's gonna tell some bogus story about a cooking class because she's embarrassed we met online.,Ted
"Ay, Chihuahua.",Marshall
What? There's no stigma anymore.,Ted
"Oh, there's a stigma. That's why people always say there's no stigma anymore.",Robin
"So, she's hot.",Barney
"Oh, she's gorgeous.",Ted
Then she's crazy.,Barney
No she's not.,Ted
"Ted, the only hot girls that troll the Internet for dudes are crazy, hookers or dudes.",Barney
"OK, she's not crazy, she's not a hooker, she's not a dude. Though there's this guy I pass on my work every day who's all three, scares the crap out of me.",Ted
There's no way she's above the line on the hot-crazy scale.,Barney
She's not even on the hot-crazy scale. She's just hot.,Ted
"Wait, hot-crazy scale?",Robin
Let me illustrate.,Barney
A girl is allowed to be crazy...,Barney
... as long as she is equally hot.,Barney
"Thus, if she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.",Barney
"If she's this crazy, she has to be this hot.",Barney
You want the girl to be above this line,Barney
"Also known as the Vicky Mendoza diagonal. This girl I dated, she played jump rope with that line. She'd shave her head...",Barney
...then lose ten pounds.,Barney
She'd stab me with a fork...,Barney
... then get a boob job.,Barney
I should give her a call.,Barney
"OK, so please, just play along with her fake story. We met in a cooking class.",Ted
"I don't know, Ted, I don't know if I can just play along with your crazy girlfriend's fake story. Now, if you had said fake breasts...",Barney
She's not crazy.,Ted
"OK, we'll see.",Barney
"Long story short, thank goodness I'm such a bad cook or I never would have met Ted.",Blah-blah
It's crazy how cute that is. It's crazy.,Barney
You know who else has a really cute story of how they met? Marshall and Lily. You guys should tell that story right now.,Ted
"Yeah. Marshall: All right, but spoiler alert, it ends with everyone saying 'aw.'",Blah-blah
Aw.,Lily
Starts with it too.,Marshall
It was late August 1996,Lily
Lily and I were both freshmen moving into,Marshall
Ohhh.,Blah-blah
"I know, right?",Marshall
"Dude, this black-haired Goth chick stopped by today,  wanna tap that.",Marshall
"You guys are so lucky. You know, when Ted and I were cooking and our hands touched for the first time, I knew right then that after class he would take me up on the roof, kiss me and give me a rose, which he did.",Blah-blah
Saw 'aw.',Blah-blah
Aw.,Everyone
"I know, right? I'll get the next round, OK guys.",Blah-blah
"Anybody'd be stressed out meeting new people. She's not crazy. Crazy generous maybe, buying us drinks.",Ted
"No, no no no no no no no no no no no no no. Barney and I are not together. No. No.",Robin
Really? Sixteen no's. Really?,Barney
"So, you're single.",Blah-blah
Yeah.,Robin
"Hm. Oh, so, pretty and single and friends with Ted. Great.",Blah-blah
"You know who else is friends with Ted? Marshall. How did we meet? It's a good story, I'm gonna tell it right now. Uh, it was the first day of college.",Ted
I didn't realize Ted wasn't the dean until later that night.,Marshall
You're not the dean.,Marshall
"College, good times.",Robin
"Oh, I get it. Ted told you I didn't go to college so now you're giving me a cute little backhanded slap.",Blah-blah
"Oh, here we go.",Barney
"Well, while you were busy majoring in being freaking beautiful, I was starting my own line of handbags.",Blah-blah
Your own line of handbags? That's crazy.,Barney
"These have sold in Japan. Robin, have you ever sold anything in Japan?",Blah-blah
"Uh, no, but I would love to buy one of them if... Where can I get one?",Robin
"I don't have a distributor here yet, but thanks for rubbing that in. Why are you trying to undermine me in front of Ted?",Blah-blah
"Look, there's nothing going on between me and Ted.",Robin
"Wow, that just came out of nowhere.",Blah-blah
"No, I'm just saying you don't have anything to worry about.",Robin
I wasn't worried. Are you saying I should be?,Blah-blah
"No, I'm saying that you shouldn't be.",Robin
"Oh good, 'cause I'm not. Now, Robin, could you just let it go? You're making all of us really uncomfortable.",Blah-blah
"You know what else is a good story, how Barney and I met. Barney, tell that story, right now. Please.",Ted
"OK, Ted, this is a crazy story. You're gonna love it.",Barney
Tonight's the first time I'm taking my deaf brother out since our mom died.,Barney
"Oh, I'm sorry about that.",Ted
"No, it's OK. I have to take care of him now. Of course, I have had to put my dreams on hold in order to do it, but I'm happy to. He's my brother and I love him. I'm sorry, it's all still so fresh.",Barney
"Oh man, I'm really sorry.",Ted
"Wow, you bought that?",Barney
"What? Barney: I just made that up mid-pee. It worked on you, it's definitely gonna work on that blonde chick at the end of the bar. Unless you're a total idiot. What's your name?",Ted
Ted.,Ted
"Are you a total idiot, Ted?",Barney
"Well, I'm still having this conversation, so... Barney:  Well played.",Ted
I like you Ted.,Barney
"Ted, I'm gonna teach you how to live.",Barney
Barney. We met at the urinal.,Barney
"Oh right, hi.",Ted
"Lesson one, lose the goatee, it doesn't go with your suit.",Barney
I'm not wearing a suit.,Ted
"Lesson two, get a suit. Sutis are cool. Exhibit A.",Barney
"Lesson three, don't even think about getting married till your thirty. And lesson four, be totally silent for the next five minutes.",Barney
"Hey, Audrey, this is my deaf brother, Edward.",Barney
"Edward, this is Audrey.",Barney
"You know, I actually know some sign language.",Audrey
"Hi, my name is Audrey. Nice to meet you",Audrey
He doesn't sign. He's embarrassed by his hands. They're tiny and lady-like.,Barney
I'm Edward. Nice to meet you too.,Ted
What? You are over your hand issues. It's about time.,Barney
My brother's a great guy. You should give him your phone number.,Ted
Here. Call me.,Audrey
"And even though that girl ended up giving me a fake number, I knew that Ted and I would be each other's wingmen forever.",Barney
"Barney, it's time you knew, um, that story actually goes a little bit differently.",Ted
He's lying to you. Just give him a fake number.,Ted
"Great, funny. God, with a wingman like Ted, I might need to resort to meeting someone in a super desperate and lame way, like online. Online. Online.",Barney
"Oh my God, you told them.",Blah-blah
"OK, yes, I told them, but it's not a big deal. Lots of people meet on the Internet. That whole seeing a stranger across a crowded room thing, that only happens in the movies.",Ted
"Yeah, that never happens. Oh wait, except you and Robin. That's how you guys met, right?",Barney
"Wait, you guys dated. For how long?",Blah-blah
"A year. But don't worry, the relationship wasn't that good. By the end, it was mostly about sex, which was not that good. But I was the problem. I'd just lie there. Ted is very good. I'm sure he will get you where you need to go. Can I buy your bags online?",Robin
"Oh, I see what's going on here, Ted, I'm just some random girl to make Robin jealous and after she takes you back, you probably won't even remember my name.",Blah-blah
"Come on, blah-blah, it's not like that.",Ted
"Well, we're closing in on the half. Let's see how Blah-blah's doing on the crazy-hot scale.",Barney
She started the night here,Barney
"But as the night's progressed, she's gotten crazier but no hotter which has caused her to drift across the Mendoza diagonal and dangerously close to the Shelley Gillespie zone.",Barney
Another girl I dated. She gained twenty pounds and tried to k*ll me with a brick.,Barney
"I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but seriously there's nothing going on with me and Robin.",Ted
"Then why has she been trying to undermine me all night? I mean, look at her. She's laughing at me right now.",Blah-blah
"I'm sorry, it's just Lily and Marshall's story is so romantic. I just wish we had something like that.",Blah-blah
Their story is not as magical as it seems.,Ted
What do you mean?,Blah-blah
"No, I can't, it's kind of a secret.",Ted
"Well, how about I tell you a little secret about what you might get to do later tonight.",Blah-blah
"The night before Lily met Marshall, there was this party.",Ted
"As drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, she still remembered room 110. That's why she knocked on the door. She was looking for me.",Ted
Oh my God.,Blah-blah
"Yeah, and in all these years Lily and I have never spoken about it, so again, mum's the word, OK?",Ted
You have to tell Marshall.,Blah-blah
"If he heard that, it would destroy him.",Ted
"If you don't tell him, I will.",Blah-blah
"Oh, come on, you wouldn't.",Ted
Oh no.,Ted
"So, Lily, how did you and Ted meet? Come on, Lily, the real story.",Blah-blah
I don't think anyone wants to hear that story.,Ted
"Don't be embarrassed, Ted, it was a long time ago.",Lily
"Yes, that is the unabridged story of how Lily and I met. How embarrassing. Who wants another round?",Ted
"That's not the story, Ted, tell 'em.",Blah-blah
Tell us what?,Marshall
"Lily, will you help us get the next round?",Ted
"Ted, what's going on?",Lily
"She knows about us, about how we really met.",Ted
"Yeah, I know, I just told her.",Lily
"No, the real story.",Ted
"Ted, what are you talking about?",Lily
"Lily, come on.",Ted
Come on what?,Lily
"Lily, come on.",Ted
"Ted, I honestly don't know what you're talking about.",Lily
"Lily, come on.",Ted
I know that you and Ted made out the night before you met Marshall.,Blah-blah
What? Ted and I never made out.,Lily
"Yeah, we did.",Ted
"I only made out with one other guy in college before I met Marshall, and it was just some random dude. I don't even remember his name. I just call him too-much-tongue guy.",Lily
What? Too-much-tongue guy? I'm not surprised to hear that coming from unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.,Ted
That wasn't me.,Lily
"Yes it was, at the freshman orientation party.",Ted
"No, no no no no no no no no no no no.",Lily
"How much fun is this? All of us reminiscing about how we met me? Robin, have I told you how I met Marshall? Robin: Yeah, like five or six times.",Barney
It was right over there.,Barney
"Here's your problem, you've only slept with one woman. Those kind of stats are only okay if you're eleven. But tonight, we're getting you a new girl because Marshall Eriksen, from this moment on, I make all your decisions for you.",Barney
"I'm sorry, who are you again?",Marshall
"This is Barney, I met him the other day. He's kind of a jackass.",Ted
"I'm teaching Ted how to live, and lucky you, I have room for one more student. Think of me as Yoda, only instead of being little and green, I wear suits and I'm awesome. I'm your bro. I'm bro-da. And tonight you are gonna use The Force to get the hottest chick in this bar into bed.",Barney
"You're gonna use force? 'Cause that sounds wrong, bro-da.",Ted
"No, The Force. It's a Star Wars reference.",Barney
"So we should make lots of Star Wars references around girls, that's what you're saying?",Ted
I'm not gonna cheat on my girlfriend.,Marshall
"Yes, you are, with the hottie that just walked in. Look at her.",Barney
"How much hotter is she than your girlfriend? Marshall: There's no comparison. What do you think, Ted? Go for it? Ted: Oh, don't do it, man. Think about Lily.",Barney
"You know what, I don't care. I've been with one woman for too long. I need me some strange.",Marshall
"Yes, yes, pep talk. You can do this, but to be more accurate, you probably can't. You're way out of practice and she is way too hot for you. So, remember, tonight isn't about scoring, it's about believing that you can do it even though you probably can't. Go get him, tiger.",Barney
Poor guy's gonna crash and burn.,Barney
That man is a god.,Barney
"For like a week after, Barney followed me around, asking me to teach him how to live. I even got him to do my laundry once.",Marshall
I thought it was a Mr. Miyagi kind of thing.,Barney
"Marshall, I need to talk to you. Can we go somewhere in private?",Lily
"Yeah, of course, what's wrong?",Marshall
"Lily and Ted made out. What do you think of that, Robin? Marshall: What are you talking about? Lily: You know that guy I made out with at the freshman orientation party?",Blah-blah
Too-much-tongue guy? Yeah.,Marshall
And you know that girl I made out with at the freshman orientation party?,Ted
Unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl? Yeah.,Marshall
I'm too-much-tongue guy.,Ted
And I'm unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl.,Lily
Worst superheroes ever.,Barney
"Baby, I am so sorry.",Lily
"I don't think you need to be. I was at that party. It was dark, and granted, I had eaten quite a few sandwiches but I'm a hundred percent sure that unreasonably-small-mouth-opening girl was Alexa Leskies, it's not Lily.",Marshall
"Really? Marshall: Yeah, I'm positive. And too-much-tongue guy was Colin O'Riley.",Ted
"Are you sure? Marshall: If it wasn't, I peed in the wrong guy's shampoo, man.",Lily
"You don't really believe that, do you? You swore it was Lily.",Blah-blah
I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa.,Ted
"Another girl, Ted? Who haven't you made out with? You know what, I don't need this. I design handbags. I'm writing a memoir. I'm a superstar. This is totally my year. Someday the name Blah-blah will be up in lights. Ted, next time you're online playing World of Warcraft, don't even think about chatting with me.",Blah-blah
World of Warcraft? The online role playing game? That's how you two met online?,Barney
"Yeah, it's really, it's a cool game.",Ted
I guess I made a mistake. Must have been Alexa.,Ted
"So, Ted, remember the last time we were here?",Alexa
You and me? No idea.,Ted
"Ted, come on. Freshman year, we were both pretty drunk?",Alexa
That was you?,Ted
I know.,Lily
So I am not too-much-tongue guy.,Ted
Actually.,Alexa
No.,Ted
Look what I've confiscated from some kids.,Marshall
That is a fat sandwich.,Ted
"I know, right?",Marshall
"Chew chew chew chew, swallow.",Marshall
"It's all right, honey.",Marshall
Sandwiches are strong these days.,Lily
I can't believe I used to be able to eat a whole sandwich by myself. Now it's like two bites and I am done.,Ted
"Baby, can we grow sandwiches behind the garage?",Marshall
"Dude, we're 42.",Lily
Where's my wife?,Ted
It was a quiet november afternoon in 2007.,Narrator
"I was working from home, because, you know, no distractions.",Narrator
This is incredible!,Barney
Oh my God! I can't believe it!,Marshall

"Okay, you know, cute coincidence, Barney. Whatever. I just got on the phone with the NR...",Marshall
Oh my God. This totally explains the thing at my doctor's the other day.,Ted
All right. Let's meet your new doppelganger. Or should I say doppel banger.,Barney
"Guys, guys, guys! Can I tell my news? It's pretty...",Marshall
This is really bizarre. The only other famous Mosby I know was a confederate general during the civil w*r.,Ted
Probably not the same guy.,Barney
"You got the job! Oh, yeah!",Ted
"The NRDC, or natural ressources defense council, fought for preserve american clean water, fresh air and to preserve's america's wilderness. It was Marshall's dream job.",Narrator
"Congrats, buddy.",Ted
Thanks. It's kind of weird hugging with p*rn on.,Marshall
"Yeah, it really is.",Ted
"Oh, hey, hey-o. New guy entering the cockpit. Could it be the navigator, Ted Mosby.",Barney
"Uh, no. No, navigators have three stripes on their hats. Captains have four. That guy's a captain.",Ted
"Yeah, and I'm sure complete accuracy in all those details was very important to the directors... Dirt and skank, the raunch brothers.",Barney
"Baby, I have some exciting news.",Marshall
I hope it's not that you just won some sort of race here.,Lily
I got the job at the NRDC.,Marshall
Wow.,Lily
And I found a porno starring Ted Mosby.,Barney
"I know, right?",Barney
"Oh, congratulations, Marshall!",Robin
Congratulation for us all.,Barney
"Oh, let's go celebrate.",Lily
The fact that I found a porno starring a guy named Ted Mosby... Let's do it!,Barney
"Oh, is that him? Cause that Ted Mosby really knows what he's doing.",Robin
"No, that's not him. What do you mean, that Ted Mosby really knows what he's doing?",Ted
"Oh, no! No, I meant, that Ted Mosby, he really knows what he's doing. Like all Ted Mosbys.  Wow, NRDC! Way to go, Marshall.",Robin
"But you're still gonna go to your job interview today, right, baby?",Lily
"Marshall had an interview  at a firm called Nicholson, Hewitt and West.  They represented, well, pretty much everybody Marshall was going to sue  once he started at the NRDC.",Narrator
I'm not doing that interview. Those people are evil.,Marshall
"Marshall, your dad went through a lot of trouble to set this up. You can't just pull out at the last second.",Lily
Apparently you can.,Robin
"Ted, Ted, Ted, guy in the hat! Three stripes, ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ted Mosby, p*rn star.",Barney
I know what kind of plane this is. It's a boing.,Robin
"See, this is way better than Marshall's intership.",Barney
It's a real job.,Marshall
"Who is this guy? Are we related? Do, do I look like him?",Ted
"Hmm. It's hard to tell. Go, go like this.",Marshall
Oh yeah. A little bit. Yeah.,All
More around the eyes.,Barney
"Oh, I do see that.",Robin
"And here's you water, in case you're dehydrated, Ted Mosby.",Wendy
"Ah, ah, very funny, Wendy. Now we know you watch p*rn.  This Ted Mosby must be getting kind of famous.",Ted
"Hmm. You're not wrong.  According to the web site, of the far superior Ted Mosby... he's been in the business three months, and he's made 125 movies.",Barney
"Wow. That's 42 movies a month. Who is he, Jude Law? Right? He makes a lot of movies. I mean, not so much lately, but maybe, like, two years ago, you couldn't go to a movie without...",Robin
Shh.,Ted
"Adult Video Weekly? Oh, no...",Ted
Hello?,Ted
"Hi, I'm looking for Ted Mosby. It's Leonard Ross from AVW.",Leonard
Oh my God!  AVW? It's architecture vision weekly.,Ted
"Well, that's a bummer. Anyway, I'm calling to interview you about your latest project.",Leonard
"Well, I don't want to say it's my project. I mean, I'll be working with at least three partners.",Ted
Oh! Group scene. Always fun.,Leonard
"Yeah. Yeah. I'm really looking forward to it. I mean, I know they're gonna ride me pretty hard but they're great guys.",Ted
"Guys? Oh, wouah, there's a scoop.",Leonard
That interview went on for 20 more minutes.,Ted
"This project was so demanding, I can't tell you how many nights I spent bent over a table.",Lily
"Oh, hey, baby, how'd the interview go?",Lily
"Um, interesting. There I am in the office of Jefferson Coatsworth and I figure I'm not gonna take this job anyway, I might as well give this old bastard a piece of mind. Jefferson Coastworth wasn't what I expected.",Marshall
"Marshall, Jefferson Coastworth.",Jefferson
Hello.,Marshall
"Dude, I am so, so psyched that you're here. Can I beer ya?",Jefferson
"Marshall was thrown. This guy seemed nice. Of course, he wasn't.",Narrator
Go to hell! I'd do it again!  I'm innocent. I'm innoncent.,Jefferson
"Marshall, why don't you want to work at Nicholson, Hewitt and West?",Jefferson
"Right, um, okay, Jeff, I've actually given this a lot of thought...",Marshall
"I'm sorry. Stop. I can't do this with a straight face. You don't want to work here. You're only here 'cause your dad went to high school with Joe Hewitt. Fact is, you just got a sweet job at the NRDC. And it's awesome. Man, I could have gone the non-profit route. I didn't. And it eats me up inside every day. I hate myself. I hate myself.",Jeff
"Oh, he is good. Classic seduction technique.",Barney
What do you mean?,Marshall
"Oh, I use it all the time. First I buy her... and by her I mean you... a drink. Now, I'm the guy who gets her what she wants. Then I pretend to care about whatever idiotic thing she cares about. For you, that would be the enviroment. Now, I'm the great guy who shares her interests. And before you know it, you're naked in my apartment, shouting oh-oh Bar-r-r-ne-e-y! And by you, I mean her.",Barney
He is not trying to seduce me. He didn't even offer me the job.,Marshall
"That comes later. At dinner. He did invite you to dinner, didn't he?",Barney
"Let me buy you a dinner. Tomorrow night. As a thank you, okay? You'll tell me all about the NRDC, and we'll charge it all to one of my evil clients.",Jeff
"I, you know, I don't know if...",Marshall
"Marshall, you know what kobe beef is?",Jeff
The most expensive beef in the world.,Marshall
The place I'm taking you has kobe lobster. That is lobster fed with kobe beef.,Jeff
Oh my God. He's trying to seduce me.,Marshall
So are you gonna go to dinner with him?,Robin
No. No way. I promise myself to the NRDC. I'm not that kind of lawyer.,Marshall
"Oh, you should go. I mean, you're not gonna take the job, but you might as well get a great meal out of the deal.",Lily
Don't wait up.,Barney
"Guys, guys, guys, check this out. Ted Mosby p*rn star's bio says his hometown is your hometown. Shaker Heights, Ohio.",Robin
"What? Okay, this is getting creepy. Who, who is this guy? I gotta find him.",Ted
"Well, it's your lucky day. He's gonna be signing autographs tomorrow night in Manhattan at something called the Adult Video Expo.",Robin
"Hmm. Wait, are you telling me that they actually have conventions for p*rn?",Lily
Affirmative. Or to put in another way... God bless America.,Barney
You can really taste the beef in that lobster.,Marshall
"Right, listen, I know we're only here to screw over my client, who quite frankly deserves it... hum, but I gotta be able to tell the guys upstairs I gave you the spiel, okay? So, first up, starting salary. .",Jeff
"Okay. Here we go. This is the big number that's supposed to impress me and...  whoa, that's a BIG number.",Marshall
"There's also a signing bonus, uh, use of a company car, expense account, blah, blah, blah. Hey, by the way, turn around and wave to Patrick Swayze.",Jeff
"Hey, I'm going to, uh, try to remain cool. But you know Patrick Swayze?!",Marshall
"He's a client. Who do you think bought us this wine?  Crazy, Swayze. Cheers, buddy.",Jeff
"Okay, no. Jeff, this is all very impressive, but I just don't think that...",Marshall
"Listen, I know, I know. You are not gonna be tempted by big numbers and fancy perks. You're gonna do the noble thing, take the low-paying job at the NRDC, live off you family money.",Jeff
Family money?,Marshall
"You do have family money, don't you?",Jeff
"No, hum, not that I know of. I do have an uncle who owns a, a pretty successful bait shop.",Marshall
NRDC. No family money. Hum. So you don't plane on having kids?,Jeff
"Actually, I want to have four kids.",Marshall
"Well. New York public school make a lot of parents nervous, but the kids who walk out, walk out proud.",Jeff
"He was surely doing a tough decision. Now, kids, when I'm faced with a tough decision, I like to make a list of pros and cons. Marshall knew all cons.  But there is one thing he didn't know, a big guy live in a pros con.",Narrator
"Lily, you're a kindergarten teacher?",Robin
Yeah.,Lily
Cause Robin was about to ask Lily the one question...,Narrator
"And you make a kindergarten teacher's salary, right?",Robin
Yeah.,Lily
That Lily had been dreading for years.,Narrator
"Well, how do you afford all of these expensive clothes?",Robin
I shop the sales. There were in the closet when we moved in. I steal. I'm a criminal. I once sh*t a man just to watch him die.,Lily
Lily?,Robin
"Oh, okay.",Lily
That's when Lily showed Robin her box of shame.,Narrator

"When you get married you start out growing certain parts of your life; and for Lily and Marshall, those certain parts were, for the most part, me.",Narrator
Why could you come in? you hear me shaving!,Ted
I thought you were shaving your face!,Lily
"Well, clearly i wasn't!",Ted
"Guys, it's 3:00 in the morning and it reeks in here.",Marshall
Ted said it was okay.,Robin
"Discontent was bubbling under this surface, until one day...",Narrator
"Ted! How many times have i asked you to put the lid back on the peanut butter jar?  It's this sort of incoiderate, immature jackassery that makes me feel like i'm living in the Realworld house, and not the early years when they all had jobs and social consciences. I'm talking about Hawaii and after! I can't take this anymore!",Marshall
"But still, it was time to move forward. So they set out to find a new apartment to rent.",Narrator
"Hey, here's one. Private building, recently renovated, hardwood floors, tons of light, two bedroom, 2 bath.",Marshall
"Oh yeah, but that one's not for rent. It's for sale!",Lily
Oh right!,Marshall
"Kids, uncle Marshall always like to say that he made 3 big mistakes in his life. This was the first . This was the second . And this was the third and biggest.",Narrator
You should buy a place!,Marshall

"Baby, real estate is always a good investment!",Marshall
It's not!,Narrator
And the market is really hot right now.,Marshall
It wasn't.,Narrator
"And because of my new job, we are in such a strong place financially.",Marshall
They weren't. 'Cause Lily had a secret.,Narrator
Hy! My name is Lily and I'm a shopaholic.,Lily
"I buy designer clothes and accessories that i can't afford. I have 15 creditcards and they're all maxed out. And no one outside of this room, not even my husband, knows. And i feel terrible because all i want to do right now is ask you  where you got those shoes? They're adorable.",Lily

"Ro, don't let Marshall fall in love with this apartment.",Robin
"I know, i know, i know, i know! But what do i tell him?",Lily
"I-I don't know, tell him, tell him you saw a ghost. Tell him it's haunted.",Robin
You really don't know Marshall at all.,Lily
"I see. Between you and me, i'm also interested in this apartment. So is there any way i could come back later and check it out while you'rte showing them other places?",Barney
Are you serious? You're trying to sneak this apartment away from Marshall and Lily?,Ted
"Ted, do you think i have no morals whatsoever? I simply want to fool a girl into thinking this is my apartment so i can nail her once and never have to see her again. I'm not a monster!",Barney
"I see what you're doing here. another couple, please, that crap is page one out of the Realtor's playbook. And we're not buying it.",Marshall

"Yeah! They're a chinese couple that wanted a white baby, it works both ways. Cookie?",Barney
You got me. My sisters taught me how to bake and how to listen.,Barney
"I'm glad. Sometimes, i don't. A place like this really needs a lady of the house. I know it's early to be thinking of you as... Oh, God, i'm freaking you out, aren't I? It's just you make me feel so safe. I didn't...",Barney
"Hey, uh, can we get this in singles? Before we get the apartment i want to put in a kiddie pool and swim around in it naked. ",Marshall
Thank you.,Marshall
"What? Why? I mean, you already have Marshall's.",Lily

"My student loans. Great. I thought we were friends. you know what, it's fine to penalize me for trying to get an education and bud a career, but i will not let you deprive my beautiful wife of her dream home just because i...",Marshall
"Marshall, there's something i have to tell you, and i want you to hear it from me first.",Lilly
"Okay, let me get this straight. You just snuck this girl into some stranger's apartment?",Robin

"Hey, look at you.",Barney
I'm wearing your bathrobe. I hope you don't mind.,Girl
The only thing missing from that bathrobe are your initials.,Barney

Is that why my Yorkie trembled for like a week after i got back?,Robiin
Yeah. That little guy saw some stuff i'm not proud of.,Barney

"Whenever Marshall and Lily have a big argument, they always leave a trail of evidence all over the apartment.",Ted
"Oh, God here we go. He had a detective club as a kid.",Robin
HUm the Mosby boys cracked a lot of big cases.,Ted
The Mosby boys? You mean you and your sister.,Robin
We solved the mystery of the missing retainer.,Ted
"Let me guess, it was in the garbage.",Robin
"Why are you like this? Anyway, this is serious. I know Lily and Marshall. All the tell tale signs are here. Like this",Ted
A water bott.,Robin
It's not stiny water bottle. Notice the label is peed off.,Ted
"Just as i suspected, Cherry Garcia. Given the liquid consistency, i place the fight between... noon and 1.",Ted
"Ew, that was on the floor.",Robin
"If you wwant to get to the bottom of this, you're gonna need a stronger stomach than that, doll face.",Barney
"Marshall stood here. Eating and yelling, yelling and eating. Lily stood here. Crying. ",Ted
"Hey, Ted!",Robin
And then Marshall tried to storm out... but Lily went for the Hail Marpass.,Ted
"What do you think, make obsess?",Barney
"There'd be a bigger mess. tempted as he was, Marshall was still too upset.",Ted
Which Is why this picture is crooked.,Robin
"Nice catch, Robin.",Ted
"I'll just, uh, take this down to the lab. .",Barney
Now that we need is a motive. The million dollar question what were they fighting about?,Ted
I know what they've been fighting...,Robin
bup bup bup bup bup... Theres's only one possible conclusion. Lily and Marshall are fighting about peanut butter.,Ted
Ah!,Barney
Lily left the lid off...  and marshall blew heads.,Ted
"I know what they were fighting about, and it wasn't peanut butter.",Robin
"Robin, just...",Barney
"I appreciate your help, but there's a reason your name is Robin, not Batman.",Ted
They were fighting because they didn't get the loan and it's all Lily's fault.,Robin
"Robin, just...",Barney
What?,Ted
"Yeah, she has a pile of debt the size of mount... Rushmore",Robin
"Nice try Robin. So, the next thing Lily did was give Marshall a few hours to cool off about the peanut butter. Then she called him to apologize, which is why the last number dialed is... ",Ted
This can't be happening.,Ted
They can't... get divorced.,Barney
"Not Lily and Marshall, no way.",Ted
"Well, it's been nice knowing you guys.",Robin
What do you mean?,Ted
"Well, Marshall's gonna get yyou guys, Lily's gonna get me.",Robin
"Even if they break up, that doesn't mean we can't all hangout. I mean we broke up and we still hang out. It's not weird.",Ted
It's a little weird.,Robin
"Yeah, it is. It's weird.",Ted
"The world needs Marshall and Lily... together... I'm not crying, there's something in my eye.",Barney
They're back.,Robin
"Hey, hey guys.",Marshall
We have an annoucement.,Lily
I hit redial on the phone. Divorce lawyers?,Ted
"Ow, I should explain. We got in a pretty big fight.",Lily
"Yeah, I know",Ted
Marshall stormed out.,Lily
"I went, uh, to the bar.",Marshall
Still drinking that?,Lily
"I paid for it. And apparently money's tight now, so...",Marshall
"Listen, i've been thinking about this, and i know there's no way to undo what i've done, but, well, I made an appointment with a divorce lawyer.",Lily
What?! What?!,Marshall
"Oh no no! no, no, no",Lily
"No! I just mean on papers, so that you can buy the apartment without my bad credit dragging us down.",Lily
Lily... are you trying to k*ll me?,Marshall
"I'm sorry, i shouldn't have led with the divorce lawyer part.",Lily
"No, you shouldn't have! I love you, Lily.",Marshall
"I love you too, and i want us to have our dream home. And well, i don't know, it seems like this is a way to do it. So Marshall Eriksen, will you divorce me?",Lily
That's the sweetest divorce proposal i've ever heard.,Marshall
So is that a yes? You can't sleep with other women though.,Lily
"No we're not getting divorced, not even on paper. Lily, when i married you, i married your problems too. The ones i knew about and the ones i didn't. So that was the deal, we'll figure this out together. ",Marshall
So you're not getting a divorce?,Robin
No!,Lily
"Wow, guys! You scared us.",Ted
"Oh, thank God. Cause, i mean, if you did then who'd be the lame married couple i get to make fun of? Like 'Hey Marshall, you're married mrs right, you just didn't know her first name was Always.' That stuff is cold.",Barney
So what's the annoucement?,Robin
"I just got off the phone with the Realtor. We told her that, uh, because of our finances, we're not getting the place. It's just --it's not the right time.",Marshall

"Yes. This is our first Thanksgiving. 30 years from now, we're going to look at the photos and say, Oh, there's the four people I love most in the world... and Bob.",Lily
"I'm sorry,sometimes I forget how seriously you guys take American Thanksgiving. Real thanksgiving happened over a month ago.",Robin
"I'm sorry. Did you just say Canadian Thanksgiving was and I'm quoting,the real Thanksgiving? What do Canadians even have to celebrate about?",Barney

"Well, you know what? If you're trying to freak me out about spending Thanksgiving...",Barney
Slapsgiving.,Marshall
"...at your place, then you failed. Truth is, I'm not scared.",Barney
Really?,Marhall
"Right. Cause you blew it. The worst part about getting slapped is not knowing when it's going to happen. But now I know exactly when I'm gonna get slapped. So, you took all the suspense out. You showed your hand.",Barney
"And thursday at 3:01 p.m., your face is going to show my hand.",Marshall

Parents?,Ted
"They were totally on my case: What are you gonna do with your life? You're forty-one. and I'm like, Chillax, snowboarding is a legit career. you ought to be stoked I found my bliss. and speaking of bliss,sugar me, baby. ",Bob
Let's go get a drink.,Robin
Unbelievable. Robin is dating Orville Redenbacher.,Ted
What are you talking about? He's forty-one.he looks great.,Lily
"Yeah, du he's in pretty good shape. He could probably kick your ass.",Marshall
"How are you guys not seeing this? He's 150; Robin's 27. Barney, come on,what do you got?",Ted
Nothing but respect for that man.,Barney
"Oh, by the way, we're all baking pies at robin's tomorrow. Marshall can't be trusted in the apartment with pies overnight.",Lily
"For the millionth time, sleep-eating is a very serious and delicious medical condition.",Marshall
"Hey, uh, what time are you guys going to robin's?",Ted
7:30.,Lily
"Perfect. Just to be safe, I'll get there like 8:00, 8:30.",Ted
Sorry I'm late. Where are Marshall and Lily?,Ted
"Uh, they just called. They're both super swamped preparing for tomorrow.",Robin
Is Bob coming?,Ted
"No, he went to see green day.",Robin
So it's...,Ted
Making pies.,Robin
Pies. They're things that friends make together.,Ted
"Yeah, they do.",Robin
Great.,Ted
Yeah.,Robin
"Great. Well, this is great. It'll give us a chance to catch up.",Ted
Yeah.,Robin
I'm going to make a phone call. ,Ted
"Yeah, I'll be there, absolutely.",Barney
"Oh, awesome, you're a lifesaver. It's still kind of weird being alone with Robin, but if you were here...",Ted
"Hey, say no more. I mean, when I pulled you out of that burning wreckage, I wasn't doing it to have a battleship named after me. But if you insist, yes, I'll be there for the christening.",Barney
"You're hitting on someone right now, aren't you?",Ted
"No, I'm not going to wear the medal of honor. That would just be tacky.",Barney
So you're not coming to make pies.,Ted
"No, no. Thank you, mr. President. ",Barney
"Oh, marshall, are you working on the cranberry sauce?",Lily
"In a minute, baby. I've only got so many hands. You see what I got going on here? They're turkeys, but they're also hands, because later, we're going to eat turkey... and then i'm going to slap you in your face.",Marshall
"Please, you took out all the suspense. In a horror movie, the k*ll does not grab a bullhorn and announce, Attention unsupervised teens here at the lake house: at precisely 3:00 a.m., I'm gonna jump out of that closet right there and hack you all up with a machete. P.S. fire is my one weakness.",Barney
"Hey, ted.",Robin
"Hey, happy Thanksgiving.",Ted
"You, too. Is lily in the kitchen?",Robin
yep.,Ted
Great.,Robin
Marshall?,Ted
Lily?,Robin
What do you mean something weird happened last night?,Marshall
"You may not realize this, but since we broke up, Robin and I have never really been alone together.",Ted
"So we're in the kitchen, starting on the pies, and we realize, we don't have a damn thing to say to each other.",Ted
"I mean, you can't talk about how close you used to be. You can't talk about how close you're not now. You just feel like everything you say is gonna make things worse.",Ted
"Exactly. And you know why? Because you don't want to hurt someone you really care about, especially around the holidays. I mean, what decent human being would want to cause any kind of emotional or physical pain...",Barney
You're still getting slapped.,Marshall
"I wanted to leave, but i couldn't stick her with making all the pies by herself. She was exhausted.",Ted
I yawned like a million times trying to get him to leave.,Robin
"Yeah, some people just can't take a hint. By the way, I'm really swamped in here.",Lily
I kept looking at the clock and sighing... totally clueless.,Robin
"Uh-huh. I'm not sure I have time to mash those potatoes, you're standing right next to.",Lily
And then Ted does the thing that he always does when there's an awkward silence.,Robin
"Yep. masher's right there, next to the pot.",Lily
He panics and says the first thing that pops into his head.,Robin
"Hey, did you know that the first pies in recorded history came from Ancient Egypt?",Robin
"Remember last year's Thanksgiving, when we had sex seven times?",Ted
Ooh. terrible.,Barney
What?! I thought it would break the ice.,Ted
I'd already broken the ice with my cool pie fact. then he makes it ten times more awkward.,Robin
How do you respond to something like that?,Lily
Did you know that the egyptian pyramids can be seen from space? Probably?,Robin
"Ooh, the oven's pre-heated!",Ted
"Okay, um... the pecan pie is gonna take the longest. Why don't we put that one in first?",Robin
Pecan pie? Why are we making that?,Ted
"Um, it's my favorite.",Robin
You're allergic.,Ted
I know. I just like smelling it. It's like eating with your nose.,Robin
So we're making a pie for Bob.,Ted
Yeah.,Robin
She's got you making pies for this guy?,Barney
Yeah.,Ted
That is a real slap in the face.,Marshall
"You know, you could have just told me it was for Bob.",Ted
"Yeah, I-I just thought it might upset you.",Robin
Upset me? Wait a second. Do you think that......Do you think that I'm jealous of Bob?,Ted
I don't know. Is it so ridiculous to think that you might be?,Robin
Yes.,Ted
Why?,Robin
Because he's a thousand years old.,Ted
"No, Ted! What are you doing?",Lily
Right?,Robin
"The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that we can only talk about the first Thanksgiving,",Ted
Come on.,Robin
The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is because I heard noah gave him g*n in the ark.,Ted
Ted...,Robin
"The only reason I'm jealous of Bob is that I'm just an architect, but he discovered fire. How do you top that?",Ted
He's 41! Why are you bashing on him so hard?,Robin
I'm not. I'm just joking around. That's what friends do.,Ted
It's mean.,Robin
"Well, how come we're all allowed to bust on barney when he dates some skanktron, but when you sleep with the crypt keeper's dad, I'm not allowed to say a word?",Ted
"First of all, Bob and I are not sleeping together. We're just dating. Secondly, have I said one word about the parade of dubious conquests you've been marching past me the last few months? One of whom got you a butterfly tattoo?",Robin
"Hey, that is...",Ted
And if you and I are such good friends... why is baking a pie for Bob so weird?,Robin
"Yeah, if you and i are such good friends, why couldn't you just tell me that's what we were doing? Okay, maybe we should talk about this later. I-I should get going.",Ted
"Well, what are we doing? It's Thanksgiving.",Robin
I don't know. I'm sorry. This is stupid.,Ted
"I'm sorry, too. Of course we're friends. I'm glad we're friends.",Robin
"me, too.",Ted
That is a terrible idea!,Lily
Horrible idea.,Marshall
"Relapse five! That's where we high-five, then it's awkward for a little bit... and then we high-five again!",Barney
What the hell were you doing? Let's review: you and Ted broke up six months ago. You're dating another man...,Lily
"You are correct, Sir.",Robin
...who's coming to my thanksgiving today...,Lily
That is a truth-fact.,Robin
...an event Ted is also attending.,Lily
kablammo.,Robin
Why are you trying to destroy American Thanksgiving?!,Lily
"Oh, Lily, it's not as bad as it sounds. Bob and I aren't that serious, and what happened last night with Ted was a fluke.",Robin
"Well, did you guys at least talk about it?",Lily
: There's office material...,Ted
I hear something burning...,Robin
"Clearly, we need to ignore this.",Ted
"Clearly, we need to talk about this.",Robin
We need to talk.,Robin
Stuffed mushroom?,Ted
We need to talk about last night.,Robin
Did you know that some mushrooms are carnivorous? Probably... not?,Ted
"Ted, can we please just deal with this? Look, I'm not mad. I just think...",Robin
"Wait, wait, wait, wait. why would you be mad... you started it?",Ted
What?! you're crazy!,Robin
"We called a truce, we hugged, and when I tried to pull away, you kept your hand on my neck.",Ted
Only because your hand was still around my waist.,Robin
"Oh, come on! You leaned into it.",Ted
I... leaned into it?,Robin
"Yeah. You're like the crappy kid in little league who knows he's not going to make contact, so he just...Oops, I got hit by the pitch. Better take my base.",Ted
"Oh, that was you in little league, wasn't it?",Robin
My on-base percentage was off the charts!,Ted
"Oh, no! The slap-petizers.",Marshall
"You know what? That's it! This is Thanksgiving. Solve this right now. And if you have sex again, neither of you gets dessert! Oh, what the hell kind of Thanksgiving is this anyway?",Lily
"Um, most Thanksgivings.",Barney
"Don't stress, baby. I'll try to find us something relaxing.",Marshall
"Thanks, baby. Ooh, some classical music, maybe.",Lily
"Oh, my! Look at that. That means we're in the final hour of the countdown.",Marshall
I'm not scared.,Barney
"Then why is your right cheek twitching? It's not... maybe it's because future me slaps future you so hard, it reverberates back to the present, shattering the time-slap continuum.",Marshall
Please don't slap me.,Barney
"I'm sorry, what?",Marshall
"Oh, God! don't slap me again! I don't want to get slapped again, and the first two times hurt so bad, I don't like it! I don't like it one bit!",Barney
"I thought I ruined it by putting a clock on it, Barney?",Marshall
"Well, you didn't ruin it; you made it so much worse! I can't eat. I can't sleep. I've lost ten pounds; my suits are wearing me. You know what? I'm outta here.",Barney
"Well, no, no, no. you can't leave.",Marshall
"Why can't I?! Nowhere in the rules does it say that I have to sit through sort of mental torture! You are allowed to slap my face, Sir, but you are not allowed to slap my mind! Good day!",Barney
But it's Slapsgiving.,Marshall
"No! It's not! It's Thanksgiving! Our first one as a married couple, as grownups and you're not even trying to be a part of it! None of you are! So... as slap bet commissioner, I'm issuing a ruling. Thanksgiving is a day of peace. There will be no slaps today!",Lily
What?!,Marshall
Yes! In your face! Not my face... your face!,Barney
"What's up, dudes?",Bob
"Hey, bob.",All
"Baby,please... -no!",Marshall
"The slap bet commissioner's word is final, so get in the kitchen and mash some potatoes, now. And for the rest of the day, we are going to enjoy a civilized, grownup holiday.",Lily
"Not too grownup. I made jell-o shots. We're gonna get silly, bitches.",Bob
"Look at us! We can't be alone together, can we?",Robin
Apparently not.,Ted
What does that mean? We're supposed to be friends.,Robin
"We aren't friends, are we? Not really. We avoid each other. We smile politely. We're two people who pretend to be friends because it would be inconvenient not to.",Ted
"Well, maybe we should stop pretending.",Robin
Maybe we should.,Ted
So... what do we do now?,Robin
I suppose... we eat dinner. And then that's it.,Ted
Okay.,Robin
Happy Thanksgiving.,Ted
"Marshall, you're not eating. Did something spoil your slap-petite?",Barney
"No, i just thought...before we eat, maybe the chef would like to say a few words.",Marshall
Nope. This sucks. Eat up and leave.,Lily
"Well, then, I'd like to say something. If that's cool? Um... today, Lily did something great. Not only did she gather us all here together and cook a delicious meal, but she also started a new tradition. We're gonna do this again next year, and the year after that... maybe for the rest of our lives. I think that's pretty amazing if you think about it. And it's all thanks to you,Lily. I love you. So, to the first of many Thanksgivings together.",Marshall
"This is rad! A nice, small,simple Thanksgiving. I'm the youngest of ten in my family, so our Thanksgiving is a mess. All the yelling and the screaming...",Bob
It's really a major k*ll.,Bob
"Oh, no...",Lily
I thought we were done with that?,Barney
I guess we're not.,Robin
Guess we're not.,Ted
"Hey, check it out! We're in the last 20 seconds of Marshall's countdown to nothing.",Barney
"Barney, put it away.",Lily
"How does it feel, Marshall,to sit there, impotently... your large, flaccid hand,just dangling in the wind?",Barney
The slap will occur in ten..,Voice
"Ooh, classy touch, dude. Too bad!",Barney
"Barney, put it away.",Lily
...six...,Voice
I will in... five...,Barney
"... five, four...",Voice
You can slap him.,Lily
...three...,Voice
"What?! Wait, you...",Barney
...two...one.,Voice
"That's three! Thanks, baby, you're the best. And as a special, added bonus, I've composed a song just for this occasion. Ted, lights!  ",Marshall
"Well, guys have fun.",Lily
This is gonna be majoy cleaner.,Ted
Major cleaner!,All
"Oh man, we're gonna be doing this all the time, now aren't we?",Marshall
That's the general idea.,Robin
General idea.,All
"oh, that's not a tattoo. That, dear boy, is a tramp stamp!",Barney
a tramp stamp?!,Ted
"kids, too often in life, we make decisions that we're not prepared to live with.  This is a story about those decisions, and the consequences that follow. ",Narrator
"Say goodbye, kids, 'cause it won't be around much longer. ",Ted
"oh, but Ted, if you get rid of the butterfly, how's everyone gonna know you're a stripper fron reno with daddy issues?",Lily
"yes, yes, enjoy these final moments of mockery because in just ten surprisingly expensive sessions, Stella is gonna zap that butterfly right off the face of my lower back.",Ted
Stella?,Lily
Dr Stella Zinman. She's the best in the business. And she's rather cute in fact. In fact... we're going to a movie together tonight.,Ted
what?,Barney
I asked her out.,Ted
"Ted, why would you do that?",All
what's matter with you?,Barney
What? What do you mean?,Ted
Dude... don't poop where you eat.,Barney
"oh, no, this doesn't count.",Ted
"If it's someone you see on a regular basis, and you can't avoid them...",Marshall
"and in this case, you're paying them... then yes, it counts.",Lily
"You've heard of the golden rule, right? love their neighbor?",Barney
"uh, actually, it's do unto others as you would have them do unto you. It's from the bible.",Ted
"Damn it Ted, i've worked out this whole thing where the golden rule is love thy neighbor, ok?... Now the golden rule is love thy neigbor. But, there's one rule above it: the platinum rule: never ever, ever, ever, love thy neighbor.",Barney
"Well, that's cute. But she's not my neighbor, she's my doctor. So if you'll excuse me...",Ted
"Wait, Ted, Barney has a point. Remember what happened with me and curt down at the station?",Robin
"Oh, yeah, and remember what happened with us and the gerards across the hall?",Marshall
Need i remind you about me and Wendy the waitress?,Barney
"good, then we've got a solid half hour. And in that time, we will convince you not to set foot out that door. It's a story older than time, my friend, and it always plays out in the same eight steps. Step 1: Attraction.",Barney
It's true.,Barney
That's not even possible.,Marshall
12 of them.,Barney
There's no way.,Marshall
Here's your gin and tonic.,Wendy
Thanks.,Barney
O gosh! Look at that. ,Wendy
"Oh, hi, welcome to the building. Yeah.",Marshall
Do you guys know any good brunch places around here?,Laura
We love brunch!,Lily
yeah!,Robin
"Oh, welcome. You look really familiar. Are you a former athlete?",Robin
Hockey.,Curt
"But you know better. You've seen your friends make the same mistakes before. You've laughed smugly at them. Idiots! But still, you think, this is different. The platinum rule doesn't apply to me. And that step 2! Bargaining.",Barney
I think i've got a little crush on our sports guy.,Robin
"NO! no, no, don't do it!",All
"I know, i know but he used to play hockey, and i'm canadian. I can't help it. If he were missing some teeth, i probably would have already hit that.",Robin
"Robin, it's a mistake. Remember what happened with me and Marshall? The Gerards across the hall?",Lily
Michael and LAura. They're awesome. We're gonna invite them over for dinner.,Lily
"This is NYC.You don't get close to the neighbors. You nod at them politely in the hall. You call the cops if you haven't seen them in a while and you smell something funny, and that is it.",Ted
we're not gonna date them. We're just gonna be friends with them.,Lily
That's the couples version of dating.,Barney
"And you've got the couples version of the hots for them. Oh, yeah, you want to browse at pottery barn with them. You want to go antiquing with them, don't you? Oh, yeah, you want to antique the crap out of them.",Robin
Need i remind you what happened with me and Wendy the waitress?,Barney
I've decided to seduce Wendy the waitress.,Barney
Request denied! What rule is there that say's i can't seduce the waitress at my favorite bar?,Barney
I don't know. I'd expect you to have one already.,Lily
"Yeah, with some sort of catchy name.",Robin
"Well, i don't. I don't have one and i never will be because it's a great idea. Come on, guys! She's gullible. I'm bored. We're perfect for each other.",Barney
"Barney, we love this bar. If you screxw over Wendy the waitress, you're going to k*ll the bar.",Ted
Bar k*ll.,Robin
"Don't k*ll the bar, dude.",Marshall
"yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.",Barney
"yeah, well, i think it'll be okay.",Marshall
"yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.",Robin
And it was a huge mistake.,Robin
"yeah, well... I think it'll be okay.",Ted
"Ted, trust me. You don't want to do this.",Barney
"Look, Stella and i are adults; we're both smart, mature people capable of making good decisions.",Ted
You have a butterfly tramp stamp.,Robin
"We're just seeing a movie. If it seems at all weird, i'll back off.",Ted
That's what everyone thinks and then along comes step 3: Submission.,Barney
Good night!,Barney
Hey Barney! Carl had to take off. You mind giving me a hand?,Wendy
Not at all.,Barney
Robin! I got 2 tickets to the rangers. Center ice. Want to go?,Curt
and then we discover the movers lost all our kitchen boxes. We don't have a single pot or pan.,Laura
Guess we're ordering take-out.,Michael
Want to have dinner with us tonight?,Lily
That was an intersting use of the beverage g*n.,Wendy
Club soda can get anything off.,Barney
"It finally happened, all this time, every drink i brought you... I always felt there was this unspoken connection between us. And i was right!",Wendy
"hey, can i get a gin and tonic?",Barney
"See, i bet you didn't pay for that gin and tonic.",Ted
"oh, i paid for it.",Barney
"But you got to admit, there is an upside to breaking the platinum rule. Like maybe as her boyfrien, i could get a discount on treatments.",Ted
"Oh, Ted, of course there's an upside. At first, that's step 4: Perks.",Barney
"we can split a cab to work together. We always have a standing lunch date. And last night, at the hockey game, Curt got us into the locker room, and i met Mason Raymond. Left wing for the Vancouver canucks.",Robin
What the opposite of name-dropping?,Barney
"Damn it you guys, be psyched. Yes, we see each other every day, but i think it's going really well.",Robin
That's what we thought.,Lily
And it's so conveniant. They're right across the hall. Say it's sunday and we want to have a brunch double date with someone.,Lily
We just go across the hall.,Marshall
And say we want to have a dinner party exploring the wine and cuisine of France's Loire Valley.,Lily
We just go across the hall.,Marshall
Say we want to play a game of charades...,Lily
"Come on people, get excited for us! We've got a great thing going here.",Lily
That's what i thought.,Barney
"Dude, you got to flick it.",Marshall
you don't have... ,Barney
"Hi, sweetie. I had the kitchen whip these up, no charge.  Okay. Bye. I mean, not bye. I'm not leaving. I'll be over there. okay. ",Wendy
"Come on, guys, free nachos. What?",Barney
We like this bar.,Ted
"Don't k*ll the bar, dude.",Marshall
"Barney, we love this bar.",Ted
"Don't k*ll the bar, dude.",Marshall
This bar is like home to us.,Ted
You're k*ll the bar.,Lily
I'm not k*ll the bar. Wendy the waitress has seen how i operate in this place. It is perfectly clear to everyone involved that this is nothing more than a temporary fling.  It's fiiine.,Barney
It's fine.,Marshall
It's fine.,Robin
But it wasn't.,Robin
Which brings us to step 5: THE TIPPING POINT.,Barney
"...but he should be back on the mound by spring training and that's sport. Back to you, Robin.",Curt
Thanks iron man we'll be right back.,Robin
and clear.,Productor
So you want to do something later?,Robin
"Oh, so you're talking to me now?",Curt
What are you talking about?,Robin
"I'm talking about last night. You said you'd call and you didn't. I missed you and i waited up, but you didn't call. That really hurts.",Curt
"oh, um, i'm sorry, i-i guess i just forgot.",Robin
I'm sorry Sweetie. I don't want to fight tonight. It's our first weekiversary. ,Curt
"on my suggestion, you... ",Marshall
"hey, Wendy, uh, do me a favor and send a glass of champagne to that pretty young girl over there.",Barney
What? ,Wendy
over there... YOU... you're the pretty young thing...is what i meant. Champagne? Would you? on me.,Barney
"Oh, okay, thanks sweetie. ",Wendy
okay. All right.,Barney
"hey, neighbors.",Michael
We bought all the fixings for a mexican fiesta.,Laura
"um, well, we actually have tickets...",Lily
and no fiesta would be complete without,Michael
"Dude, actually, we made other plans, so... okay  one word. 2 syllables. Sounds like... parades: charades.",Marshall
charades!,Michael
What do you say?,Laura
Oh no!,All
which brings to step 6.,Barney
"Yeah, listen i'm leaving so if you want to write the rest of these down, i will read it tomorrow.",Ted
Don't do this Ted.,Barney
You want to get out of the way?,Ted
Don't do this Ted. Don't ,Ted
Dude! ya! It was perfect! You're such a jerk!,Ted
Which brings us to step 6. You finally realize you've made a huge mistake and now you have to live with it. Step 6 is called purg... wait for it. Keep waiting. Keep waiting for the eternity only to dicover there's no escap-atory.,Barney
"God, i'm such an idiot.",Robin
yeah.,Marshall
"Curt the iron man irons keeps leaving me love notes on post-its. On the teleprompter, on my desk, on the coffee-maker, on the jar of sugar packets next to the coffee-maker.",Robin
The iron man. oh!,Robin
I remember that.,Marshall
Ro! we are such idiots!,Marshall
Yeah!,Barney
"Every time we step out the door, they're out there waiting for us. Sometimes, we'll send Ted out first as a scout. Nobody's there. Then we'll go out one second later, and there they are.",Lily
It's freakin' supernatural. Are they ghosts? Can only we see them?,Marshall
"Hey neighbor! Hey, neighborHey neighbor.",Lily
I remember that.,Barney
How could you guys let me date Wendy the waitress?,Barney
oh you are kidding me?! What?!,All
Don't k*ll the bar dude!,Marshall
tss ,Barney
"You've got a whole meat locker at home full of corpses, don't you?",Ted
"Now look at me. Declawed. Neutered. What was once my jungle is now my zoo and i am forced to mate with the same old lioness again, and again, and again while families pay to watch.",Barney
"yeah, this metaphor's really falling apart.",Ted
"Put a bell around my neck and scratch my belly kids, for i am just a docile housecat now. Miaou!",Barney
"Well, we love this bar. You can't dump her. Marry her if you have to.",Lily
Wendy the waitress hyphen Stinson.,Robin
don't k*ll the bar dude.,Marshall
"And so, inevitably, you have to do the thing you've been dreading all along. Now, a relationship-ectomy is a delicate surgery as it is, but in the case of the platinum rule, it takes a very, very steady hand, and that's step 7: CONFRONTATION.",Barney
"Curt, we need to talk. I like you...",Robin
"guys, we like you a lot...",Marshall
I don't like you.,Barney
"We're pretending this works, but it doesn't. And i'm getting a little sick of the whole charade.",Robin
We're getting a little sick of charades.,Lily
"I mean, i don't like you that way. I used to like you that way but now that i've seen everything there is to see, i don't know, i kind of want to see those same parts just on other girls.",Barney
So maybe we could go back to just being coworkers.,Robin
Maybe we should just go back to being neighbors.,Marshall
"other girls and you, if you're into that but the other girls have to be there, too. That's the important part.",Barney
"Gosh, you're just terrified of ever getting close to anyone, aren't you?",Wendy
or that. Let's say it's that. So can i get a gin and tonic?,Barney
"And in any other relationship, that would be it. End of story. But because you have to see this person again, there's a step 8: FALLOUT.",Barney
"And now, here's Curt the iron man irons with sports. Curt?  Curt?",Robin
"Well, the Knicks lost. It's sad, really. They had a real sh*t. Then, out of nowhere, game over. And why? Why Robin?",Curt
"Uh, well, their perimeter sh**ting has been a little bit off this season...",Robin
"The knicks lost because they were afraid of getting hurt. So they didn't even try. Well, you know what i think? I think the knicks didn't deserve my love to begin with. Kincks suck! ",Curt
And that's sports.,Robin
Do you see anything?,Lily
I think we're clear.,Marshall
ok go go go. ,Lily
That was close.,Marshall
Too close.  You've got to be kidding me. What do we do?,Lily
I have no idea. ,Marshall
"guys, are you here? I forgot my keys. Can you open up?",Ted
It's just Ted!,Lily
Wait! ,Marshall
Hello? Guys? ,Ted
"Baby, we only have one choice.",Marshall
"Okay, hurry!  Michael and Laura are probably...",Lily
"Hey, neighbors.",Laura
"Barney, i just want you to know, i have no hard feelings. It wasn't the best idea for us to get involved. I hope we can still be friends.",Wendy
Thanks Wendy. Of course we can.,Barney
"If you need anything else, let me know.",Wendy
waouh. I've got to hand it to Wendy the waitress that was very mature of her.,Ted
She's gonna try to k*ll me. This is poisoned.,Barney
What? You're being ridiculous.,Ted
Yours is poisoned too. She's trying to k*ll me and everyone close to me.,Barney
What are you talking about?,Ted
Ted! Look at the facts. I dump her and she says no hard feelings. She's a psycho! What other explanation is there?,Barney
"Uh, that you're letting yourself believe she's crazy so you don't have to face the far more likely possibility that she doesn't want to date you either?",Ted
Where did Marshall get that hamburger?,Barney
"I don't know, i guess Wendy the Waitress brought it to him.",Ted
Dude.,Marshall
You're welcome.,Barney
"Wait a second. You've been sitting here, pretending to be the expert on all this, but the truth is, this was no real fallout from your breakup at all?",Robin
Yet.,Barney
You're an idiot.,Robin
"All right, i'm taking off.",Ted
What?,Barney
I have a date. ,Ted
You're such a jerk!,Ted
"Ted, have you not been listening? Attraction, bargaining, submission, perks, tipping point, purgatory, confrontation, fallout! These things will all happen to you as surely as they happened to all of us! It's a rule of nature.",Barney
"Well, i'm sick of all the rules! There's too many of them! The hot/crazy scale, the lemon law, the platinum rule! If everyone in the world followed every one of your rules, the human race would cease to exist. Yes chances are to Stella and I are not going to live happily ever after the overwhelming odds have it ending badly. And when that happens, it'll be for one of a million possible reasons. But that doesn't mean i'm not gonna try. And when it does fail, so help me god, it's not gonna be because of some rule.  PS: you just made my hair look awesome. Good night. ",Ted
"So Stella and i went on our date. But here's the funny thing: turns out, it wasn't actually a date.",Narrator
So what do you mean it wasn't a date?,Marshall
She thought we were seeing a movie just as friends.,Ted
Why would she think that?,Marshall
Did she see your tattoo and assume you were gay?,Robin
"Apparently, there's a rule that says i can't date Stella.",Ted
"Exactly, the platinum rule. Stella reads my blog.",Barney
"No, this rule comes from the american medical association. Doctors aren't legally allowed to date their patients.",Ted
"Oh, sorry Ted.",Lily
It's okay. What are you guys watching?,Ted
"So that was the end of the story between me and Stella, at least for the time being. But i don't know, looking back on the platinum rule, i think there's a ninth step. We'll call it coexistence. It's the moment you realize that all that anger and resentment just isn't useful.",Narrator
Thanks for watching.,Robin
Good night.,Curt
and you start to let go of it.,Narrator
So what do you guys have going on tonight?,Lily
We're going to have a few friends over.,Laura
gonna play some charades.,Michael
Have fun.,Marshall
And move on with your life.,Narrator
It just takes a while.,Narrator
Thanks.  Crazy!,Barney
"Ah, the butterfly tramp stamp. My bread and butter. So I'm guessing that the real story involves a bad breakup and some booze. Unless it's a gang tattoo, in which case, I think it's time to find a new gang.",Stella
"No, I just thought it would be cool to get a caterpillar tattoo, and then a few weeks went by, and all of a sudden...",Ted
"Well, I can get rid of it in ten one-hour sessions, but, I should warn you, laser surgery's very painful.",Stella
"Well, I think you'll find I have a very high tolerance for pain. Just last night, I sat through the worst movie ever made.",Ted
"Oh, Plan 9 From Outer Space?",Stella
"No, the worst movie... Manos: Hands of Fate.",Ted
"Uh, I'm a doctor, went to medical school. It's Plan 9. If you don't believe me, it's playing down at the Pamela Theater.",Stella
"Uh-huh. I don't believe you, Doctor.",Ted
"Well, what are you doing tonight?",Stella
"Hey, Ted.",Stella
"Hey. Hey, put that away. Tonight's on me.",Ted
"Oh, no, no, don't...",Stella
"Come on, I insist.",Ted
"That's so nice. Thank you. Hey, guys, this is my friend Ted. ",Stella
"Oh, wow. Oh, yay. Wow, thank you. One, two, three, four.",Ted
"No, it's just, um... I'm just a little embarrassed. I thought this was a date. But it's no big deal. Don't worry about it.",Ted
"Yeah, I got it.",Ted
We all got it. Ted's a schmuck.,Man
And you bought all the tickets.,Stella
"Yeah, yeah. Hey, you were right. Worst movie-going experience ever. Of course, it had nothing to do with the movie.",Ted
I am so sorry that you thought that was a date.,Stella
"No, it's fine. I got to hang out with you on girls' night out. All right, so if you're not allowed to date a patient, I'll just... I'll wait until these ten session are up and then I'll ask you out then.",Ted
"Well, then,fair warning: I'm going to say no.",Stella
"Really? I'm getting mixed signals from you. I feel like you've been staring at my ass for quite some time. What, you're married?",Ted
No.,Stella
Boyfriend?,Ted
No.,Stella
Lesbian?,Ted
No.,Stella
Only date black guys?,Ted
No.,Stella
"And yet you can say with absolute confidence that ten weeks from now, if I ask you out on a date, your answer will be...",Ted
No.,Stella
"No... Hmm. What could she mean when she says 'no'? I don't know, it is totally cryptic.",Robin
This is far from over. We're talking ten weeks from now. Who knows what she'll want then? Do you know what you're going to want for lunch ten weeks from now?,Ted
"Sloppy Joe, shrimp cocktail and a milk shake.",Marshall
"Ted, do you know how long it takes a woman to decide whether or not she's going to sleep with a guy? 8.3 seconds. After that, her decision is made. She will not change her mind.",Barney
That's ridiculous.,Ted
Is it? Describe your first 8.3 seconds with Stella.,Barney
Lower back butterfly tattoo... you're up.,Stella
"So we got off to a rocky start. That may be a problem for some guys, but I get better over time. Right? I'm not some Top 40 song... easily digestible. I'm complex. I require time and multiple listens. I'm 'Stairway to Heaven'.",Ted
"Wow, Roger Daltrey just rolled over in his grave. That's not the right guy, is it? He's not even dead, is he?",Robin
"I think that's great, Ted. You can do whatever you set your mind to. In fact, you've inspired me. I'm going to stop biting my nails.",Lily
"But, baby, you love biting your nails.",Marshall
"I know, but I'm doing this for Ted. Hmm. God, this is really hard.",Lily
"Give me ten sessions, I'm going to turn that no into a yes.",Ted
"Really, Ted? You think so? Well, tell me, how did the rest of that session go?",Barney
This is going to hurt a little.,Stella
"Yeah, well, I can handle pain. This one time I was playing tennis, and... ",Ted
"Yeah, but tattoo removal really hurts. Everyone probably sounds like that.",Stella
"Doctor, are you all right? I heard a woman screaming in here. Oh. (",Abby
Here's to nine more great sessions.,Ted
Still no.,Stella
"Still no. What's up with that? I mean, I juggled.",Ted
You juggled? I thought you were trying to impress her.,Barney
You do magic. How is juggling any lamer than magic?,Ted
Magic's not lame.,Barney
I don't get it. I mean...,Ted
Is this lame?,Barney
"Oh, Barney, no, no. We said no fireballs at the table.",Robin
What the hell is wrong with you?,Marshall
There's alcohol in here.,Robin
Barney...,Lily
I...,Barney
We've talked about this. It's a fire code violation.,Lily
"Yeah, but Ted provoked me.",Barney
"No, no, you are on a time-out. Go sit over there.",Lily
But...,Barney
Go!,Lily
Anyway... I don't get it. She should be into me by now.,Ted
"You know, you can do this, Ted. I said that I would stop biting my nails, and kablam-ey. It's just a challenge. It can't be easy to woo someone while you're sticking your naked butt in their face.",Lily
Works for baboons. It's called presenting.,Marshall
I got four sessions left. Ther-There's got to be an angle I'm not seeing.,Ted
"You can't turn a no into a yes, Ted. Can't be done.",Barney
"I don't know, Barney. I mean, sometimes persistence pays off. I said yes eventually.",Robin
"No, you didn't. You were like, No, we can't, we're friends. It would mess up the dynamic of the group.",Barney
To Ted.,Robin
"Oh, right.",Barney
"Wait a second. Wait a second, I got the angle.",Ted
"Sir, please don't yell at me, because when people yell at me, I have a tendency to start crying. Please don't do it.",Abby
"Abby, I've told you before.",Stella
...Please...,Abby
"When they're rude to you, hang up the phone.",Stella
...how difficult it is for me to...,Abby
"Go on, you can do this, hang up. Abby, hang it up.",Stella
I am too busy to waste my time... ,Abby
"I'm sorry, I just wish that some of the patients would be nicer to you.",Stella
The receptionist. That's my way in.,Ted
I like this. Seduce the receptionist. That's a great plan.,Barney
That's not the plan. And how would that help me with Stella?,Ted
Who?,Barney
Here's the plan.,Ted
Hi. Here. I stopped... ,Ted
"Oh, wow, thank you, that's so nice. You're like a knight. I should call you Sir Ted.",Abby
What?,Ted
Nothing. Nothing. ,Abby
"Thanks. Thanks, Abby.",Stella
And now... we wait.,Ted
"Okay, I'm about to break my big rule here.",Stella
Break it.,Ted
"Okay. Abby goes bowling with her church group every Wednesday nights...and she really wanted to invite you, but she's too shy.",Stella
Abby is...?,Ted
"My receptionist. You really made quite an impression on her with the coffee the other day. I mean, she has really not stopped talking about you.",Stella
"Oh, Abby. I thought you said Alan.",Ted
"But you just said, Abby is...?",Stella
"Right. Right, I thought I said Alan.",Ted
Who's Alan?,Stella
Who's Abby?,Ted
My receptionist.,Stella
Exactly.,Ted
What is happening?,Ted
"Ted. You just got to be yourself, no more gimmicks.",Lily
"You're right, no more gimmicks. One more gimmick.",Ted
You know what's on her shelf? That self-help book 'The Power of Me'.,Ted
"I know, I know, but I thought if I read it, maybe we'd have something new to talk about.",Ted
It's actually a great book. It taught me the power of complete memory.,Marshall
Can I borrow your copy?,Ted
I left it somewhere... I forget.,Marshall
Hi. Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.,Ted
"Hi, Ted. I'll let her know.",Abby
Telepathically?,Ted
"I am so sorry that I am late. I have, like, two minutes for lunch everyday.",Stella
"It's crazy. Yeah, I understand. I was just, uh, checking out the old bookshelf here. I see you've read 'The Power of Me'. It's funny...",Ted
"What? Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, I would never read that piece of crap. Some patient left it here.",Stella
"Oh, thank God. ",Ted
"Ted, I found your book.",Abby
What?,Ted
Your book 'The Power of Me'. I think you accidentally dropped it in the garbage.,Abby
"What? No, that's... that's not mine. I've never seen that before in my life.",Ted
"No, you were reading it in the lobby.",Abby
"Wha... no, you have me confused with someone else.",Ted
"No, no, look right here. From the personal library of Ted Mosby. That's you.",Abby
"Ted, I hate to say this, but I think it's nail the receptionist time.",Robin
I'm not gonna nail the receptionist.,Ted
"Ted, every little boy wants to grow up to nail the doctor or the lawyer. Somebody's gotta nail the receptionist.",Barney
No. I like Stella.,Ted
"Okay, I'm gonna stop you right there, Ted. Your little Stella is not so perfect.",Barney
What do you mean?,Ted
"I went down there and checked her out for myself. Yeah. And while I was down there, I discovered that she had a secret, a terrible... terrible secret.",Barney
What? What is it?,Ted
"Hold on, I gotta pee. ",Barney
What's the big secret?!,Ted
"Oh. Oh, right.",Barney
"Hi, I'd like to see Dr. Zinman, please.",Barney
"Sure, what's it regarding?",Abby
"Oh, I just want to see her. Want to look at her, see what she looks like.",Barney
I-I don't understand.,Abby
"I'm sorry, did I accidentally oprima numero dos when I called? Do you speak English? I want to see her!",Barney
"Sir, please don't yell at me because when people yell at me, I have a tendency to start crying.",Abby
What are your credentials?!,Barney
Please don't do that. Please.,Abby
I want to know who am I speaking with!,Barney
"At first she seemed great, beautiful, smart, way out of your league. But then, I overheard this conversation.",Barney
"Oh, Abby, did my hypnotherapist call yet?",Stella
No.,Abby
When am I going to kick this folliculaphilia?,Stella
Folliculaphilia?,Ted
Folliculaphilia.,Barney
What is that?,Ted
"Ted, your perfect woman can only be attracted to men with moustaches.",Barney
That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. That's not real.,Ted
"You're right, Ted. I'm just making that up.",Barney
I know that you are because there's no such thing.,Ted
I got it a little bit.,Robin
"Hi. Uh, Ted Mosby for Dr. Zinman.",Ted
"Oh, hi, Ted. Love the 'stache. You look like a young Tom Selleck, only a million times handsomer. Dr. Zinman, Magnum's here to see you. Just kidding. Stupid.",Abby
Sorry I'm late. Typical two-minute lunch. So we are very close to getting...,Stella
Why? Just why?,Ted
Y-you don't remember?,Barney
I'll bet anyone ten bucks I can get Ted to grow a moustache.,Barney
Uh... okay.,Ted
You sabotaged my next to last chance with Stella for ten dollars?,Ted
"I know. I would've done it for free. But, no. You owe me ten bucks.",Barney
"This is awful. My-my tenth session is next week. I'm gonna ask her out, and she's gonna say the most demoralizing syllable in the English language... no. You know what? Just forget it. I'm not even gonna ask her.",Ted
"No, you have to. She likes you. She said so herself. (",Lily
"Oh, my God, you went and saw her, too.",Ted
"I swear to you, I did not.",Lily
My wife's always getting on me about my dry elbows. So good to be in a relationship. Anyone special in your life? Or maybe just someone you're interested in? Interes-ted in?,Marshall
"You know, we should really get this mole checked out. It's just a little irregular.",Stella
"Irregular? Oh, my God. This is it. It's all over.",Marshall
One of my patients has this little butterfly tattoo at the bottom of his back.,Stella
"Can you stop talking about your other patients?! I'm dying here, woman!",Marshall
"There you go. Look, even if it is something, it's easily treatable, so try to relax.",Stella
"Okay. Hey, what was it you were saying before about the guy with the butterfly tattoo?",Marshall
"Oh, that... that's nothing. It's just a little crush. So I will be calling you with your results.",Stella
Oh. Okay. Thank you.,Marshall
"Oh, sir, your book!",Stella
No.,Ted
Yes.,Marshall
She said crush? And she was talking about me?,Ted
All done.,Stella
"Stella...now that I'm no longer your patient, would you like to have dinner with me?",Ted
"Ted, you're a really nice guy...",Stella
"Oh, no.",Ted
It has been so great getting to know you.,Stella
I am gonna k*ll Marshall.,Ted
I've had so much fun these last ten weeks.,Stella
"Oh, my God, this is worse than the laser.",Ted
I have a daughter.,Stella
What?,Ted
"Her name's Lucy. She's eight. Work and being with her, that's pretty much my life. My social calendar is movie night with the girls once a month when I can get a sitter. I mean, I've been to one party in the past year... St. Paddy's Day... it was awful, I left early. But, really, my only free time is the two minutes I get for lunch, so... this is why I don't date. Ted, I only have time for one most important person in my life, and that's Lucy. Anyway, it's been fun. Next time, think before you ink. But if you ever do wake up with, like, a dolphin tattoo on your ankle, just give me a call.",Stella
There it is... she's a mom. It's just not gonna happen.,Ted
"Sorry, dude. Have a shrimp.",Marshall
I'm good. I guess I got no one but myself to blame. She told me right from the start she was gonna say no and sure enough... Wait a minute.,Ted
You didn't actually say no.,Ted
What do you mean?,Stella
"All this time you were, uh, you were supposed to say no, but you didn't... I checked the transcript. So, here's what I'm proposing. Uh... You only have two minutes, right?",Ted
Right.,Stella
"Okay. You want to, uh... go on a a two-minute date with me?",Ted
Last two-minute date I had gave me a daughter. Um... Okay.,Stella
Great. And... go. Taxi!,Ted
Hello!,Ranjit
"Ted, I seriously only have two minutes...",Stella
I know.,Ted
That's like 120 seconds.,Stella
"380 West 22nd, please. And step on it. We're in a hurry.",Ted
380 West 22nd? That's...,Stella
Right this way.,Ted
House salad.,Waitress
"So, college?",Ted
Stanford.,Stella
Uh-huh. Wesleyan.,Ted
"Oh, good. Do you know Adam Lazar?",Stella
No. Scott Crable?,Ted
Eggplant parmesean.,Waitress
Thanks.,Ted
"Oh, already cut up. Nice.",Stella
Could we get the check please. We're trying to make a movie in 15 seconds.,Ted
Of course.,Waitress
"Okay, great. Uh, how do you want to do this? You had the eggplant parm. I only really had water so... I'm kidding. Oh. Okay. Let's go. Taxi! You nervous?",Ted
A little bit.,Stella
You can't tell at all.,Ted
"Oh, good. Yeah.",Stella
Hello!,Ranjit
384 West 22nd.,Ted
15 seconds. The movie's started.,Stella
"Nah, previews. We'll be fine. Ah! Just in time. It hasn't started yet.",Ted
"So, what are we seeing?",Stella
Manos: Hands of Fate.,Ted
The whole thing?,Stella
Only the important parts. Worst movie ever.,Ted
"Yeah, I almost walked out, like, five times.",Stella
How we doing on time? Taxi!,Ted
We got a little time.,Stella
Okay. Do you want to walk it?,Ted
Why not?,Stella
Hello! Good-bye!,Ranjit
So what grade's your daughter in?,Ted
Third grade.,Stella
Ah! That's a good year.,Ted
"Yeah, she's wonderful. I just wish that I could get her to quit smoking, you know?",Stella
What?,Ted
I'm kidding.,Stella
"Oh. Look, coffee and dessert?",Ted
"You know, this neighborhood just keeps on changing. This used to be a cute, little Italian restaurant.",Stella
"I know. New York. It's a living organism, an ever-changing tapestry. Ooh, look at the time. Let's go.",Ted
"Mmm, the cheesecake's amazing.",Stella
Flowers?,Ted
I'm allergic.,Stella
"Okay. See? We're getting to know each other. Stella, I had a lovely... Doggy bag? Stella, I had a lovely time.",Ted
"Me, too, Ted.",Stella
And... date.,Ted
Huh?,Stella
"That wasn't so bad, right? No lengthy, awkward silences. Dessert ran a little long, so... I had to cut the good-night kiss.",Ted
I think I can be late just once. ,Stella
"Look, I would love to have a second date, I would. But I understand that you really don't have time right now, but if you ever do, will you give me a call?",Ted
Yes.,Stella
Okay.,Ted
"All my friends told me, Abby, be strong. He doesn't deserve another chance. But I forgive you! (",Abby
"No, no, no, no!",Ted
...then he just kept toying with my emotions.,Abby
Wow. This Ted guy sounds like a real jerk. You know your problem? You're too sweet.,Barney
Aren't you going to see the doctor about that mole?,Abby
"Oh, yeah. Turns out it's just a Raisinet. Hey, how would you like me to take you out to a fancy restaurant and then go on a shopping spree? Treat you the way you should be treated. Would that make you forget about that Ted monster?",Barney
My mom was wrong. There are nice guys in New York.,Abby
We just have to go by my hotel room first. My bed was broken. I just have to make sure they fixed it.,Barney
"Well, then if it's fixed, can we can have sex on it and then go shopping.",Abby
I like you.,Barney
Hey.What's with the blackboard?,Robin
It's our NCAA bracket.,Ted
Big board equals big luck!,Marshall
"Hey, that looks familiar, where did you get it?",Lily
"Hello. Uh, I'm looking for my wife, Ms.Aldrin.",Marshall
There's no school today. It's Saturday.,Cleaner
Of course. How could I forget?,Marshall
Dumb ass.,Cleaner
Big board!,Ted
Big luck!,Marshall
"We found it. No big deal. Anyway, every year, Ted and I go in together on this big money pool out in Staten Island.",Marshall
"Yeah. The winner gets $100,000 stuffed in a duffel bag.",Ted
And you get to keep the duffel bag.,Marshall
Why do you guys put yourselves through this? You lose every year.,Lily
"That's because in the past, we were just guessing. This year, we watched every game, read box scores, tracked injuries. This isn't March Madness. This is March Meticulously Thought-outness.",Ted
Your team lost 20 minutes ago.,Barney
I didn't know they were playing today.,Ted
"You okay, Barney?",Lily
Something strange is going on. I was down at the hardware store trying to get a little somethin' somethin'.,Barney
Wait. You go to the hardware store to pick up girls?,Robin
There are four kinds of women who go to the hardware store by themselves.,Barney
Of course there are.,Robin
"Single, recently single, recently divorced, lesbian who will let me watch.",Barney
You could not be more evil.,Lily
"Sorry. Five. Recently widowed. So, I'm talking to this girl...",Barney
"Look, I'm sure he's in a better place. Now let's find you a sturdier ladder.",Barney
I was only gone for a second when...,Barney
See? Skid-proof.,Barney
The same thing happened at the pet store yesterday.,Barney
Pet store?,Marshall
"Single girl, mid-twenties, looking for a canine replacement for the boyfriend who just dumped her. Instead, finds Barney.",Ted
"God bless you, Ted. You're reading my blog.",Barney
I'm really bored at work.,Ted
"I'd call your ex a dog, but that would be an insult to little Ladybug here.",Barney
"Oh, I want to take her home right now.",Woman
"Not without a chew toy from Uncle Barney first. And when I got back... I'm sorry,I'm already spoiling her but diamond in the rough... Could your heart just melt?",Barney
"Weird, right? Yeah. The same thing happened last week at the museum.",Barney
"Ooh, ooh, ooh!",Lily
Lily.,Barney
You pretend to be a struggling young artist who needs a new muse.,Lily
No. Marshall.,Barney
You're a millionaire art thief casing the joint for a thrill money can no longer give you!,Marshall
Oh. No. Robin.,Barney
"You're going blind, and you're trying to soak up all the beauty in the world before the darkness descends.",Robin
"Bingo! So, I was talking to this girl...",Barney
"At this point, about 83%. Soon, these audio guides will be all that I have left.",Barney
I'm so sorry.,Woman
"My God, you are beautiful. How about I get you a headset so you can see with your ears like I do? I couldn't have been gone more than 20 seconds, but when I came back... Hmm.You know, I also love the smell of great art.",Barney
Why does this keep happening?,Barney
Maybe you're not as good a liar as you think you are.,Lily
"Oh, really? Then why am I not in prison for perjury? But I don't want to talk about work. Something weird is going on here.",Barney
Alan Alda. It was Alan Alda.,Barney
You never gonna believe what just happened.,Lily
"Who was that, um, guy from Mash? The main guy. What...? Hawkeye from Mash. How can I be blanking on this?",Barney
Alan Alda?,Lily
No.,Barney
"Oh, my God. Where is she?",Barney
She must have left. She...,Lily
"Well, she-she said I hooked up with her? What was her name? What did she look like?",Barney
"She didn't say her name, but she had blonde hair, boobs. Kind of trashy.",Lily
Dead in the eyes with an aura of self-loathing and despair?,Barney
Yes!,Lily
"That's all of them. Okay. Stay calm. Let's think this through. One of the girls who I lied to, seduced and abandoned is trying to ruin my life. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out which one it is. Oh, dear God!",Barney
"Some woman that I slept with and screwed over is trying to ruin my life. God, why is this happening to me?",Barney
It's karma.,Lily
"Nah, it's not Karma. She's stripping in Vegas. Plus, we're good.",Barney
"Look, if you want to figure out who it is, why don't you just start by checking your list?",Ted
"My list? Dude, do not pretend you're not the kind of guy who keeps a list of all the girls he's slept with.",Barney
I have one. It's called my marriage license.,Marshall
"Come on, let's see the list.",Ted
"Ted, don't be crass. I would never demean the women that I've slept with by putting their names on some tawdry list.",Barney
"This is a scrapbook of all of the women I've slept with. I made it at the Scrapbook Barn on 7th. Ask for Heloise. Tell her I sent you. What do you think, Lil? You recognize the saboteur?",Barney
"I don't know, Barney. I only saw her face.",Lily
How many of these girls know they're being photographed?,Ted
"All of them, but only about half buy a copy on the way out.",Barney
"Oh, Barney, you're never gonna figure out which one of these is the mystery woman. All of these women have a right to hate you.",Lily
"Oh, Lily, come on, lighten up. I mean, any girl who's gonna be with a guy like Barney and do this or that, or this and that, or do this with those in that... I mean, she should have known what she was getting into.",Robin
Absolutely. And what I do with these women should be between me and them. And you guys. And Heloise. She helped me do the decoupage.,Barney
"I don't know, Barney. I don't recognize any of these women. I mean, some minor celebrities, one government official, and what appears to be a national fast food chain mascot.",Lily
This is impossible. There's too many girls. How the hell am I gonna narrow this down?,Barney
"The top 64 women I've slept with, split into four regions. This tournament will systematically narrow down which girl has the most cause to hate my guts. Last girl standing has to be the saboteur.",Barney
"Absolutely not, Barney. We are not going to make a game out of the women you've tricked into sleeping with you. No way!",Lily
The girl who thought he had 12 hours to live has way more cause to ruin his life than the girl he faked proposed to.,Lily
"It's fake proposal girl. I mean, she hired a wedding planner!",Robin
It's 12 hours to live! That girl flew them both to Paris!,Ted
"Oh, she only bought him a one-way ticket!",Robin
"Okay, okay, everybody! Hands.",Barney
Damn it!,Robin
"Okay, toss up. Thought I was Jorge Posada, or You have my dead wife's kidney?",Barney
Kidney!,Ted
Jorge Posada!,Robin
She bought Yankees season tickets to watch him play!,Lily
That's true...,Barney
It's Dead wife's kidney. How are we even discussing this?,Marshall
Fake baby!,Lily
Lost at sea!,Marshall
Fake baby!,Ted
Lost at sea!,Marshall
I was there. Trust me. It's fake baby.,Ted
"Down to the sweet 16. And coming out of the Upper West Side, we have the number three seed, Girl who thought I owned Google, up against the number seven seed, Girl who thought I was a scuba instructor.",Barney
You got to go scuba instructor.,Ted
You're kidding me!,Robin
She got the bends!,Ted
"Yeah, she did.",Barney
Evil twin!,Marshall
Prince of Norway! How could it not be Prince of Norway?!,Ted
"Barney, you're the tiebreaker.",Robin
I'm going with Evil Twin.,Barney
You're kidding me!,Ted
"Sorry, but I did sleep with that girl twice. As Barney and Larney. Okay, we're down to the Final Four. What do you think, people? Come on, dig deep.",Barney
Oh! I can't decide. It could be any one of them.,Robin
Is that the blackboard from my classroom?,Lily
Come on! Marshall?,Barney
I'm tired and sad.,Marshall
Mosby?,Barney
"I want to call my mom, just tell her I love her.",Ted
"Okay. Then this is as far as we get. The Final Four. It's got to be Meg, Anna, Kate or Holly. We are gonna track these girls down, and you're going to tell me which one approached you at the bar.",Barney
You guys stole my blackboard!,Lily
"Okay, there's her building. When she comes out, I'm gonna hide, and once you figure out if she's the girl from the bar, we run like hell.",Barney
No.,Lily
What do you mean no?,Barney
"That woman, like every woman in your Final Four, deserves an apology, and I'm not telling you if she's the one until hear you say, I'm sorry.",Lily
"Are you nuts? That would involve me speaking to a woman I've already had sex with, which, frankly, is a little t like changing the oil in a rental car.",Barney
"Barney, you're doing this.",Lily
"Lily, this girl hates me. I hooked up with her in an apartment I was pretending was my own, told her I loved her, and then ditched her there. She got arrested for trespassing, bit a cop, and spent eight days in jail. Oh, crap, there she is! If she sees me, she's gonna k*ll me!",Barney
"Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Hey, Meg! Over here! Look who it is! Yo old friend Meg: Barney! Barney?",Lily
"If she k*ll me, I want you to go into my apartment, grab the metal briefcase under my bed and throw it in the East River.",Barney
What are you doing here?,Meg
"Look, Meg, we need to talk.",Barney
"It was all my fault. I know it was, baby. I just came on too strong.",Meg
And I forgive you. I love you.,Barney
"Oh, my God! I love you, too!",Meg
"No! What's the matter with you? Get off of him! Look, she's not the one, but you still owe her an apol...",Lily
"So you remember who this one is, right?",Barney
Yes. You told her you were Ted and that you were an architect.,Lily
"Right, and if you recall, her computer had a web cam and a T-1 line, so I...",Barney
"Yeah, I know, Barney, you showed me. And that still doesn't count as a Christmas present. So go over there and apologize.",Lily
"Ah, there she is.",Barney
Ooh and she's holding hot coffee. Maybe she'll throw it in your face.,Lily
"You're really enjoying this, aren't you?",Barney
I'm making a scrapbook.,Lily
"Anna, hi.",Barney
"Look who it is, Mr. Big sh*t Architect. If you're here to ask me to take down the Web site, forget it.",Anna
What Web site?,Barney
Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.,Anna
"You're right, I do deserve that. That's all I came here to say. You know what? I don't care who knows about it. Excuse me. Excuse me. I, Ted Mosby, am a jerk to women. Tell your sisters. Tell your daughters to stay away! Ted-Mosby-Is-A-Jerk-dot-com.",Barney
"Okay, which one is this again?",Lily
She's...,Barney
Larney! Die!,Kate
Is it her?,Barney
Die!,Kate
Smile.,Lily
You look good. Have you lost weight?,Barney
"We're down to the number one seed. I knew it was Holly. It had to be Holly. Man, I was hoping it wasn't Holly.",Barney
"Barney, did you hear that? Somebody's stealing my truck. Barney? Barney!",Holly
That is the worst thing you've ever done. That's the worst thing anyone has ever done.,Lily
"But in my defense, she was kind of annoying.",Barney
She's gonna k*ll you.,Lily
Barney.,Holly
Holly.,Barney
"Mark, come over here. Barney, this is my fianc√©. Mark.",Holly
Barney? You're the Barney who ditched her in the woods?,Mark
So you're not mad at Barney? Don't you want an apology? An admission of guilt? Your truck back?,Lily
"No, whatever happened was in the past. Mark is my present and my future.",Holly
"And if you ditching Holly in the woods made her stop running around with guys like you, then cheers.",Mark
"Well then, to the last Fourth of July weekend I'll spend getting eaten alive by mosquitoes.",Barney
Fourth of July? We started dating in June.,Mark
We ruined their lives. And the worst part of it is that you didn't apologize to any of those women.,Lily
"No, the worst part is that we still have no idea who my stalker is.",Barney
"Well, that's because you're going about this all wrong. I mean, why chase someone who's following you? All you need to do is go down to the bar, hit on someone, and wait until she turns up.",Robin
That's not a bad idea.,Barney
I'll pretend to be the girl that you're hitting on.,Robin
I don't know. That's a lot riding on a girl who giggles when she lies.,Ted
I do not.,Robin
Have you ever fallen asleep while eating ribs?,Ted
"No. Look, I can do this, okay? I mean, how else are you going to find out who this girl is.",Robin
I'm in.,Barney
"Okay, here's how it's gonna work. Now, Lily...",Robin
"...she knows what you look like, so just hang out at the jukebox, and don't draw any attention to yourself. And the guys will be in the booth, just pretending to have a normal conversation.",Robin
"Talking, we should be talking. Words. Here are words. Why is this so hard? Laughter!",Barney
"And then I'll come in, looking hot as all hell.",Robin
"Wow, you are gorgeous. Oh, God, I know that's awful.",Man
"I just, uh.... Shh, go away. But come back later. And then Barney will make his move.",Robin
"Hey, there, how are you doing?",Barney
"Fine, Barney. I mean, um, fine, stranger.",Robin
"Wow, you really are awful at this, aren't you?",Barney
"Get your hand off my thigh, Barney.",Robin
"It's supposed to look like we're about to hook up, Robin.",Barney
You know I'm curious. What do you say to these girls to get them to come home with you?,Robin
"Usually I just lean in and whisper this one thing in their ear. You're a little turned on right now, aren't you?",Barney
"No. Oh. Look, somebody's watching us. Make your move to the bathroom.",Robin
"Uh, I'm going to go to the bathroom now, but, uh, when I come back we'll go to my place and have sex.",Barney
"Dude, dude, dude, look. Blonde girl heading over to Robin right now. We are go.",Ted
I don't know what to do with my hands. What do I normally do with my hands? ,Marshall
I don't recognize her. She's not on the Top 64.,Barney
Not even on bracket. Cinderella story comes out of nowhere to win the whole thing. That'll warm your heart.,Marshall
Are you okay?,Ted
"I don't even recognize her. I don't remember you. I've spent the last two days trying to remember every girl that I've slept with and all the horrible things that I have done to them. And I have done some horrible things. I mean, at one point, I'm pretty sure I sold a woman. I didn't speak the language, but I shook a guy's hand, he gave me the keys to a Mercedes, and I left her there. I'm the guy who keeps a scrapbook of all of the women I have slept with, but I never thought I was the guy who would sleep with a girl and not even remember her. So from the bottom of my heart, for whatever I did to you, I apologize.",Barney
"Oh, Barney! Oh, I'm so proud of you. That's not her. I'm so sorry.",Lily
What? What?,Barney
"Barney, I'm sorry, that's my friend Sally from work. We just ran into each other.",Robin
So I apologized for nothing?,Barney
"Yes, but it was a great apology. And a perfect way to end my scrapbook. I'm going to call this photo Barney's Redemption. Could you stop giving me the finger?",Lily
"Barney, come back to bed. You have a shuttle launch tomorrow. And that asteroid that's headed for Manhattan, It's not gonna destroy itself.",Woman
A new car!,Ted
"Ted, this is new york city... You're never gonna drive it. This is a really, really stupid purchase, and I'm sorry, but none of us can support it. g*n for eternity!",Barney
You can't call g*n for eternity.,Robin
I just called it.,Barney
"You can't just call things, barney.",Robin
I call that I can call things!,Barney
"Hey, baby.",Lily
Beer.,Marshall
Are you okay?,Lily
Beer.,Marshall
"Okay, what happened?",Ted
They always told me that working at a big law firm was like being at w*r...,Marshall
"...You get out of law school, it's like getting out of boot camp. That first day at work, you're storming the beaches, full of piss and vinegar...",Marshall
"Dude, we're lawyers now.",Man
Totally.,Marshall
We've got briefcases and everything.,Man
Freakin' briefcases.,Marshall
You have anything in yours?,Man
Totally empty. you?,Marshall
Candy bars.,Man
Then you get in the trenches side by side with your buddies. And you feel a sense of camaraderie. But before too long...,Marshall
"Hey, Marshall....",Arthur
"...the shells start to fall. Hello, Arthur.",Marshall
"Arthur Hobbes is one of the senior partners at my firm, and he's... he's my boss. He seems like a nice guy, but he's got a nickname... a*tillery arthur.",Marshall
How's your morning going?,Arthur
It's going fine. How is yours?,Marshall
"Not too bad, not too bad. Hey, is Ferguson in yet?",Arthur
"He is, he's in... just in his office next door.",Marshall
"That's great... have a good one, buddy.",Arthur
"You, too. ",Marshall
"Hey, Ferguson! I read your report, and it's complete crap! No, you know what? That's an insult to crap. If crap could eat and then crap stuff out, it's that! Your report is the crap that crap craps! If you last two more days here, I'll be shocked! Shocked!",Arthur
"It was brutal, But the worst was a few minutes later.",Marshall
Did you hear that?,Ferguson
"Yeah, sorry.",Marshall
Can you believe he did that On Take-your-daughter-to-work day?,Ferguson
"So that brings us to today. A little background. So I'm working on this report called Using 23-b-3 spurious class action precedent to contest a class certification order based on a lack of commonality, numerosity...",Marshall
"Dude, you lost us. Can't you just call it something cool like the ninja report?",Ted
"Okay. yeah, fine, whatever. Um, so I'm supposed to turn in the ninja report yesterday. But I got insanely busy with other stuff, I didn't get a chance to finish it, and then this morning...",Marshall
"Hey, Ferguson.",Arthur
"Hey, Arthur.",Ferguson
How's your day going?,Arthur
I gotta go.,Marshall
Great. how is yours?,Ferguson
"Great, great... Hey, is Marshall in yet?",Arthur
"Oh, thank god. Yeah, he's right in there.",Ferguson
"Fantastic. have a good one, buddy.",Arthur
And then...,Marshall
He screamed at me.,Marshall
"Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.",Lily
"What, that's it? You're upset because a guy talked loudly near you?",Barney
"Barney, I have never been screamed at like that in my life.",Marshall
"Come on, when's the last time you got screamed at at work?",Ted
"I got screamed at three times today. Once in Korean. This is corporate America, Marshall. Screaming is a motivational tool, like christmas bonuses or sexual harassment. It's just good business.",Barney
"Oh, baby, it's just not fair. You've been working so hard. Late nights, weekends. I never see you. We've barely made love in weeks. It's bad, guys, mama needs her sugar.",Lily
"Look, Marshall, he screamed at you, you took it. He probably respects you more for it.",Robin
"Yeah, about that... So Arthur's busy giving me the full screaming treatment... Face turning red, vein in his forehead about to burst, spittle flying like shrapnel. Everyone you work with walking by your office, peering in. And suddenly, I just felt all of it.",Marshall
All of what?,Ted
"All of it. The fact that I became a lawyer to save the environment, and now I'm working for the bad guys instead. The fact that I am stuck in this job because of a mortgage I can barely afford on an apartment that is crooked. The fact that I am a grown man, and nobody, not even a*tillery Arthur, has the right to talk to me like that!",Marshall
I begged my body not to do it. But it was no use. I just... I just...,Marshall
"Just because you weren't around for this, I called g*n for all eternity in Ted's car.",Barney
Dude I can't believe you cried in front of your boss.,Barney
"I don't know what happened. There's just something about being yelled at like that, like I was being scolded by my dad. Suddenly... suddenly I was a little boy.",Marshall
Is boy the right word?,Robin
"I felt absolutely powerless. Flaccid... Hell, I... I felt castrated.",Marshall
"God, you're hot right now.",Lily
"And the worst thing is, tomorrow morning I have to walk into Arthur's office and give him the ninja report.",Marshall
Ooh. ooh. ninjas are cool.,Barney
How the hell am I supposed to face this guy again?,Marshall
Here's what I would do if I were you.,Robin
"Hi, Arthur.",Robin
"Hello, Marshall. Have you finally finished the ninja report?",Arthur
"Yeah, I got it. Right here. I think it's gonna blow you away.",Robin
"Please, I have a family.",Arthur
So we good?,Robin
We're so good.,Arthur
Then why are you still in my office?,Robin
"Okay, g*n violence might be the answer to everything up in Canada, Robin, but here in America, we solve our problems with words. Marshall, you go in and you dazzle this guy with a big eloquent speech defending human dignity. Like abraham Lincoln.",Ted
"Yeah, because it's so easy just to bust out a big, eloquent speech off the top of your head.",Marshall
Observe.,Ted
Arthur?,Ted
"What do you want, Marshall?",Arthur
"Justice, sir. You see, we are all born with certain incontrovertible rights, the most fundamentally paramount of which is the right... Wait, you can't be fundamentally paramount. One means highest, one means lowest.",Ted
You are nailing this.,Arthur
"Human beings have rights, and those rights are, um...",Ted
"You got me hooked, reel me in.",Arthur
There are certain justices that cannot or will not be inalienable... as such... for the future.,Ted
Stuck the landing... bravo! Thank you. Security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.,Arthur
"Guys, guys, this is not helping, okay? I can't have some big confrontation with Arthur. I need this job, i... I need the money.",Marshall
"Yeah, but how good would it feel to walk in there tomorrow, tell him off and then quit?",Ted
"It's great to fantasize about, but nobody ever actually does it.",Marshall
"Gary blauman did it. Guy I used to work with, the guy's a legend now. We were at the morning meeting and old Blauman was getting reamed out but good.",Barney
"Pretty much routine at the morning meeting, but then, on this particular day, something amazing happened.",Barney
"You made yourself look bad, you made this company look bad, and quite frankly, you made our friends, the North Koreans, look bad! And I'll tell you something else, Blauman, if you think for one moment...",Bilson
"You know what, Bilson? You can kiss my ass.",Blauman
"Oh, snap.",Barney
What?,Bilson
"You heard me. I don't need to take your crap anymore. My cousin's website went public today, and I made a pile of money on the ipo, so you know what I think Of this whole damn company?",Blauman
"Oh, my God.",Ted
He peed on the conference table?,Marshall
"Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Uh, look, could you guys just look away for a second till I get started? Come on. Come on.",Blauman
"Eventually, he just gave up and left. And then his cousin's website t*nk. And then he became a janitor at an old folks' home and moved into a one-room apartment above a bowling alley.",Barney
That's it? that's the end of the story?,Marshall
"No, no, of course not... he died.",Barney
"How does that help me? How does any of this help me? Can somebody, for god's sakes, please give me one piece of useful advice?",Marshall
"Lily, control your woman. The lesson of Blauman is that when your boss screams at you, you never scream back. That's why there's a little thing in corporate America I like to call the chain of screaming.",Barney
Chain of screaming?,Marshall
"Yes. The chain of screaming starts at the top. Arthur's boss's boss screams at Arthur's boss. Arthur's boss screams at Arthur. Arthur screams at you. You go home and scream at Lily. Lily screams at one of the kids in her kindergarten class. Then that kid screams at her dad, Arthur's boss's boss. And the whole thing starts all over again, Thus completing the circle of screaming.",Barney
I thought it was a chain of screaming.,Ted
"It's a circle, Ted, I called it a circle.",Barney
I don't scream at Lily.,Marshall
"And I don't scream at my kids, none of whom have parents who work at marshall's firm.",Lily
So it's not a circle.,Robin
"Fine! You want it to be a chain of screaming, it's a chain of screaming. I came up with the circle idea halfway through, 'cause I thought it was a more elegant metaphor, but fine, ruin it! You guys always undermine me when I'm trying to make a point, and I'm sick of it! God, I'm surrounded by idiots! Idiots! See, doesn't everyone feel better now?",Barney
"Lily, I need your take on this. What... what should I do?",Marshall
"Well, what I teach my kids in kindergarten...",Lily
"Oh, God.",Barney
"...When dealing with a bully, the most important thing is to be constructive and positive.",Lily
"Hello, Arthur.",Lily
"Hello, Marshall.",Arthur
"I have the ninja report right here. But Arthur, in the future, if you want someone to do their best work, try to motivate them, not with fear and intimidation, but through encouragement, inspiration and respect.",Lily
"Well said, Marshall, I needed to hear that. By the way, I saw your wife's picture in your office. That is one tasty slice.",Arthur
"Oh, you're damn right. You know what I'm gonna do when I get home?",Lily
"Oh, yeah.",Arthur
I'm gonna rip that girl's clothes off...,Lily
That's it.,Arthur
...just throw her on the bed...,Lily
That's where she belongs.,Arthur
...and drive her home like a pack of sled dogs!,Lily
"It's bad, guys. Mama needs it bad.",Lily
"You're right, baby, it's about respect. That is the first useful thing anyone's said to me tonight. Can you give me that speech again?",Marshall
I'm gonna drive her home like a pack of...,Lily
"No, the other part, please.",Marshall
"I have the ninja report right here, but...",Lily
"Which of these carpets would look better in the new apartment? I like the color of this one, but this one's so soft. It would feel great on your bare feet......or your bare back, a bead of eager sweat rolling down your trembling bosom.",Lily
"Lily, didn't we just go through this with bathroom tiles?",Ted
"Shh, don't say my name. Lily can't know it's me. Just pretend you're talking to Stella. Be all lovey dovey.",Marshall
"Hey, Stella. Sweetie, how's it going?",Ted
"Not good, not good at all.",Marshall
Where are you right now?,Ted
"Right downstairs, come find me. Without Lily.",Marshall
"Okay, I'll see you soon.",Ted
I love you.,Marshall
"I love you, too.",Ted
"Wow, you two are already saying the l word, huh?",Lily
Apparently.,Ted
You hitting that?,Lily
"I'm in trouble, Ted. Ted, I'm freakin' out, man.",Marshall
"Um... it's a new car, so just be careful...",Ted
"I did something stupid, can we just drive somewhere? I need to get away... just drive, man. Please just drive.",Marshall
"It's just, this is a really good parking spot.",Ted
Dude!,Marshall
"Look, just tell me what happened first.",Ted
"Remember how I said I was gonna give that big speech that Lily told me to give, be firm but respectful? Well, it didn't totally go that way.",Marshall
"There is a lot of ketchup on that burger. Sorry, what happened?",Ted
"After we all finished talking last night, I went to the diner to finish working on the ninja report.",Marshall
"Hey, marshall.",Barney
How long have you been sitting there?,Marshall
"If you go in there with Lily's kindergarten nonsense, you're gonna get torn apart. I'm here to save your life. you hungry?",Barney
"Yeah, I was just about to order.",Marshall
What do you want?,Barney
A sandwich and gravy fries.,Marshall
"Okay, friends, what do you like?",Waiter
"A green tea with lemon for me, and for my friend here, the meatloaf, please.",Barney
Very good.,Waiter
"No, I didn't want meatloaf.",Marshall
"Marshall, the chain of screaming is a real thing. Arthur screamed at you... now you have to scream at someone else.",Barney
"No, I don't.",Marshall
"Yes, you do, or else that anger is gonna eat you alive.",Barney
Who would I even scream at?,Marshall
I don't know. How about somebody who's disappointed you? Someone who's let you down. Someone who's gonna bring you meatloaf when you explicitly ordered a sandwich and gravy fries.,Barney
No.,Marshall
"Hey, I was just heading to the bar. What are you guys doing out here?",Robin
"Oh, I was just telling Ted a story.",Marshall
"Ooh, I like stories. You want a lick? What?",Robin
Is that ice cream cone big enough?,Ted
"Uh, it's delicious enough.",Robin
"Okay, so... Then I say to Barney...",Marshall
"I'm not gonna scream at the waiter, barney.",Marshall
"Yes, you are. That waiter is every boss and every bully who ever embarrassed or belittled you. And how dare he deny you the one thing that you want, that would make you happy at this moment. A sandwich and gravy fries.",Barney
"One green tea with lemon, one meatloaf. Enjoy, my friends.",Waiter
Marshall.,Barney
Excuse me?,Marshall
Yes?,Waiter
This is not what I ordered.,Marshall
"Yes, it is.",Waiter
"I beg your pardon, sir, But I ordered a sandwich and gravy fries, And as the customer, I'm always right, so...",Marshall
"No, no, I am not going to stand here and take this! I am at the end of a triple shift... that's 18 hours!... And then I have to take two trains and a bus to astoria to have my wife scream at me because I'm never home. No, no, you eat your damn meatloaf!",Waiter
"Hey, what are you guys doing out here?",Barney
"Oh sweet, can I get a toot?",Robin
"Uh-uh. against car rules, it's against car rules!",Ted
"Oh, Ted, relax, it's Cuban. People pay to have their car smell like this.",Barney
"Well, that's just not true.",Ted
"Oh, Marshall, switch seats with me. I called g*n for all eternity.",Barney
You can't call g*n for eternity.,Robin
"Well, that's funny, cause I did!",Barney
It's case by case.,Robin
"Guys, I'm telling a life-altering story here!",Marshall
"A 20% tip, really, for that waiter?",Barney
"I don't know, Barney, he worked a triple, it just...",Marshall
"I can't believe it! If you're not gonna yell at the waiter, Yell at me.",Barney
What?,Marshall
Yell at me.,Barney
"I'm not gonna yell at you, Barney.",Marshall
"What, you think you're gonna upset me? Please, give me your best sh*t.",Barney
"Okay, fine... what, you want me to yell at you?",Marshall
Yeah.,Barney
"This is me yelling at you, Barney.",Marshall
"I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you over the sound of a butterfly landing on a leaf about three blocks away.",Barney
"This is me yelling at you, Barney!",Marshall
"Okay, you got some volume, now give me some content. Make it hurt.",Barney
You don't look as good in suits as you think you do!,Marshall
"No, something that's true-- come on. The man made you cry. Make me cry.",Barney
Your mom's a slut!,Marshall
Yes.,Barney
"Your mom's a slut, and I'm sorry, Barney, but you and your brother clearly have different fathers, And you know why? It's probably because your mom is a slutty slut!",Marshall
Keep going.,Barney
I don't care what you say. Bob Barker is not your father!,Marshall
"Okay, now, well, that's just not cool.",Barney
"Oh my god, Barney, I'm so sorry...",Marshall
"No, I'm kidding... keep going.",Barney
"Bob Barker's not your father! You've concocted this delusional idea that a game show host is your real father, and he's not! You were abandoned, Barney! You were abandoned, and you never dealt with it, and so now you never allow yourself to feel anything, and that's how you survive in this corporate world, and if I keep heading down this path, I'm gonna turn into you! And I don't want that! I don't want any of this! This is not why I became a lawyer. This is not the person that I wanted to be...",Marshall
"... I quit, Arthur! I quit!",Marshall
"Well, thank you, Eriksen, I needed to hear that.",Arthur
"Really, 'cause I didn't mean to attack you personally, It's just that i...",Marshall
"No, no, no, the part where you said, I quit. Now we don't have to pay you a severance package. Uh, security's gonna rough you up a bit on the way out.",Arthur
"Robin, you dropped a little ice cream...",Ted
Dude!,Marshall
I'm sorry.,Ted
"Don't blame this on me, Marshall. I told you to yell at someone beneath you. The circle of screaming is... The chain of scr... Pyramid... the pyramid of screaming! The pyramid of screaming.",Barney
"How am I supposed to tell lily? She supported me through three years of law school, and now is the time when I'm supposed to pay her back. Now we're gonna lose the apartment. The place where we were gonna raise our children. How am I supposed to tell the person who I love more than anything in this world that I've just thrown away our future?",Marshall
"Everybody out, everybody out of the new car! Out of the new car!",Ted
"Ted, screaming never solves anything.",Barney
"I'm so sorry. I just lost it. But I can fix it. First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go in there on my hands and knees and beg for my job back.",Marshall
"No, you're not.",Lily
What?,Marshall
"Marshall, our future isn't money or an apartment. And it's definitely not you being miserable at that horrible job. I'm just happy to have my husband back. We'll figure the rest out.",Lily
I love you.,Marshall
"I love you, too.",Lily
You sure about this?,Marshall
"Yeah, who needs a car in new york city, right?",Ted
"Ted, I don't think I can accept...",Marshall
"Marshall, don't make me scream at you.",Ted
"Thanks a lot, buddy.",Marshall
"You guys did it in the car, didn't...",Ted
"Oh, yeah!",Marshall
"Coming up next, 'Is your baby trying to k*ll you?'",Robin
"So, I got up this morning, its freezing. So I walked over there. And I don't know why I am still talking. Because clearly we are all asking the same question. What in God's creation is going on with Robin's breasts.",Ted
"I know, right, isn't that amazing? I spent half an hour making these happen. Its tape in there, cotton balls, half of a Nerf football, but it works, right?",Robin
Totally. What's the occasion?,Lily
And old friend from Canada is in town and I'm meeting him for a drink.,Robin
Ooh! Somebody you went to Degrassi with?,Barney
"No. Actually, he was my first boyfriend.",Robin
Simon. I thought he was the coolest guy ever. He smelled like Drakkar. He could ollie on a skateboard. He had the most amazing collection of Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts. We spent the whole summer madly in love.,Robin
"Tell me more. Tell me more. Like, did he have a car?",Barney
"So he's the guy who... How shall I say this like a gentleman? Robin, did he take your maple leaf?",Marshall
"No, it wasn't like that.",Robin
"Sounds to me like he gave you your first O, Canada! face.",Barney
"Wait, wait. Did he break up with you and tell you he's just not that Inuit?",Lily
"Um, something about fur trapping.",Ted
Did you ride his Zamboni?,Barney
"Wait, wait, wait. Did he...? I think I'm out.",Marshall
"Yeah, I'm also oot. Okay, now I'm really out.",Ted
"Well, I'm sorry, guys. It was all very tame. We only dated for a week and a half.",Robin
Wha...? I thought you said you were together all summer.,Barney
"Yeah. Summer in Canada is pretty much the last week of July. Anyway, one night, his band just finish playing this gig...",Robin
"Oh, my God! Simon. That was such a good show. You guys totally rocked out.",Robin
"Yeah. I know. I figure we're about four or five gigs away from really exploding. We're gonna be big, babe. I mean, like Crash-Test-Dummies big. So, that everything? All right. Listen, babe... It's over.",Simon
What?,Robin
I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh.,Simon
Louise Marsh?! That's a whore's name if I ever heard one.,Lily
"Yeah, why would he want to get back together with Louise Marsh?",Marshall
"Well, the thing is... her folks just put in a pool.",Simon
"Oh... So... I totally... I get it. Pools are great. Swimming's awesome. We have a sprinkler. Run right through it. Well, I should go.",Robin
"Uh... Babe, wait.",Simon
"Yeah, Simon?",Robin
You forgot to load the drum set.,Simon
No! Tell me you did not load the drum set.,Ted
I did.,Robin
"And now he's coming here? Robin, why do you want to see this guy?",Marshall
"Oh! I know why. You're gonna win, aren't you?",Lily
I have no idea what you' talking about.,Robin
"Yes, you do. Whenever you haven't seen someone for a long time, no matter how much you want to deny it, there's always a clear winner and a clear loser.",Ted
"Well, since you brought it up, let's add up the points.",Robin
You're starting out with two big ones right there.,Barney
"Thank you. Okay. So, Simon still lives with his mom.",Robin
Point Robin.,Ted
"Um, he never became a rock star.",Robin
Point Robin.,Lily
He now works at a water slide park outside of Ottawa.,Robin
Point Simon.,Marshall
Wait. Do they have a wave pool?,Ted
No.,Robin
Ah. Point Robin. That's five-zip. There's no coming back from that.,Marshall
"Yeah, he's going down. I mean, unless somehow, he got hotter. There he is.",Robin
"Hey, babe.",Simon
"Okay, what the hell just happened?",Ted
"Oh, come on, it wasn't so bad, was it?",Robin
"Hey, Simon.",Robin
"Wow, look at you. You got old.",Simon
"Yeah. You look great. You got hotter, like that's possible.",Robin
"So... Look, I know it didn't go as planned, but I can't help it. I mean... he's still got it.",Robin
Whoa! Four bucks for a brew? What a rip. Good thing I'm packing.,Simon
"So he's not a snob. He's from a different part of Canada, you know? The maple leaf flag on the back of the pickup truck? He's Red Province. He's from the Deep North.",Robin
"The thing is, we gave you so many opportunities.",Marshall
"So, Simon, Robin's a bit of a local celebrity here in New York. She's the lead anchor at Metro News One. Tell him, Robin.",Lily
"No. It's stupid. It's not cool, like Simon's shirt.",Robin
"I'm sorry, Simon. Here we are nattering on about our big celebrity. What do you do for a living?",Barney
"Oh, I work at the Splish Splash Ottawa Water Slide Park.",Simon
Huh! A water slide park. That sure is different than what Robin does.,Ted
"Yeah, it is... because I save lives. If I'm not sitting in that stool at the top of the slide, going... Go.. Go... Go... people die. What, you think it's so easy? You try it.",Simon
Um... ,Ted
You didn't put your hand up; kid just died.,Simon
"No, I didn't know...",Ted
Another kid just went; he died too.,Simon
"Oh, well, sure. I mean, if I was actually...",Ted
"Another kid just went; now you've got a pile-up and Robin's got something to report on the news. This just in: My friend, Ted, just k*ll a bunch of kids today.",Simon
"Well, that's cool. You got to pay the bills somehow since your whole music thing didn't really pan out, did it?",Lily
"Well, it hasn't panned out yet, but the band's still going. About four or five gigs away from really exploding.",Simon
The Foreskins are still playing?,Robin
The Foreskins? How'd you guys come up with that name?,Ted
"Well, there's four of us, and we play without shirts. Babe, seriously.",Simon
I know. I'm sorry.,Robin
"I know. I'm sorry. But you guys just don't understand. The fact that he kept the band going...that's impressive! I mean, I gave up my musical dream.",Robin
Which brings us to the most important piece of information from tonight.,Barney
"So, Simon, how did you guys meet?",Barney
"Oh, I was in her video.",Simon
Starred in it is more like it.,Robin
"Well, once you win Mr. Teen Winnipeg, everybody wants a piece of the moneymaker.",Simon
"I'm sorry. I've seen Let's Go to the Mall about a thousand times, and you, sir, are not in it.",Barney
"No, I was in the other one.",Simon
There's another video?!,Barney
"Robin, seriously, just make this easier on yourself and give us the tape.",Barney
No.,Robin
"All right! You leave me no choice. From this moment on, I will spend every waking minute ching down this tape. I will not sleep. I will not eat. My life will be a living hell of search engines and overseas phone calls, chasing down something that possibly can't be found.",Barney
Okay.,Robin
"It's just... It was so hard to watch, Robin. You're usually so cool.",Marshall
"I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm sitting next to Simon, and suddenly I'm 16 again.",Robin
"Oh, it's actually a common thing. When you're around someone from your past, you kind of revert back to who you were when you knew them. There's not really a name for it, though.",Ted
It's called revertigo.,Marshall
"Yeah, I don't know about revertigo.",Ted
You know who gets really bad revertigo? ,Marshall
Michelle? She sounds hot.,Barney
You don't know about Lily and Michelle?,Ted
No. What about Lily and Michelle?,Barney
"Oh, my friend, you are in for a treat. Hey, Lil?",Marshall
What?,Lily
"You know, I was just thinking, we haven't seen your friend Michelle in a while.",Marshall
"Oh, yeah. I'll give her a call, see if she wants to hang out.",Lily
What... ,Barney
Better.,Marshall
Comparable.,Ted
Comparable.,Marshall
"Whatever. It's over. I lost. I guess you, uh, you don't get second chance.",Robin
I got a second chance.,Robin
What happened?,Lily
He came by my place tonight...,Robin
Simon. What are you doing here?,Robin
I just feel like there's some unfinished business between you and me. Seeing you now... has made me realize that breaking up with you is the biggest mistake I made in my entire life.,Simon
"Oh, I like where this is going.",Robin
"I know this is crazy, and I'm only in town for a couple of days, but do you want to go on a date?",Simon
"He asked you out?! Oh, step into my web, Simon.",Lily
The coup de grace.,Ted
Finish him!,Barney
I'd love to!,Robin
Wait. You're going on a date with Simon? That Simon?The one we met?,Ted
"Robin, this guy doesn't deserve a second chance. Not after the way he treated you.",Lily
"That was ten years ago. People evolve. I mean, are you the same person that you were in high school?",Robin
"Oh, hell, no!",Lily
I think you're gonna enjoy this.,Marshall
That my girl Michelle?,Lily
"Bitch, you know it!",Michelle
How she livin'?,Lily
She living only way she know how to. Large!,Michelle
"Oh, girl, you gots to get your drink on up in here.",Lily
I'm hoping my big ass can hustle me up a vodka-Gatorade.,Michelle
For reals.,Lily
"I want her around all the time. I'd even consider not trying to sleep with her if that's what it takes. Guys, I've decided to seduce Michelle.",Barney
Yeah!,Robin
"Guys, that was great. Let's take five. Hey, babe, did you like it after my bass solo when I flicked my pick at you?",Simon
That rocked.,Robin
"Yeah. Uh, 'cause I'm gonna need that pick back.",Simon
"Oh, uh, sure.",Robin
"Um, I think it... It's cool. You'll find it later.",Simon
"Oh, cool. I wish I didn't have to go to work in the morning.",Robin
"Oh, but, babe, you got to go to work. You got to play our demo on your show.",Simon
"Oh, well, you know, it's not a show. It's the news.",Robin
"Right. So you can be, like Hey, did you hear there's some news? There's a rad band you guys should check out. And then play it. Or just, like, the first three songs.",Simon
"And now it's time for Puppy Corner, some little angels looking for a new home, courtesy of the Midtown Animal Shelter.",Robin
"Hey, a lot of puppies got adopted. Of course, a lot of the people calling in thought we were going to k*ll them.",Robin
"Robin, your revertigo is really starting to affect your work.",Marshall
What's revertigo?,Lily
"It's a stupid, made-up word with no meaning.",Ted
"No. It's a phenomenon where, when you're around people from your past, you start behaving like them.",Marshall
Oh. One example of that springs to mind. I think we all know what it is.,Lily
You do?,Marshall
Yeah. Ted.,Lily
Me?,Ted
"Whenever Ted's friend Punchy comes into town, it's like, all of a sudden, Ted's in high school again.",Lily
"Okay, okay. First of all, his name is Adam Punciarello, and I don't do that.",Ted
"Ooh. That must be Adam. 'Sup, Punchy?",Ted
"'Sup, Shmosby?!",Punchy
You want to go?,Ted
I'm already there!,Punchy
"Dude, seriously, I'm sorry about your dad.",Ted
"Yeah, it was a real shock.",Punchy
"I can't believe you, of all people, are saying this.",Ted
Why?,Lily
No reason.,Ted
"Robin, the point is, what are you doing? I mean, this guy?",Marshall
"Okay, you want the truth? Yeah. I like Simon. I do. We have fun together.",Robin
"Oh, we know you do, honey, but we're worried about you.",Lily
"You're worried? Okay, hold on. Is there any version of this conversation where you guys don't sound like my parents?",Robin
I don't know. Is there any version where you don't sound like a 16-year-old?,Lily
That's exactly what my mom would say.,Robin
"No. If I was your mom, I woulsay, We forbid you from seeing this boy.",Lily
Lily!,Robin
"No, I'm sorry, but it's for your own good.",Lily
This is my life! You guys just don't get it! You've never felt the way that I feel!,Robin
"Now, now. We were once young and in love, too.",Marshall
"Yeah, like, a billion years ago.",Robin
"You've been drinking, haven't you?",Lily
"Yeah, we all have. You bought the last round.",Robin
You're not going to that show tonight!,Lily
"Oh, yes, I am, and you know what else? Tonight, after the show, Simon and I are going all the way.",Robin
"Young lady, get back here! Thanks for your help.",Lily
"Hey, so, today at work...",Ted
"Not now, Ted!",Marshall
Geez.,Ted
"Oh, hey, Simon. Great show. You guys still rock.",Robin
Yeah. They totally dug my bass solo. Man! Why can't I always feel this alive?!,Simon
"God, I just love seeing you so happy.",Robin
"Yeah. About that. Listen, babe. It's over.",Simon
What?,Robin
I'm getting back together with Louise Marsh.,Simon
"Well... I'm sorry, Robin.",Ted
"I'm fine, really.",Robin
"Oh, Robin, I'm gonna tell you for real. Simon's a dawg. You feel me, Chelle?",Lily
"Mm-hmm, for reals. He a scrub.",Michelle
Mm. True dat. I'ma get me my champagne and grape soda on.,Lily
"So, how's Columbia?",Ted
Great! I'm almost done with my dissertation. Hmm. I'm getting a PhD in behavioral psychology.,Michelle
"Um, can I make an observation?",Robin
"Oh. I know. Whenever I'm around Lily, she just brings out that side of me. There's a psychological term for the phenomenon.",Michelle
Revertigo?,Marshall
"No. Actually, it's associative regression. You see, the neural pathways that... Oh, no, you did not just put on my jam! Oh. Put your hands up, girl!",Michelle
All right. I can't find your video. I've wasted three days tr... What's the matter?,Barney
Uh... Simon dumped me in his van after the show.,Robin
"Yeah, Robin, that was, like, ten years ago.",Barney
"No, tonight.",Robin
Ooh. Really? ,Barney
"It's just... when I was young, I was so... vulnerable and-and open to things, you know? And... I guess I just... I wanted to feel that way again. I wanted to be 16 again.",Robin
"Robin, that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out of your mouth. You want to be 16 again? I have watched your first Robin Sparkles video 1,000 times, and it's not because I'm proud of you as a friend. It's because you were totally, totally lame back then. But now, come on. Pa-cow! You're the most awesome person I have ever known. Well, second most awesome.",Barney
"Right. Of course, the-the first being you.",Robin
No. No. The first is this guy who lives in a place called the mirror. What up?! I'm saying that you are way more awesome than Simon ever will be.,Barney
"Barney, do you want to come back to my place?",Robin
Your place?,Barney
Are you sure you want to do this?,Barney
"Yeah. I am. Let's just not tell anyone about this, okay?",Robin
"Of course. So, should I just put it in?",Barney
"Yeah, why not?",Robin
This was my big artistic follow-up toLet's Go to the Mall. It kind of t*nk.,Robin
Is that Tiffany? Mm-hmm. You are so rad. It's everything I want it to be and more.,Barney
"Oh, I'm so glad.",Robin
Is that Alan Thicke?,Barney
Yeah.,Robin
"You know, if you reedit it, there's a tampon commercial in here somewhere. Do you seem how lame you were back then?",Barney
"Yeah, you're right. I was lame.",Robin
"Totally lame. Ugh. And, of course, the robot makes an appearance in the sad love ballad.",Barney
He was my sidekick. He had to be.,Robin
"In my experience, the way this normally goes is, we lie here for a while, make a little awkward chitchat.",Barney
Check.,Robin
"Then I make up some cabinet meeting, heart surgery, rocket test flight I've got to be at, slip out of the apartment and never call you again.",Barney
"And later at the bar, you tell your good friend Robin the story of your latest conquest, and she thinks to herself, who is this sad, self-loathing idiot who climbed into bed with Barney Stinson?",Robin
"Actually, you usually say that out loud. So...I just slept with my best friend's ex-girlfriend",Barney
And I just slept with my ex-boyfriend's really good friend.,Robin
Best friend.,Barney
"Okay, here's the deal, Barney. The second my feet touch the ground, this never happened.",Robin
"Okay. Wait. Right click, save as... Into the.bpeg folder, and okay. This never happened. It's a good plan.",Barney
Now we go back to exactly the way things were before.,Robin
"Okay. Right. So, Robin?",Barney
"Yes, Barney?",Robin
Guess who nailed the chick from metro news one last night?,Barney
"I'm gonna shower... till June, and, um, since you were never here to begin with, you won't be here when I get out.",Robin
Okay. This never happened. Never happened. Never... happened.,Barney
"So, tell us, what was it like?",Ted
What?,Barney
"Penetrating that barrier. You and I are the first ones to hit it. Well, not the first ones, certainly, but the first ones at this table.",Ted
I... I... I'm... I'm...,Barney
"Although, I'm gonna be hitting it pretty soon.",Marshall
"Yeah, you are.",Robin
"Yeah, and when I hit it, I'm going to go nuts.",Marshall
"It's gonna be all night, and I think I want a clown there. I'm a little bit scared of clowns, but for you, I'm there.",Lily
What are you talking about?!,Barney
"The big three-oh. You know, my 30th birthday's this friday. Did you forget? What kind of friend is this guy?",Ted
"Ha-ha right. A great friend, by the way. The best. Is it my imagination, or are these drinks getting smaller? If this were a doctor's office, they'd say, try again. How you doing there, Robin?",Barney
I'm good.,Robin
"Oh, so, I made a a decision. I'm going to go through all my old stuff, And I'm getting rid of anything I have no use for anymore. Hmm. Barney, you want my xbox?",Ted
"Ted, she has a name! And just what are you accusing me of?",Barney
Liking video games?,Ted
I'm gonna get a drink.,Robin
I'll come with you.,Barney
Okay.,Robin
"God, this is awkward.",Barney
What is?,Robin
Being around Ted.,Barney
Why?,Robin
Because of our thing.,Barney
What thing?,Robin
You're really gonna pretend this never happened?,Barney
What never happened? What are you guys talking about?,Ted
Nothing.,Robin
"Guys, cut the act. I know. I know about the surprise party you guys are throwing me. Marshall let it slip earlier today. Hey, I'll totally act surprised and everything. Just be sure to invite Stella.",Ted
"Stella! You have a serious girlfriend now! You're over this one. Robin who, right? Stella makes this one look like a filthy bag of gbabage, am I right? Happy birthday, bro.",Barney
Hello.,Marshall
"Hey, Marshall, I need your help.",Barney
"Yeah, I'm kind of real focused on the job hunt right now.",Marshall
I know. I want to hire you.,Barney
"For the last time, Barney, I will not be your butler.",Marshall
I need a lawyer. I'll pay you.,Barney
How much?,Marshall
A little.,Barney
I'll take it.,Marshall
"Hey. so, I'm reading this, and, I got to say, this might be a little bit over my head. For one thing, I'm fairly certain that if these contracts aren't executed precisely, we will be at w*r with Portugal.",Marshall
"Forget that. That's a Tuesday for me. New shredder. This baby'll chew up a bicycle in 17 seconds. From sky mall. It's all from sky mall. Whenever I get upset, I shop at sky mall. Want a hot dog?",Barney
Of course. Why are you upset?,Marshall
"Marshall, I'm about to tell you a secret that you can't tell anyone-- not Ted, not Robin, not Lily.",Barney
"No. no, no, no, I don't want any more secrets, especially now that I know what you guys did to the drinking water in lisbon. I...",Marshall
"You are hearing this secret, Marshall. I... I slept... ",Barney
You slept with Robin?,Marshall
Are you mad at me?,Barney
I don't know.,Marshall
How's the hot dog?,Barney
"It's helping. You slept with Robin?! I... I cannot keep that secret. I mean, you know I at least have to tell Lily.",Marshall
You can't. you can't tell anyone. Attorney-client privilege.,Barney
Why are you doing this to me?!,Marshall
"Because I need you, Marshall, as my lawyer, to prove that I didn't do anying wrong.",Barney
"How can I help you as your lawyer? You didn't break any laws, did you? Robin knows you slept with her, doesn't she?",Marshall
"I didn't break any state or federal laws, but I think I broke a much, much higher law. The Bro Code.",Barney
Bro Code article one:Bros before hoes.,Barney
"Bro Code article 89: The mom of a bro is always off limits, but the stepmom of a bro is fair game if she initiates it, and/or is wearing at least one a article of leopard print clothing.",Barney
Bro Code article 34: Bros cannot make eye contact during a devil's three-way. Two dudes.,Barney
This is not a legal docume.. This is just something you wrote.,Marshall
"You think I wrote that? Oh, Marshall, don't you know the glorious history of the Bro Code?",Barney
The year was 1776. The place: Philadelphia. Benjamin Franklin and George Washington were hangng a drink.,Barney
"But, bro, seriously, I called the dibs on that wench. You codpiece blocked me.",Benjamin
So what if I did? There's no rule against it.,George
"Well, there should be. There should be a set of rules that govern the way bros comport themselves among other bros.",Benjamin
"But who shall write such a document? I have to go to Me, D.C.,and pose for the dollar bill.",George
And I have to do some kite-flying or setething.,Benjamin
I shall write this set of rules. And I shall inscribe it on theacack of the Constitution. To save paper.,Barney
It's resolved! Barney Stinson shall write... the Bro Code.,George
And I shall l include a provision that stateth No eye contact in a devil's three-way.,Barney
Seconded.,Benjamin
Seconded.,George
"Listen, what do you want me for?",Marshall
"I've just been losing my mind lately, and do you know why I feel so bad?",Barney
"Yeah, because you slept with Robin.",Marshall
"No, that was awesome. I feel bad because the Bro Code clearly states No sex with your bro's ex. But if you, my lawyer,can find a loophole somewhere, then that bad feeling will go bye-bye.",Barney
And you would pay me for that?,Marshall
"No, I'll just be the one shredding your paperwork. Technically, you'll be paid by a toy factory in Pyongyang.",Barney
"Barney, I'm no shrink, okay, but don't you see that this is just a desperate way for you to avoid an unpleasant confrontation with Ted?",Marshall
"Hey, if I wanted a psychological evaluation, I'd hire the guy we pay to hint notize us before depositions. Now, get cracking!",Barney
"And with a little luck, in a few days, Farmer Frank's cold will be all gone. And that's why Farmer Frank's breath smells like medicine. Right, Farmer Frank?",Lily
"You got it, toots.",Frank
Any last questions for Farmer Frank? Yes.,Lily
Will we ever go to see Missy the Goat again?,Girl
"Oh! Ah, isn't that sweet! Well, you know, honey, right after this, I'm gonna drop old Missy off at the butcher shop. And they're going to take a great big kn*fe...",Frank
"Ms. Aldrin, please don't let emem eat Missy.",Girl
"I know, I know. I already called an animal rescue, and they're going to come get her on Monday.",Lily
"Monday?! Where's she going to sleep and eat and go to the bathroom?! Okay, where's she going to sleep and eat?",Ted
I-I guess I'll keep her up on the roof.,Lily
"Look, call me crazy. I just... I don't think having a goat in the apartment is a good idea.",Ted
"Hey, Ted. You ready to, um... Where'd the goat turd come from?",Robin
How'd you know that was a goat turd?,Ted
"Well, it was either that, or a musk ox turd, and I figured,what the hell would a musk ox be doing in here?",Robin
Hey. Guess what your wife brought home.,Ted
Attorney-client privilege.I can't talk about it.,Marshall
Talk about what?,Ted
"Nothing. How was your day? Oh, goat turd on the floor,I see. Is that new?",Marshall
How does everyone know that's a goat turd?,Ted
Barney told you.,Robin
"I don't know what you're talking about,madam.",Marshall
"Marshall, you can't look me in the eye, you're blushing, coughing, and your hands are shaking.",Robin
"Robin, come here!",Ted
"Ted is never finding out about this, you understand? Because it never happened, none of us are saying anything. And don't even think about opening that can until I'm out of the splash zone.",Robin
"Fantastic, you're here. Give me the good news.",Barney
I'm sorry. You did too good of a job writing this thing. It's-it's iron-clad.,Marshall
"No! Bad lawyer! I need a loophole! I want to feel better, Marshall! I can't keep buying things! I have six self-cleaning litterboxes and I don't even have a kid. Wait. How about this? Ted's probably broken this thing himself, right? And if he's broken the Bro Code, then I'm off the hook.",Barney
"I thought about that. And I gotta say, Ted has upheld this thing time and time again. For example, article 87: A bro shall at all times say yes.",Marshall
So he saved you from an avalanche?,Woman
Yes.,Ted
And he carried you six miles to safety on his broken leg?,Woman
Yes.,Ted
And you're a pre-op transsexual nightclub singer who used to be a member of the Russian mob?,Woman
Da.,Ted
Article 29 A bro will in a timely manner alert his bro to the existence of a girl fight.,Marshall
"Dude, two girls are fighting at MacLaren's.",Ted
What?!,Barney
"Yeah, yeah. It was crazy. This one girl was like... Oh, hey.",Ted
Hey.,Barney
"Article 53: A bro will, whenever possible, provide his bro with protection.",Marshall
That feels nice.,Woman
Good.,Barney
I just wish we had some wine.,Woman
"Yeah. I wish we had some wine, too.",Barney
"Damn it, Marshall. I'm not paying you to tell me what a saint Ted is! You're my lawyer! The answer is in there! Find it!",Barney
"Okay, this isn't about the Bro Code, and you know it. The reason that you're upset is because what you did was wrong. And the only way you're ever gonna feel any better about it is if you tell Ted what you did.",Marshall
What if he never wants to talk to me again?,Barney
"Well, I guess that's just a chance you're gonna have to take.",Marshall
"Hey, where are you?",Lily
"I'm in the limo, right outside of Ted's office.",Barney
"Great. Well, everyone's here. Stella just arrived and there is something here so awesome, I'm not going to tell you what it is, but you won't believe...",Lily
Goat in a party hat?,Barney
"Damn it! Well, you still gotta see it. It's so much fun having a goat at a party!",Lily
"Uh, gotta go. Here he comes.",Barney
Okay. Bye.,Lily
"Whoa, you guys went all out.",Ted
"Okay, everyone, Ted's in the limo, five-minute warning! Everyone get ready! Oh, Missy, are you excit?? Yes, you are!",Lily
"Whoa, we're leaving the city. Where the hell is this party?",Ted
Vegas.,Barney
Vegas? I thought the party was on the rooftop.,Ted
"Surprise! Just a decoy, my friend.",Barney
So there's no roof party?,Ted
"Oh, no. There is. We're just not going. This is how good a friend I am. They want you to spent your 30th standing around drinking flat beer ten feet above your living room. But not me, bro. I pulled out all the stops. Private jet, Valderrama suite at the Bellagio. Steaks at BOA, scotch at Ghostbar, then two ringside seats to watch Floyd Mayatather go ten rounds with, wait for it... a grizzly bear!",Barney
"Take me home, Barney.",Ted
"No! We have to go to Vegas. Look, Ted, I didn't want to say this, but... there's something that I have to tell you, and I wanted you to be in the best possible frame of mind before you heard it.",Barney
You slept with Robin.,Ted
You slept with Robin? Barney! That is Ted's ex-girlfriend!,Ranjit
When did you find out?,Barney
"Hey, Robin. Come here!",Ted
What's up?,Robin
"I was, uh, just going through some old stuff and I...",Ted
"Oh, crap!",Marshall
"Anyway, uh, I came across this.",Ted
From my vacacation in Vermont.,Robin
"Yeah. I don't know if you'd even want it, but if you do, it's yours.",Ted
I slept with Barney!,Robin
What?,Ted
"It was just one time, it, it was the night that Simon dumped me and I was in a really vulnerable place and I, I wanted to just pretend like it never happened, but I couldn't, and... I can't. I just, I had to tell you. And... I just hope that we can still be friends.",Robin
Of course we can still be friends.,Ted
So you're not mad?,Robin
"Well, I'm... it's a little weird, but, um... No, I'm not mad.",Ted
So you're not mad?,Barney
"No, I'm not mad. I mean, Robin and I broke up a year ago. We've, we've both dated lots of people since then. I'm with Stella now. Seriously, I...I'm fine with this.",Ted
I'm so relieved to hear you say that.,Barney
"Yeah. Yeah. Oh, hey, I just remembered, um, my mom is coming into town next month. Maybe you'd like to nail her, too!",Ted
Where are they?! I'm getting a cramp.,Marshall
"Marshall, can we keep the goat?",Lily
No.,Marshall
But she's so cute and furry and soft.,Lily
"Yeah, and she also sheds, eats out of the garbage and can't control her bobowels.",Marshall
Why don't we just call Duluth Mental Hospital and say my Uncle Linus can live with us?,Lily
"Yeah, Lily, that may seem like a good idea after a couple of drinks but tomorrow morning you're going to want this thing out of your house.",Robin
"Oh, you should talk.You slept with Barney.",Lily
Marshall!,Robin
I'm sorry! I couldn't take it anymore.,Marshall
I can't believe you did that. That's so gross. Was it amazing?,Lily
"What? I... Lily, I really don't want to talk about this.",Robin
I know but it's Barney. It's just hard not to be curious. Did he have like devices and stuff?,Lily
"Lily,come on.",Robin
Hot wax?,Lily
Stop it.,Marshall
Did he tie you to anything?,Lily
That's enough. What's wrong with you?,Marshall
I'm sorry. Is he all smooth down there?,Lily
Three billion women on the planet! Three billion! And you have to sleep with the one that I dated for a year! Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?! Robin?!,Ted
You think I'm proud of this?! I'm horrified that this happened.,Barney
"How did it happen? Huh? Barney, I want to know. Tell me exactly how it happened.",Ted
You mean... what position? ,Barney
Hit him!,Ranjit
Ted! Stop!,Barney
Hit him!,Ranjit
Stop!,Barney
Hit him!,Ranjit
Okay. Okay. You're pissed. You deserve to be. Fine. You know what? One free sh*t. On me. Anywhere but the face. ,Barney
"You think that this is just about Robin? This is about... You know, I've seen you do some bad stuff. I mean some really terrible stuff to a lot of different people. I just always thought there had to be a limit. I always thought I was the limit. You're always spouting off these rules for bros. Isn't one of them, don't do this?",Ted
"Yeah. And I broke it. I'm sorry. But, Ted...seriously, this suite at the Bellagio...",Barney
"I am not going to Vegas with you! I'm not going to blow off my friends and my girlfriend, and spend my 30th birthday in a strip club. The fact that you think I would... You know, Barney,earlier this week I started putting things in a box and that box was labeled stuff I have no use for anymore.",Ted
What does that mean?,Barney
It means... maybe you belong in that box.,Ted
Are you saying you don't want to be bros anymore?,Barney
I'm saying I don't want to be friends anymore.,Ted
"Okay, I'm going to stop you right there, because it seems like you're about to say something that's going to pretty much ruin Vegas.",Barney
"Ranjit, stop the car. I'm getting a cab.",Ted
Surprise!,Everyone
"Now kids, the spring of 2008 was a complicated time in your old man's life.  The last time I had seen Barney was shortly after I found out he has spent the night with Robin.",Narrator
Are you saying you don't wanna be bros anymore?,Barney
I'm saying I don't wanna be friends anymore.,Ted
"It's Barney.  Dude, seriously you need to stop calling me.",Ted
"Yeah I never called you, you called me fifteen times and my parents twice.",Ted
"I'm sorry, I gotta let you go. It's just too many good wingmen out there. Ted are you crying?",Barney
No I'm not.,Ted
"Sh! Let it out, let it out.",Barney
Goodbye Barney. ,Ted
So are you two back together?,Lily
No.,Ted
I miss Barney. I haven't high five with anyone like a week. I think I might be starting to lose my fist bone careless.,Marshall
Let me ask you something Ted. Why are you so much madder at Barney than me?,Robin
Yeah! She had just as much sex with Barney as Barney had with her.,Lily
You know what? I'm not sure that's true. I think I actually prefered if you are mad at me. This is too weird.,Robin
I'm not mad at anybody. I've forgiven you. And I've outgrown Barney as a friend. It's that's simple.,Ted
I will tell you why he is not mad. Because he is so happy with Stella.,Lily
She was right.  Stella and I had been dating for two months. And things were going really well.  She had mat my friend in past for flying colors. There was just one little problem.,Narrator
"You guys haven't had sex yet!!?? When Marshall and I were two months, we were doing it 24/7.",Lily
"I know, I was in the top bunk. Also sat next to you at football games.",Ted
So what you guys waiting for?,Lily
"I think she wants to make sure we are serious first, that's why she hasn't introduced me to her daughter either. She wants to take things slow.",Ted
"Wait, so you haven't had sex since like Thanksgiving. Do you know how many big federal holidays have come and gone since then.",Marshall
"Oh baby, do you remember Martin Luther King day?",Lily
"Yeah, I do. We ode that dude big time.",Marshall
"Look, I'm crazy about this girl, if waiting is what it takes, then I'm fine with that. And totally unrelated note. Does anybody have gamma icer or a piece of bark that you are not chewing?",Ted
"Hey Barney, new sky mall come in. So worldaround blog's fear is you are looking for a new wingman. I wanna let you know, I'm available. Just the say the word, or don't even say the word. Just do something with you eyebrow. Was that it?",Randy
"No offence Randy, but there is a long list of candidats for this slot. This slot is for vice president of awesome. And you are like assistant under secretary of only ok.",Barney
"Assistant under secretary of only ok. Thank you, I will not let you down.",Randy
So uncle Barney began to search for a new wingman.,Narrator
"Pitt, Barney Stinson!",Barney
"Hey! I haven't been calling you, it has been a while.",Pitt
"Yeah. Yeah. So, listen you should meet me in McLaren's tonight.",Barney
You never gonna believe this. I'm at the hospital. Just had a baby daughter.,Pitt
So what do you think? 9:30 or 10 o'clock? ,Barney
"Starry Porten, Barney Stinson.",Barney
"What up, chef?",Starry
"I need a new bro, what do you say?",Barney
"Dude, I'do love to but now I'm bro with Duck Stan.",Starry
"Oh, I understand. Duck Stan is a good bro. I'm happy for you. Best of luck. ",Barney
Crazy Willie! Barney Stinson.,Barney
"What up B dog, long time no bro, so are we gonna tire it up tonight or what?",Willie
Yes finally!,Barney
"Here is what on the rocket tocket. My wife is gonna put the cheese out at seven, scrabble at 8:00 PM, 9 PM we watch 27 dresses, everybody's home by 11:00. Booya! ",Willie
Hello?,Willie
Hanging up on you once wasn't enough. ,Barney
"So I lanced this thing on this guy's back, and I'll be honest with you, I didn't even know what it was, and then it exploded like a volcano. Plus everywhere.",Stella
"Let's have sex. Right now, I'll lock the door.",Ted
"Oh, there is no lock on that door.",Stella
"We can do it against the door. It'll be hot! It'll be like a three-way: you, me and the door.",Ted
"Yeah, but then it's just gonna be weird between me and the door tomorrow.",Stella
I'm sorry. We're waiting. It's cool.,Ted
You've been so patient Ted. The truth is... I'm kind of nervous. I have a confession to make.,Stella
I was afraid of this. You're 14.,Ted
"No, um... it's kind of embarrassing, but it's been a while since I was intimate with anyone.",Stella
Wow. It's funny that you say that. Me too.,Ted
Really? How long it's been for you?,Stella
It's been a while.,Ted
Tell me.,Stella
Me too!,Stella
It's been five months for you too?,Ted
"Wow. Stella hasn't had sex since 2003. Let's just put this in context. The last time Stella had sex, the movie, Seabiscuit, had just galloped into the theaters... and our hearts.",Marshall
"Five years! God, if I even went one year, I would be out on the street selling it for a nickel.",Lily
"The last time Stella had sex, the world was just learning about SARS.",Marshall
"Well, Ted, what else did she said? Did she gave you any kind of explanation?",Robin
"Look, after Lucy was born, I dated a little, but it was hard to find a guy I could trust enough. Sooner or later, every one of them gave me a reason not to.",Stella
But nobody in five years?,Ted
"Look, Ted, guys regret the girls they didn't sleep with. Girls regret the guys they do sleep with. And for the past five years, I've had no regrets. Ted, you're staring at my boobs.",Stella
"In my defense, they were staring at me.",Ted
So what does this mean for you? Is she ever wanna want to get intimate?,Lily
Actually...,Ted
"But the truth is, I really do want to do this with you. I don't think I'd regret it at all.",Stella
Your pillow talk's a little rusty.,Ted
"You know what I mean Ted, I'm ready.",Stella
That's great. Like right now ready? ,Ted
"So, her sister's driving up to baby-sit Lucy, and we're getting a hotel room in the city Saturday night.",Ted
"The last time Stella had sex, The Da Vinci Code had just come out.",Marshall
Well that's doesn't seem like that long ago.,Robin
"Not the movie, the book.",Marshall
Wow.,Robin
"It's a lot of pressure, isn't it?",Ted
You know what? It's not. This woman needs it bad. Anything you do is going to be fireworks. I remember my longest drought...,Lily
It was that summer I lived in San Francisco. I hadn't had been with Marshall since two months and 19 days. ,Lily
"Oh, San Francisco!",Lily
"I don't know Lily, after five years, her expectations have gotta be pretty high.",Ted
I really gonna have to bring my A-game to satisfy this woman.,Ted
"Yeah, it'll be pretty hard now that she's dead.",Robin
Not Nell Carter... Stella.,Ted
"Dude, relax, it's all about expectations management. Do you know why I hated Jerry Maguire so much?",Marshall
Because you're dead inside?,Ted
"No, because you built it up for, like, two weeks, saying it was the greatest movie ever. With Stella, do the opposite: lower expectations.",Marshall
"Right, right, and then no matter what happens, she'll be happy.",Ted
No. ,Robin
"Hey, Randy. Could you come here for a minute?  Good news. I'm calling you up to the majors. Starting tomorrow night, how would you like to be my new wingman?",Barney
Uh... Just need to check my calendar. Be right back.  Tomorrow works.,Randy
I have a surprise appetizer for us today. Check it out. Potato skins.,Ted
Fancy?,Stella
"Yeah. Right? God, it's been forever since I had potato skins. I remember them as being pretty much the most delicious things ever.  Huh. That's surprising.",Ted
What?,Stella
"This potato skin. It's good but not nearly as good as I'd built it up to be in my head. Even though potato skin performed admirably, and is a totally respectable size... I couldn't enjoy it because of my own unrealistic expectations.",Ted
"Hmm, Ted, I see what you're doing. You're trying to lower my expectations for tonight. Is this a lengh thing?",Stella
No.,Ted
Quick on the draw?,Stella
No.,Ted
Unexpected number of testicules?,Stella
"No. It's just that this is a big deal for you. I mean, it's like your virginity: the sequel. ",Ted
Virginity 2: Eletric Boogaloo?,Stella
"Exactly, and I don't want to mess it up. I don't want you to ever wonder if was worth it.",Ted
"Oh Ted, of course it's gonna be worth it. Stop worrying. It's you and me. It already has everything it needs. ",Stella
Unexpected number of testicules?,Ted
It happens. I knew a guy in med school... we used to joke that we was one ball away from getting walked. ,Stella
Hey.,Barney
What up bro-seph Lieberman?,Randy
"No, uh-uh. Randy, we never use the word bro in the name of a failed Democratic vice presidential candidate.",Barney
Goodbye Geraldine Ferrar-bro.,Randy
"You know what? I'm excited about this, Randy. You will be my next masterpiece. It's like with Ted. When I first met him, he was an even bigger loser than you.",Barney
What a loser.,Randy
"But tonight, I'm going to make you the greatest wingman in the history of wingmen.",Barney
"Oh, it's gonna be easier than you think, bro. Yeah. I've been reading your blog for years. You are like a God to me. That's why tonight is going to be legendary... wait for it... dary.",Randy
"Oh, okay, Randy, let's do this. ",Barney
Ok.,Randy
You ready?,Barney
"Yes.  No, no, no, no, no, no!",Randy
What? What's the matter?,Barney
"Nothing, let's do this.  No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please! Just wait, just wait, just wait, just wait!",Randy
Randy what are you doing?,Barney
"Dripping with game, that's what i'm doing. Okay let's go. No. Yes. No! Randy listen to me: you can do this okay? Ok. I don't know. Are thos girls really that hot? Yes, they're hot. Let's do this. Okay!",Randy
"Hey, laddies. Have you met... ",Barney
Hey.,Ted
Hey.,Stella
"So, here's the plan. Take a horse-drawn carriage through the park, and it just so happens the Philharmonic is playing an open-air...",Ted
Ted. Five years.,Stella
Straight to the hotel?,Ted
Straight to the hotel.,Stella
I'll get my bag. ,Ted
"Hey, guys.",Stella
Hey.,Lily
"Hey. So, uh, looking forward to tonight?",Marshall
Yeah. Definitly. It's been such a long time since I've had a night out.,Stella
Yeah. We heard. I would explode if it had been that long since I had a night out.,Lily
This one wakes me up at 4am sometimes just to have a little night out.,Marshall
"Um, what are you guys talking about?",Stella
Nothing. Pizza. What are you talking about?,Lily
Hey guys.,Ted
"Ted, you told them, didn't you?",Stella
Told them what?,Ted
You told them that I haven't had sex in five years. ,Stella
You haven't had sex in five years??!! That is a shocking revelation that we're just finding out right now!,Marshall
"Stella, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told them. But they're my best friends. I tell them everything. I-I didn't even think about it.",Ted
"Ted, that was so personal. Plus, now your friends think I'm a freak.",Stella
"No, they don't.",Ted
"Look, I realize it's weird, okay? Not many people go five years without having sex.",Stella
13 years??!!,Barney
I peaked really young.,Randy
That's why it was difficult for me to tell you. But I did tell you because I thought that I could trust you.,Stella
You can trust me.,Ted
"Obviously, I can't. You know there's always a reason not to sleep with a guy, and you just gave me yours.",Stella
"Wait, did I gave you a reason or were you looking for one?",Ted
Why would be looking for one?,Stella
"So I threw the pressure air oxygen into its mouth. I sh**t the t*nk, boo, nomore shark. Mr. Hall and I swam back to shore. Hey,let me serve you a drink.",Barney
So where were we?,Barney
Jerk!,Woman
Again? Really? Wait...,Barney
"Hey, excuse me. Did I sleep with you and then totally screw you over?",Barney
No.,Woman
What are you doing on Friday?,Barney
Stop! Amy?,Barney
Abby.,Abby
Riiiggghhhttt!!!,Barney
A rainbow! That's beautiful! What a beautiful rainbow! Another rainbow? It's beautiful!,Lily
"You're kidding me. Seriously, aren't you sick of these things?",Lily
"Hey, how was your day?",Ted
"Today, I yelled at a little girl for painting a rainbow.",Lily
A rainbow? Sounds like that bitch had it coming.,Ted
"So, uh, I just met with the contractor. and it turns out, that fixing the floors of the new apartment is going to cost a lot more than the estimate.",Marshall
But we can barely afford that to begin with.,Lily
"I hate to say this, but I think you're going to have to sell your stuff.",Marshall
"Whoa! Marshall, that's just a game we play in the bedroom.",Lily
I mean your clothes. All those designer pieces and everything.,Marshall
What? Why just my clothes?,Lily
"We can sell my stuff, too, but I got to tell you, I think your Marc Jacobs cocktail dress is going to go for a lot more than my Split Happens bowling shirt.",Marshall
Dude.,Ted
I'm not selling that. I've already made the Website.,Marshall
You made a Website?,Lily
"Yeah, it's called Lily-and-Marshall-sell- their-stuff-dot-com.",Marshall
"No, you know what would be a better name for the site? Guy-forces-his-wife- to-dress-in-a-garbage-bag- for-the-next- three-years-dot-com. That's real.",Lily
I'm worried. That woman is actually wearing a-a garbage bag.,Marshall
"Hmm, but, girlfriend, you cannot pull off a tall kitchen.",Lily
Why are you trying to ruin my life?,Barney
"Well, you slept with me and then you never called me again.",Abby
And?,Barney
That's it.,Abby
"That's it? As far as I'm concerned, if I leave you safe on dry land with adequate transportation home, you've got nothing to complain about.",Barney
"Well, it hurt, okay? And then Ted, the love of my life started dating my boss instead of me. Do you know how that feels?",Abby
"Oh, boo-hoo, poor little Ashley.",Barney
Abby!,Abby
"Abby. A few weeks ago, Ted dumped me as his wingman. You had a crush on him for a couple weeks? I was Ted's best friend for seven years.",Barney
Ted said Marshall was his best friend.,Abby
Seven years!,Barney
Sorry.,Abby
Ted. What an idiot. With his stupid meaningful relationship with Stella.,Barney
I hate Ted.,Abby
I hate Ted more.,Barney
Are you as turned on as I am?,Abby
Probably not quite as much.,Barney
I'm sorry I yelled out Ted.,Abby
I'm sorry I yelled out Abby.,Barney
I am Abby.,Abby
"Oh, cool.",Barney
This is insane. Has Lily even worn half this stuff?,Ted
"Oh, yeah, like there's nothing in your closet you've never worn?",Robin
"As a matter of fact, no, there isn't.",Ted
"Whatever, red cowboy boots.",Robin
Those are nice boots. I totally pull those off.,Ted
"Hey, Lil, if I were to say Ted could never pull them off, What would I be talking about?",Marshall
His red cowboy boots.,Robin
I totally pull them off! It's a classic Western look.,Ted
"Oh, okay, uh, today's category: classic Westerns that involve red cowboy boots. Ooh, ooh! Robin.",Marshall
"The Good, the Bad, and the Fabulous.",Robin
The Magnificent Kevin.,Lily
No Country for Straight Men.,Marshall
I don't want to sell my clothes!,Lily
"Oh, I know, sweetie. Come here. Is this a hundred percent silk?",Robin
"Lily,listen, we really need the money. I have some leads on a job, but until then, I just... I don't know what else we can do.",Marshall
I'll sell my paintings!,Lily
What?,Marshall
"Yeah, I'll sell my paintings. Good oil paintings go for like, $500.",Lily
Yeah. Totally. But...,Marshall
I love it. It's a masterpiece. That's it. We're selling the TV. I just want to come home and stare at this all day. Aw. Somebody call the cops! My wife stole an awesome painting from the museum!,Marshall
...that kind of money only goes for real paintings.,Marshall
What does that mean?,Lily
"Look, it just, it just means that-that we need money right now and I'm not sure that selling your paintings is-is how we're going to get it.",Marshall
You don't believe in me.,Lily
"No, wait, wait! Of c... of course I believe in you!",Marshall
"Marshall, I am proud of my work as an artist. My paintings are good. I bet Robin would buy one. What now?",Lily
"I love your painting, I just... I'm trying to be realistic.",Marshall
"Well, how much money do we need for the contractor to finish the job?",Lily
"About 1,500 bucks.",Marshall
"Okay. So, if I can sell three of my paintings at 500 bucks a pop, then I get to keep all my clothes.",Lily
"Babe, we need money fast.",Marshall
"Well, give me a week.",Lily
"Okay, a-a week.",Marshall
Fine.,Lily
Fine.,Marshall
Pulling... Them... Off.,Ted
I love it.,Woman
You do?,Lily
"Yeah, your top. It's gorgeous. Is that 100% silk?",Woman
It's not for sale! My clothes are not for sale!,Lily
We've been sitting here for hours and nobody's even glanced at my painting. Come on. Let's start talking it up.,Lily
Wow! I really like that painting! It's neat! The-the colors are neat. The-the shapes are neat. It's really just... neat. What?,Robin
"Observe. I think there's a dynamic quality to the brushwork that, combined with the fluid composition, creates an almost Kandinsky-like emotional resonance.",Ted
"Yes, and you can still enjoy it even if you're not a pretentious douche.",Robin
Can you clarify something for me about your critique? Are the colors neat or are they more neato burrito?,Ted
"Uh, then again, red cowboy boots.",Robin
I pull these off! (,Ted
You know what I hate most about Ted?,Abby
What?,Barney
"His stupid hair. His stupid, lame awesome hair. It's so stupid and awesome.",Abby
You know what I hate most about Ted?,Barney
What?,Abby
"How he's always like, Oh, I want to fall in love and have a relationship. I care about the people I have sex with. He's so lame.",Barney
He's so lame and awesome.,Abby
You know what he needs? He needs to see just how horrible he is when he's in a relationship.,Barney
"Yeah, and I need to show Ted that I'm over him. Are you thinking what I'm thinking?",Abby
I think so.,Barney
You're thinking of having sex with Ted?,Abby
Painting for sale! $500! Lifelong dream hanging in the balance! It's like they don't even see us.,Lily
"Yeah, we're dirt to them. What do you need money for?",Man
"Oh, I'm trying to fix the hardwood floors in my new apartment. You?",Lily
Heroin.,Man
Do you like heroin?,Lily
"Love it. In fact, if you sell that, I'm going to take your money and go buy some more heroin.",Man
"Thanks for your honesty, Crazy Sock Guy. Oh, I'm never gonna sell this...",Lily
It's not very good.,Man
"2 Oh, my God!",Man
"500 bucks! Who's a real painter now, Marshall?",Lily
"Honey, I never said you weren't a real painter.",Marshall
"Oh, I know, sweetie. And since I'm a professional artist now, I'm going to sketch you an Aldrin original, you know, to say thanks for being such a supportive husband. I'm thinking about calling it... Suck It!",Lily
"Lily, come on. I'm proud of you. Who-who bought it?",Marshall
"Well, that's the best part. A gay couple without kids. A G-CWOK!",Lily
You bagged a G-CWOK?!,Ted
"Yeah, that's right. They are the heart and soul of the art-buying community.",Lily
You know what you should do? You should call up the G-CWOKs and offer them a free painting if they throw a private art party for all their G-CWOK friends.,Ted
"That's an amazing idea. I'm going to go call them. I can probably sell two more paintings with time to spare. Oh, wait, Marshall. There was something I had to tell you. What was it? Oh, that's right. Suck it.",Lily
"Ted, fancy bumping into you here. Have you guys met my girlfriend Abby?",Barney
"Uh, yeah.",Ted
"Hi, Abby.",Barney
"Hello, Abby. So, uh, s-so you guys are dating now?",Ted
"That's right. I am done with this whole being awesome thing. Now I'm all about farmers' markets and day hikes in matching khaki cargo shorts. Isn't that right, sweetie?",Barney
"That's right. And girlfriends are lame. Unless they're me. I miss you, Ted.",Abby
"Abby and I are in love. Not hot passionate love. Couple love. You know, movie night with my girlfriend, then waiting for her to go to bed so I can steal one pitiful moment of hollow ecstasy by the cold, blue light of my computer monitor.",Barney
We're showing Ted how lame he is.,Abby
"You don't have to say it, though.",Barney
"Uh, okay, Barney, you can stop.",Ted
"Stop what, Ted? Stop being in love? Next he'll ask us to stop breathing.",Barney
"We can't stop breathing, Ted. Your hair looks amazing.",Abby
"Um, Barney, I, I see what you're doing. Please stop.",Ted
"Not before I share with you what being in a relationship leads to, Ted. Abby, Pookie Bear... I am so pathetically desperate for you that... aw, heck, I'll just say it. Would you marry me?",Barney
"Wait, really?",Abby
I would never joke about true love.,Barney
"Yes, I'll marry you.",Abby
Okay.,Barney
"Thank you, thank you. I have to call my mom.",Abby
That's you.,Barney
"Uh, yeah, I don't think Abby knows you're kidding.",Ted
"Uh, yes, she does.",Barney
"It finally happened, Mama. I just wish Daddy were alive to walk me down the aisle.",Abby
Totally committed to the bit.,Barney
"Yes, Lily Aldrin. I sold you the painting earlier today.",Lily
You sound happy.,Lily
"Well, I just wanted to offer you an exclusive chance to view some of my other paintings.",Lily
What?,Lily
So... y-you didn't like my painting?,Lily
"Okay. Well, if you didn't want the painting, can I... can I at least get it back?",Lily
Where is it? I see. H-He threw out my painting.,Lily
"This is great. My dream of becoming an artist is dead, and now I'm watching my wardrobe disappear piece by piece. There goes my favorite dress. This dress meant a lot to me.",Lily
Really?,Robin
Yeah. It was spring of 2004 and I had been having a hard few months.,Lily
Da-amn.,Man
I got a two-syllable damn in this dress.,Lily
A two-syllable damn. That's the dream.,Robin
Yeah. Now she belongs to... CanadaGirlMetroNewsOne.com.,Lily
It's still in the family.,Robin
"Lily, you're not going to believe this. Something amazing happened.",Marshall
What?,Lily
I went to the G-CWOK's apartment.,Marshall
Really? Why?,Lily
Because I felt guilty. This auction was my idea and now you've had to sit around all day while a bunch of vultures ruthlessly pick apart the carcass of your wardrobe.,Marshall
It's still in the family.,Robin
"And more importantly, I honestly love that painting and I couldn't stand to think of it in a trashcan someplace.",Marshall
"Well, what happened?",Lily
"Hi, um... Lawrence. I-I'm here about the painting my wife Lily solyou-- the one in the nice frame.",Marshall
"Talk about a nice frame. My, my, you are a big one, aren't you? And you're married to that little bit of a thing. How does that work? I'd like to find out.",Lawrence
"Yeah, we get it. Gay guys like you.",Lily
"No, Lily, they love me, but that's not the important part.",Marshall
Here's the important part.,Ted
"Since you're clearly a man of impeccable taste and style, I-I came down here to ask you: what do you think of the boots?",Ted
Walter. Boots.,Lawrence
Pulling... Them.... Off.,Walter
I'll be in the cab.,Ted
G-CWOK-approved.,Ted
The painting!,Lily
"Right, so, um, they told me they threw it in the building's Dumpster.",Marshall
"It wasn't in there, but the super told me that he'd seen one Dr. Greer-- a veterinarian who works in the building-- take the painting out of the trash.",Marshall
Dr. Greer? Who's Dr. Greer a-and why did he take my painting?,Lily
You're about to find out.,Marshall
"Ooh, we don't need the details.",Lily
Really? Dogs like my paintings?,Lily
"Anyway, because your first painting worked so well, I convinced Dr. Greer to buy four more.",Marshall
Really?,Lily
"Mm-hmm, at $500 a piece.",Marshall
That's two grand. That's more than we need for the contractor.,Lily
"Yeah, but I was actually thinking we could reinvest it.",Marshall
In what?,Lily
In you.,Marshall
"Well, it's not exactly the clientele I had in mind, but... thank you for believing in me.",Lily
"Man, birds do not get you.",Marshall
"Hi, sweetie.",Abby
"Hey, I think I left my tie here. Have you seen it?",Barney
"No, I'm in wedding-planning mode. Stressville. Population: me. Okay, big decision. What do you think the cake should be: Fudgie the Whale or Cookie Puss?",Abby
"Yeah, that was a bit. We were doing a bit.",Barney
"So I'm thinking Labor Day. I was going to say Fourth of July, but I don't want to steal any attention away from America.",Abby
"Abby, I've... I've got some bad news. I can't marry you.",Barney
What?,Abby
Ted begged me not to. I think he's in love with you.,Barney
Really?,Abby
"Yes, our plan worked better than we ever dreamed. You have to go to him. Here's his home address. But you know what? He works late, so I wouldn't go before 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.",Barney
"Oh, my God, thank you. But now I feel wrong keeping this.",Abby
"Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that. That's made of candy. Later.",Barney
"Hey, go to lilyandmarshallselltheirstuff.com or charityfolks.com.",Marshall
We're having an auction to rise money for the children's hospital of Los Angeles,Lily
You could get tons of cool stuff on the sell and they all use for great cause.,Marshall
"Goliath National Bank. The world leader in credit and banking. God, I love Goliath National Bank!",Barney
"Okay, first of all, you look like the last pick in the draft. And, second, why are you so excited about some bank?",Ted
"Our company just bought them out in a ruthless takeover. Took two months. Cost 2,000 jobs. It was brutal. Who wants a T-shirt?  Hey, Marshall, they're hiring in the legal department. I could get you a job.",Barney
"Barney, Marshall didn't quit his last soul-sucking corporate job just to go work at a bank. He's gonna be an environmental lawyer.",Lily
"So, what do you guys want to do for dinner?",Ted
"Oh, we just got a new cook. You have to try the burger, it's amazing.",Wendy
"Great, we'll take five of those.",Robin
Really? You want to eat here?,Ted
"Yeah, I'm freaking starving. I just finished a seven-day cleanse.",Robin
I thought you started that yesterday.,Marshall
"I finished early, OK? ",Robin
Five burgers.,Wendy
Wait. What about sushi?,Ted
We had sushi last night.,Lily
Italian.,Barney
I had Italian for lunch.,Ted
I can come back.,Wendy
"No. We always do this. We spend an hour arguing about where to eat, and we end up here anyway. I haven't eaten for two days. Can we please, for the love of God, just order something now?",Robin
Chinese?,Ted
Oh.,Robin
I don't like Chinese.,Barney
Indian?,Ted
I just said I don't like Chinese.,Barney
Indian isn't Chinese.,Ted
"Weird meats, funny music, side of rice. Why are we splitting hairs?",Barney
Mexican?,Ted
I just said I don't like Chinese.,Barney
God.,Robin
"Robin, yours will be right out.",Wendy
"Of course, mine comes last. Go ahead, start without me.",Robin
Sweet! You shouldn't have. That's so kind of you.,Everybody
"My God. This burger is so good. It's like Christmas in my mouth, meat Christmas.",Lily
It's like an angel from heaven landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's. Where the chef k*ll it and ran it through the meat grinder.,Ted
"I love this burger so much, I want to sew my ass shut.",Barney
It's okay.,Marshall
Are you kidding me?,Everybody
"Guys, guys, guys. When you've had the best burger in NY, every other burger tastes like my grandpa's feet. But you guys eat up, enjoy my grandpa's feet.",Marshall
And you've had the best burger in New York?,Robin
"It was eight years ago, my first week in New York, and for a kid from Minnesota, the big city was a scary place.",Marshall
"Oh, thank God it's just you.",Marshall
You are being ridiculous. (,Ted
"Why would I have to leave? I can have anything I want delivered, and New York City cable is awesome. Have you seen this public access show with the old Jewish lady in a bikini? ",Marshall
"Marshall, you have to get over this paranoia. You are not gonna get mugged.",Ted
"What if I do, Ted. I don't have a switchblade. I don't know how to break-dance and win the begrudging respect of a street gang.",Marshall
"That's it, you're taking a walk. Come on, go.",Ted
"No. Look, the old lady in a bikini is back on. I'm just gonna lie back and get comfortable.",Marshall
"Go outside, go, go.",Ted
Okay. ,Marshall
Leave the bat.,Ted
Fine.,Marshall
"So I went for a walk in the big, scary city. And I discovered something amazing: it wasn't scary at all. All right. What's the word?",Marshal
"And then, right when I started to get a little hungry, I turned a corner...",Marshall
And there it was.,Marshall
Name two places where things get stuffed.,Barney
"So, I went inside.",Marshall
Thank you.,Marshal
"Ted, you got to wake up. Wake...",Marshall
"Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Are you okay?",Ted
"I'm all right. Ted, I've just had the most amazing burger of my life! It's this awesome little place, Regis Philbin eats there, so it's sort of like a celebrity hot spot. But the burger. The burger. Dude.",Marshall
I want one of those burgers right now! Do you think they're still open?,Ted
I don't know,Marshall
You couldn't find it?,Robin
We didn't know our way around. Just getting back to the apartment took us three hours and one very helpful drag queen.,Ted
"Wait, Penny Noir was a drag queen?",Marshall
Where do you think it was?,Robin
Probably tucked between her legs.,Lily
You know what's not a drag? Getting a home equity loan at Goliath National Bank. I'm just saying.,Barney
"Anyways, we never found the place. Now, eight years have passed, still... No burger.",Marshall
I couldn't help but overhear.,Man
"Okay, here we go.",Marshall
I know the place you're talking about.,Man
"No, you don't.",Marshall
It's a place called the Corner Bistro. Greatburger.,Man
"Oh, the Corner Bistro! It's amazing, I spent a quarter of my life searching for the best burger in New York City, but silly me, it never occurred to me to check the highest-rated burger in the Zagat guide. Wow, thanks a lot, guy. Let me return the favor. Great cup of coffee: Starbucks.",Marshall
So I take it you've tried the Corner Bistro.,Robin
"Robin, I've tried every so-called best burger in New York City trying to find that burger. Or at least forget about her.",Marshall
But none of those places even came close.,Marshall
"There was that one time we thought we had a break in the case, remember?",Ted
Get this. You know who works out at my gym? Regis Philbin.,Barney
"That's the one, Mr. Philbin. Do you remember where it is?",Marshall
No.,Marshall
"No. No, we don't know where it is.",Barney
"I don't know where it is, Regis, I swear!",Barney
"OK, Regis, we will, we will.",Barney
All right.,Barney
That's where my story ends. Now I'm doomed to walk the earth forever searching for that green door and that red neon sign that says Burger.,Marshall
"Green door, red neon sign that says Burger?",Robin
Yeah.,Marshall
"I know that place. I've walked by it a million times. It's on West 12th, right off of 7th.",Robin
I knew it was on a numbered street!,Marshall
Finally.,Robin
No...,Robin
I cannot believe we're finally gonna have this burger,Marshall
"Honey, I'm so excited for you. After all these interviews, after all these disappointments, you deserve a triumphant mouth full of meat.",Lily
"You know what else is a mouthful? All that double-talk other banks give you. At Goliath, customer satisfaction is our most important investment.",Barney
"Barney, I hate to break this to you, but working for a bank's kind of lame.",Lily
"How lame is free a*t*matic bill pay? How lame is 3.3% APY online savings? Yeah, that's right. Hate to make you look stupid in front of your friends, but you left me no choice. ",Barney
We should probably call Regis.,Ted
Reg... ,Barney
"Green door, red neon sign. Guys, this is the place. I've actually, I prepared a few words.",Marshall
Let's just go inside then. Shall we?,Marshall
Yours will be right out.,Waitress
"Please, go ahead, start.",Robin
Just shut up and eat.,Robin
All right.,Barney
Oh my god. I'm never brushing my teeth again unless it's with a toothbrush made from this burger.,Ted
I think I just had my first burg-asm.,Lily
"I want... to take this burger out to dinner, then maybe a movie, then take it back to my place, put on a little Terence Trent D'arby, and then I would just... fool around a little bit. Nothing serious, just take it slow, you know?",Barney
What?,Everybody
It's not it.,Marshall
"Marshall, you might not want to hear this, but... is it at all possible this is the same",Ted
"I mean, it is just a burger.",Robin
"Just a burger? It's so much more than just a burger. I mean, that first bite... Oh, what heaven that first bite is. The bun, like a sesame-freckled breast of an angel, resting gently on the ketchup and mustard below. Flavors mingling in a seductive pas de deux. And then... a pickle the most... playful... little pickle, and then a slice of tomato, a leaf of lettuce, and a... a patty... of ground beef, so... exquisite...swirling in your mouth, breaking apart and combining again in a fugue of sweets and savories so... delightful. This is no mere sandwich of grilled meat and toasted bread. This is God... speaking to us through food.",Marshall
And you got our wedding vows off the Internet.,Lily
"Okay, look, so, so this, this isn't the place. All right, it's no big deal. It's another place with a green door and a red neon sign that says Burger. I'll just... I'll call every restaurant in Manhattan and ask 'em what colour their door is. No big deal, right? Let's do this.",Marshall
I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this isn't just about a burger.,Robin
"Marshall's not doing so well, guys. He really needs to get a job.",Lily
Tell them about the underpants.,Ted
What about the underpants?,Robin
It started a couple of weeks ago.,Lily
Heads! It's going to be heads. It's almost usually heads.,Marshall
"Hey, baby.",Lily
Hey!,Marshall
Did you put on pants today?,Lily
Nope. ,Marshall
"It was funny at first, but then it became a daily thing. I thought, Okay, well, at least he's not leaving the house like that. Then, one day, he opened the door to get the paper. Day after that, went downstairs to get the mail.",Lily
"Everyone's got an underpants radius. For most of us, it's the distance from the bedroom to the bathroom, but as your self-esteem gets smaller, your underpants radius gets bigger.",Ted
How big is Marshall's underpants radius?,Robin
We're going.,Marshall
"Come on, Lily, he'll find a job eventually.",Ted
"You know, Lil, when times are tough, I like to remember the uplifting words of my favourite song. ",Barney
We've got to find Marshall that burger.,Lily
"Lily, I think we're all eating that burger.",Ted
I'm not eating that burger.,Robin
"No, if Marshall says this isn't the burger, this isn't it.",Lily
Finally.,Robin
"Excuse me. Did you guys change cooks or something? Because my husband was here 5 years ago, he's sure he had a different burger. ",Lily
"Yeah, we get this a lot. This place is modelled after this other place uptown with the same green door and Burger sign.",Waitress
What? Uptown? Where?,Ted
106th and Manhattan Avenue.,Waitress
Damn it.,Robin
106. A numbered street. Of course.,Marshall
Barney Stinson.,Barney
"I'm sorry, this is...?",Barney
"Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot to call you. That's not the place. The real place is on 106th and Manhattan Avenue. We're headed there right now.",Barney
Onions?,Barney
"Okay, no onions.",Barney
Stop the cab!,Marshall
Wait. This is it.,Marshall
This is it.,Marshall
"One of 9,000 convenient locations.",Barney
It was ri... it was right here. It was... it was right on this very spot.,Marshall
I don't understand. Where is the burger place?,Robin
It's not a burger place anymore; it's a Goliath National Bank ATM.,Ted
We can't eat here. It's an ATM.,Ted
But... food.,Robin
What the...,Barney
"This is your fault, you and your stupid bank. You did this.",Lily
"It's not my... Stop, okay. ",Barney
"I will never use a Goliath ATM ever again. Goliath National Bank sucks. It's the worst bank on the face of the earth. Attention, New Yorkers, this bank sucks! They suck!",Lily
"Marshall, Geez.",Barney
"They suck, suck!",Lily
Will you just tell her already?,Barney
Tell me what? Tell me what?,Lily
I got a job.,Marshall
What? Where?,Lily
"Goliath National Bank. That's why Barney's been going on and on about how, how great Goliath is. He wanted you to be excited for me since we will to working together.",Marshall
"Well, technically not together. You won't have access to my floor.",Barney
But you want to be an environmental lawyer.,Lily
"Yeah and I also want to be a Harlem Globetrotter and get paid in candy, but in the meantime, I need a job, and this is, this is a really good one. It's great pay and there's good benefits, and to be honest, it gives me a reason to put on pants in the morning. You know, I have my whole life to save the planet, but right now I'm kind of really excited to wear pants again.",Marshall
You've got great pants.,Lily
I love you.,Marshall
I love you.,Lily
"Robin, no!",Ted
They're unopened.,Robin
Give it.,Ted
They're barbecue.,Robin
Give it!,Ted
I'm sorry you didn't get your burger.,Lily
"It's stupid. I think about that first week in New York. You know? I was 22 years old. I had my whole future ahead of me. I guess I just kind of thought that if I could have that burger one more time and feel that way for one more night, that I might be able to check that off the list, and grow up, go work for the stupid bank, and just... be happy.",Marshall
"You know, that burger place isn't gone. It just moved to a new location. And I can tell you where that is for a hundred bucks.",Man
Let's pay the man.,Marshall
I paid for the cab.,Lily
I have any cash.,Ted
I haven't worked since March.,Marshall
"If only there were an easy, convenient way to get some cash right now.",Barney
Member FDIC.,Barney
Thank you.,Marshall
"All right, Marshall, remember. It might not taste as good. This place has changed, you've changed, New York has changed. Just... don't get your hopes up too high, okay?",Ted
This is it.,Marshall
Yes!,Everybody
"It's exactly the same. It's the best burger in New York. Go ahead, eat up, eat up.",Marshall
"I want to get tiny fitted sheets for this burger, and just... crawl into this bun, get all cosy, and die there.",Lily
"Oh, my God. I just want you inside of me.",Robin
This feels so good. I'm worried I'm gonna get this burger pregnant.,Barney
"If he does get that burger pregnant, I have dibs on the delicious burger babies.",Marshall
What? Come on.,Everybody
That's outrageous.,Barney
That is unbelievable. Wait. This is it!,Regis
You were just freakin' teasing us.,Marshall
"No, really.",Regis
"Well, I must go to Stella. Tonight is the big night. I tried before, I always failed. This time I will succeed. Tonight... I am a lesbian. Robin, your lipstick.",Barney
"Oh, no! Take pictures, okay?",Ted
"Hi, Ted.",Barney
"Oh, no!",Ted
"What's up, Ted?",Man
"Hi, Matisse.",Ted
Theodore!,Marshall
T-Diddy! You've missed that!,Barney
Robin has had the job of presenter.,Lily
And we have a free bottle of champagne.,Robin
But it's empty now.,Marshall
"Oh, no!",Ted
"Sorry, we could not wait. It cooled.",Stella
"Oh, no!",Ted
"Hey, big.",Lucy
"What's up, G?",Ted
Are you okay?,Stella
"Yeah, okay. It's just that... You know, I want to spend time with you, with my friends. I seem to spend my life on the train.",Ted
"Exactly, why not you invited your friends to come here?",Stella
It's a great idea.,Ted
"You want us to go in New Jersey? Oh, that's great.",Marshall
Why?,Ted
"First, I no longer have my gold medallions. I sold them when they are out of date, 400 years ago.",Barney
Lily?,Ted
"I'm sorry, Ted. I am a New Yorker pure juice. I am programmed to despise and hate New Jersey and all it represents. Why I say that? You hate him more than anyone.",Lily
What? I love New Jersey. Why you say that?,Ted
"And then he walks past me. I hate you not respect the queue more than New Jersey. In fact, this is false. There's nothing I hate more than New Jersey.",Ted
"Great, huh?",Ted
It's waiting for you?,Marshall
"No, it'll take a while. I have to drop a massive New Jersey.",Ted
"So New Jersey is not my favorite place. But when we get married, and they have moved in with me, I will never stay there. Unless I see the Giants and I evacuated New York or I get rid of a body.",Ted
"Ted, if you m*rder me and bury me in New Jersey, I'll haunt thee for ever.",Lily
And if I assassinate and bury you somewhere else?,Ted
I'll leave you alone. I'm sure you had your reasons.,Lily
"I am Robin Scherbatsky, and you look...  Etro New One to 23h.  And again at 1am.",Robin
So hurry up and vote for the cutest dog in New York.,Robin
"Four workers were electrocuted when a subway train derailed. Stay here for more... de-rail shocking. Joel, people died.",Robin
"Tonight is my last issue. I arrived in Metro New One as a small caterpillar. And for 4 years, this office was my cocoon.But tonight, I turned into a butterfly ambitious.",Robin
Why it looks silly? She had a stroke?,Marshall
"Yeah, a stroke of genius. This speech is really good.",Ted
"With an eye on the horizon, a look at the truth, and an eye on you all.",Robin
"It's you who wrote, right?",Lily
This is a modified version of one I did when I left the swim team because of an ear problem.,Ted
You wore towels.,Marshall
It's part of the team.,Ted
"Stella has not found a babysitter, you're stuck. Instead, we'll all stay here and it'll be awesome.",Ted
"Well, there are games, there are movies. And there shall be beer in the garage.",Stella
"It's pathetic. It's Saturday night. We should get drunk in a bar. I know this sounds depressing, almost tragic, but it is a fact.",Marshall
"Yeah, and I want another drink for this girl, Doris. I know I can ask this aircraft lesbian.",Barney
No snakes on that plane.,Marshall
"Come on guys, you promised. We stay there and we try to have fun. We're all here. Being with friends. It's not that the primary?",Ted
"With the next train, you can be in McClaren's to 23h.",Lily
You can be at 22h.,Barney
"No, I have to change. I'm not feeling in New Jersey.",Lily
You really hate this part.,Stella
What? No!,Marshall
"No, I understand, you're New Yorkers, you need a bar.You could go to the coolest bar in the state, which is so close that you will not believe it.  and bang, here. The coolest bar in New Jersey.",Stella
"Yeah, probably.",Lily
That's great! We have darts. A half ping-pong. An aquarium. Look how it's getting a great night as planned. One could make the bait and watch them fight.,Ted
No thank you. I play not with aquariums unless they are my two favorite animals: the pilot fish and torturlute. Did you see!,Barney
For torturlute? You're right.,Ted
Marshall.,Barney
You deserve better than that.,Marshall
Lily.,Barney
Not good enough.,Lily
Stella.,Barney
Sorry.,Stella
"I fall not rest until we not make me respect for another person's knuckles brushing against mine so sweet, but manly.Small, small... Small, small... Small... Who's the baby? Know that as long as it does not have what he wants. No, deserves.This fist will not waver. It... bow... not.",Barney
Who wants to play Scrabble?,Stella
"Yes, why not.",Lily
"Look, the letter X is a bit difficult to read because a few years ago, she walked into my dog. You know, we should get a dog when you come to live here.",Stella
When I what?,Ted
Super. This is Robin.,Stella
I thought they came to live with you.,Lily
"Me too. My God, I moved to New Jersey?",Ted
"Guys, I'm sure the dog had to soaring after swallowing the tablet X. Too good! Go!",Barney
I can not live here.,Ted
"It's not so bad. You can put a mini fridge, there, and perhaps an air hockey.",Marshall
Air Hockey. Well done my fat.,Barney
"I speak of New Jersey in general, not the basement. She wants me moved? I do not get it. It was discussed there for months.",Ted
"I thought that after marriage, Lucy and you could sit here.",Ted
"Yeah, it could play in the fire escape, be friend with the guy who sleeps on a couch in the driveway, biking on Broadway. Great idea, Ted.",Stella
I understand why they want to live in New Jersey when you can live in Manhattan? I thought my apartment was one of his reasons for marrying me.,Ted
"Seriously, I thought it was the only one. Too much! You're glowing. Tape the Barnacle.",Barney
Stella has already warned me.,Robin
"So, your first day?",Marshall
It was not.,Robin
What?,All
"It was not my first day. I arrived and there were 20 people. In fact, I have not really got the job. I just had an interview.",Robin
How so?,Barney
I know. He told me that I had had it.,Robin
I got it? I got it!,Robin
"Let's be clear, when I say you, I mean the interview.You have the interview. I do not want there to be confusion.You only maintenance. Not the job.",Voice
Thank you! Thank you!,Robin
I'll call and beg Joel for giving me my job.,Robin
No!,Marshall
You hate that job.,Lily
It was not so bad.,Robin
How they made you call the Hurricane Hector when he was pouring with rain?,Lily
A cycorde.,Robin
You're in the eye of cycorde.,Marshall
Thank you.,Ted
Naughty.,Barney
"That sucks, but I can do what? I will not have another job. You would have seen other women in the interview. They were all more experienced, more ethnic. There was a black girl with blue eyes. How can I compete?",Robin
You can not.,Barney
"You can compete with anyone. You're Robin Scherbatsky. Confident, strong, great. With super long legs that look great in shorts.",Lily
I called Joel.,Robin
"If you call now, you'll regret it. I slept with me full of women who were then sent to graze and then decamped. And sometimes they take the phone and they call me and do it again. And when we finished, I see that look on their faces, that look that says they hate themselves and they would never have known. But if you could see this look... In fact, you can see that look, there is a video, http://www...",Barney
Come on. I will not call.,Robin
This is the look.,Barney
I can not live here. I hate being here. I would k*ll myself.,Ted
"New Jersey is not so bad. Stella has a lawn. You can have a lawn mower. They sell there. I've seen with a cup holder. I saw a deck chair with a cup holder. I even saw a hammock with a cup holder. You live in New Jersey, you will not have to hold a cup.",Marshall
"It asks me no problem holding a cup, unlike you.",Ted
I'll give you $ 100 for hitting my fist. $ 200.,Barney
"Drop it, Barney. Your arm should make you suffer.",Lily
$ 10 000.,Barney
You'll be on the other side of the river. You'll be in New York all the time.,Marshall
I'm sorry. You are in New York?,Ted
We lived in Manhattan.,Woman
Are you in town?,Ted
All the time.,Woman
You see? All the time.,Marshall
When was the last time?,Ted
We dined with O'Rourke.,Man
It's been closed for six years.,Ted
"It's been a while. Funny, not that we lack.",Woman
"I guess is the New Jersey-vegans, now. Honey, look, T-shirt with dogs.",Man
I can not do that. I'll tell Stella she and Lucy are coming to town and that's it.,Ted
"What do you think guys? Beagle, or Boston terrier?",Marshall
It's the tears?,Lily
They are magnificent... manly tears of pain. They are not emotional. They are a little emotional.,Barney
Where is Robin?,Lily
"Shirley, this is Robin. I called Joel.",Robin
"Robin, hangs up. Do not do that.",Barney
"Sorry, I know, OK?",Robin
If you hang up no...,Lily
"Stop! Joel, this is Robin.",Robin
"So, Ms. Papillon wants to return to his cocoon.",Joel
I'm sorry for saying all this stuff.,Robin
"You can put your socks with your apology, for you have already been replaced. Brian is the makeup and it could not be more excited.",Joel
I can not do that. I can not do that.,Biran
"Look, although I want to see what college is over for the camera, if you can be here for the 23h, you can get your job.",Joel
"Ok, I have half an hour to arrive at the studio.",Robin
You can never be in town in 30 minutes.,Lily
"Do not do it. It's scary to bet on itself, if you do not, nobody will. I'm not saying that to pat my fist. Even if a punch would be great. I mean it.",Barney
I bet on me. I bet I can be there for 23h.,Robin
You got the beer?,Stella
"Yeah, I took a pack of 144. The rest is in the trunk.",Ted
And you registered?,Stella
No.,Ted
Why?,Stella
"Was in line for the pictures, my hair is in the air... I want to live in New Jersey.",Ted
What?,Stella
I can not. And I see no reason that you did not come to New York.,Ted
"My daughter goes to school here. All his friends are here. I have lived here all my life. My whole family is here. This is my house. I'm at the EPA. And since June 1, I am the deputy mayor.",Stella
"Yes, but my apartment is close to the Metro.",Ted
"It moves not, end of discussion.",Stella
How does it end of discussion? It never was.,Ted
That's what being a parent. I want to uproot Lucy.,Stella
People with kids are moving all the time. It would be great for Lucy to grow up in the largest city in the world.,Ted
It is. New York is the largest city in the world. Where the dream come true and of pigeon shit tastes like tapioca. Want a little secret? New Jersey... is better than New York.,Stella
Better than...? You think...? I... The Empire State Buil...H and H Bage... The center Linco... Zabar's... Papaya King.New York is the cultural and intellectual center of the planet.,Ted
"New York is full of crazies, snobs and bad people. You know that once an old woman called me a slut and gave me a cat in his face? And you want to know if it's the same in New Jersey? 86th and Lex, right in front of your dear little Papaya King. The people of New Jersey are nice. This is the kind of place where you know your neighbors.",Stella
"Hey, I know my neighbors!",Ted
"Yes, that kind?",Stella
"At the other end of the hall, there is... Clax... pa... I.",Ted
Claxpamon?,Stella
It is called Paxton.,Lily
I love this guy.,Ted
"Sorry, I'm in a hurry. I go to before I go down first.",Robin
Do not spill Matisse.,Matisse
"Ok, this is crazy. You can not believe that New Jersey is better than New York. In New York, there was Broadway. No need to say more.",Lily
"Oh, yes. Tape for safety.",Barney
It was Atlantic City.,Stella
You can not b*at A.C. Pity! Nobody needs to know.,Barney
New York has Greenwich Village.,Ted
New Jersey coast.,Stella
Chronicles of the Oscar-winning on urban neurotic.Tape!,Barney
Bruce Springsteen.,Stella
Sinatra.,Ted
It's in Hoboken... New Jersey.,Stella
"But that city he sings? This is not Secaucus, Secaucus.",Ted
"Look, Stella, I understand that coming from New Jersey, you think not to like New York, but believe me, Marshall did not believe it either, and now he would move for anything.",Lily
"I hate New York! Sorry, but it's true. Today, I passed PriceCo. You've already been? It's huge. The New York stores are cramped. When I turn, I spill something. I'm like a big monster out of the ocean to destroy bodegas.",Marshall
"but, Marshall, you love New York.",Lily
"Yes, except I hate it. I'm too big for New York! I try to hold seats in the cramped subway or stoop under doors over 150 years. People are taller, have larger doors. What is your problem?",Marshall
"Small town, big men, then tope.",Barney
"It is too noisy, all the time. Yes, it is the city that never sleeps. Well, I would sleep well. I'm tired for 8 years. Tired and scared, with black and blue marks on my elbows to try to keep between the gateway for elves. New Jersey's great. There are department stores, and lawn and you do not have to wear a cup. For the rest of your life. I'm not afraid to say so. I love New Jersey. Just kidding.",Marshall
"I understand, OK? I see what you mean. I guess... we could live in Brooklyn.",Ted
"You know what, Ted... Live wherever you want. I do not care.",Stella
Silence embarrassed. Tope then.,Barney
"Hey, Lucy. What are you doing up?",Ted
There was noise in the cellar.,Lucy
Sorry. Go back to sleep.,Ted
I can not sleep without a story.,Lucy
"Ok, I'll get your mom...",Ted
Why do you not read me one?,Lucy
Let's go.,Ted
I moved here.,Ted
Really?,Stella
Really. New Jersey wins.,Ted
"Oh, thank you! Wait. Good evening, New York.",Robin
"Look, it did.",Barney
"Our story tonight, the baby panda at the zoo in Central Park made his first tooth today. I think that makes him a... Bear molar. Bear molar. Bear molar. You know what? It's really over for me. Good night, New York.",Robin
It really stops.,Lily
You think you're there for something?,Barney
"I think so. Good job, Barney.",Lily
"Oh, my God! Thank you! Oh, I k*ll my arm. My arm has never been so sore since I was 13 the day I knew how to close the bathroom. Cool!",Barney
What's the matter?,Lily
I have not officially got the job.,Robin
I'm sorry.,Lily
It's OK. They offer me another.,Robin
It's great. This is for what?,Ted
Foreign Correspondent. I... moved to Japan.,Robin
Barney's crazy if he thinks it'll work.,Robin
I think it'll work.,Marshall
I hope not.,Lily
There he is.,Ted
Excuse me?,Woman
From the future?,Cindy
What are you doing?,Ted
"In a few minutes, the young me your time will enter through this door. I know it sounds crazy, but to save the planet, you have to sleep with him tonight.",Barney
What? I...,Cindy
You mean what?,Cindy
"Well, the movers arrive in 14 hours. We have to go back to finish the boxes.",Lily
You have not finished? Why is it so long?,Robin
The best memories of our 20 years were held in it. It's not that throw stuff in a box. You look back at the past.,Ted
Not me. The key? Discard tips and not looking back. I go to Japan. It took me half an hour.,Robin
A half hour?,Lily
"I could take 20 minutes, but a friend called me in tears.",Robin
Moving is very moving.,Marshall
"But it is. Finally, everything changes. I will live with Stella, you will be in your new apartment. You start a new job in Tokyo. This is the end of an era. We should make a toast, but not with the usual shit. Your bottle of Scotch the most expensive.",Ted
"This is a Glen McKenna 50 years, and it is $ 2 500.",Wendy
"Excellent. A bottle of beer with it, and what do you think will cancel the Scotch?",Ted
Vive la vodka.,Barney
It will not work.,Robin
"My God, you are... ho, my God! I offer you a drink?",Cindy
"I guess I have time for a drink and 45 minutes to an hour for other activities, but after that, I must return to the top secret research project I'm working on.",Barney
Global warming?,Cindy
My God! How do you know that?,Barney
Look at this. A photo of the day we moved. So many good memories.,Ted
"Well, that's exactly the kind of crap to throw away.",Robin
So you keep a photograph?,Ted
"It's like love letters, directories or the ashes of people.They take up space. In addition, she will let you not keep half your mess.",Robin
Why not?,Ted
"Oh, dear. That's what the guys know that after moving in with a woman. All your stuff are idiots.",Lily
Like what?,Ted
Like everything else you bought the medieval festivals.,Lily
There is not enough drinks in the world that I drop my scourge.,Ted
"As you will not get bail, I thought you could pay me half.",Marshall
"Wait, why I pay more?",Ted
Because you've treated this apart as John Bonham treated his nervous system.,Marshall
That's not true.,Ted
Proof A.,Marshall
What is it?,Marshall
An Encyclopedia World Book of 1986. It is with these that I grew up.,Ted
Encyclopedia?,Marshall
"Do you think we should say-die encyclo-pil. It's a common mistake. But if you look at the direction of the bar on the e. The symbol of this encyclopedia, you'll know it is a diacritic which aims to change...",Ted
"You know, it'll have you dia-pays for it.",Marshall
"But you've ever done. Second, the evidence B.",Marshall
"Hello, good topics. Look what I won at the festival.",Ted
You're also responsible for damage to Robin when she was your girlfriend.,Marshall
What damage did I do?,Robin
Do you remember the time you got drunk the pack of beer and you've become Super Canadian?,Marshall
Stanley Cup game six? The Rangers will regret having met with the Canucks.,Robin
$ 20 if you manage to run it through the door.,Marshall
You're more amazing than a Tim Hortons donut. Timmy Ho!,Robin
"I'll give you the teeth of happiness. A little here, a little there.",Robin
Give me the stick.,Lily
"Get out, bouseuse.",Robin
Let's go!,Lily
"Catch it, guys!",Ted
I'll break!,Robin
"Girls, stop!",Ted
For America.,Marshall
It's good enough!,Ted
It does not stop a fight between girls! Ever!,Barney
"Barney's fault entirely. As fat burning on the mantelpiece, for that matter.",Ted
What's going on?,Stewart
This is an intervention.,Man
"Alcohol has changed you, Stewart. We recognize you more. And I love the man I married.",Women
Thank you. This is the boost I need. I love you all.,Stewart
This is the man of the evening. It's time to let the monster out of his cage!,Barney
No.,Stewart
"Come on, man. People want to see Bruce Banner.They want Hulk. What?",Barney
I'm really proud that we have helped Stewart.,Robin
"Yes, what a moment of incredible human sincerity.",Lily
It's true. We live.,Marshall
You're going to seriously continue to wear this hat?,Barney
"Yes, it's been two weeks.",Lily
"Two wonderful weeks... and oh yes, I will continue to wear it.",Marshall
This is an intervention.,Lily
About the hat.,Ted
I control. I can remove it whenever I want.,Marshall
"Dear Marshall, I do not like that stupid hat. I want to cut with a scythe. Or, cut the chisel, for you looks like a real jerk. ",Robin
Oh my God. This is one of p'tain of pleasant surprise. This is about what?,Lily
This is about the exaggerated English accent.,Ted
P'tain.,Lily
"Self Tanner? They entice you with a coupon, and after it becomes addictive.",Robin
"We know, darling, you know. This is a brand new vest.",Lily
What?,Barney
The magic tricks.,Robin
"Specifically, those with fire.",Lily
"The magic tricks? Guys, interventions are meant to help people, not to address every aspect you do not like.Sorry, but it warms me. It makes me boil! I mean, I am filled with a burning rage!  Thanks! Oh, shit.",Barney
It smells like hair!,Lily
"It's weird. By removing the closet, I thought I saw the banner.",Ted
And?,Marshall
"And the flag was b*rned. Why new? And there are letters from you all, with Ted written on it. You prepare a response for me?",Ted
"Well, that was stupid. Yes, forget it.",Lily
That was why? The sandals? Hair products?,Ted
No Stella.,Marshall
"My God, it was for Stella.",Ted
I just said No Stella. It was perhaps for your hearing problems.,Marshall
What?,Ted
It's getting serious. You see?,Marshall
You think I should not marry Stella. You think I should not marry.,Ted
We want him. We are all really happy for you.,Marshall
"Like I said, it was stupid.",Lily
"Obviously, it was not, it had agreed to make interventions more stupid to work on interventions.",Ted
We made too many interventions.,Ted
What was your biggest problem with me and Stella?,Ted
Stella.,Ted
I can not remain indifferent... ,Barney
You kept it on you?,Ted
"Please. I can not remain impassive while you make the biggest mistake a man can do... get married. Keep my words, it will all part... Flames! Oh, shit! I sent the flame too soon. I had so many important things to say, and... The fact is, Ted, marriage is stupid. Each year there are a million girls aged 22, sexy, who go to bars and call me, glass half full, but I think they become beasts.",Barney
"Even you, you will meet more girls in 22 years when you get 80.",Marshall
I meet this challenge.,Barney
What challenge?,Marshall
Prove that I will be just as great at 80. I'll go out with a girl of 22 years with my old man makeup.,Barney
"I did not challenge. I would love to see it, but I've not challenged.",Marshall
I want to hear the other letters.,Ted
This is ridiculous. It changed his mind.,Lily
"And if you changed yet? Go Lily, listen to yours.",Ted
The capabilities of Gilbert reading have improved considerably... This is a letter I had to give one of my students.,Lily
Things go too fast between you and a girl named Stella?,Woman
I'd like.,Boy
I can hear yours?,Ted
"Dear Ted, it's encyclo-pe-die, not encyclo-pil-die. Why you always want to say things so pretentious? Looks like a moron, and it's cr-e-tin and non-cr-ay-tin. ",Robin
You've already read the intervention on my pronunciation. Where is the letter of Stella?,Ted
"I have not written. I am your ex. I told myself that everything I say is offensive. In addition, I am sexier it, so who cares?",Robin
Water has flowed under the bridge...,Marshall
Come on.,Ted
"Dear Ted, Stella seems to be wonderful. But you do not know enough to get married. You do not know probably not enough to get involved in raising a child with her. You do not restore her service or her child or yourself by throwing yourself like that. Just take a little longer.  It was there for months, OK?That was before we know Stella and that way as she's great and what you train super torque. That's why we decided to not make this statement.",Marshall
Thank you. Because I really need you to handle it.,Ted
And we're here.,Marshall
And we hope you're not sorry.,Robin
Of course not. It's not like what you said was nonsense.You you were worried.,Ted
But concerns that a completely expelled.,Lily
But you score a point. It all happened very quickly.,Ted
"You know what? This may be because... when it's good, you know.",Marshall
"I guess, but we are still at the stage where one seeks to know himself. And Lily, you may be right. Stella will not like my stuff. As the robot pot cake. This is the first thing we bought here, remember?",Ted
Of course it does. My sensors indicate that your shortbread levels are dangerously low.,Marshall
"My collection of James Bond. You know, we looked at them in order, and... Lily spoke with this weird English accent, until the next month?",Ted
It was sophisticated.,Lily
My cleats signed by Bernie Kosar. My lamp elephant.The English phone booth. My sombrero!,Ted
What are you doing?,Robin
I unpack. I never leave this apartment.,Ted
"Ted, stop unpacking. You're in the process of pinball.",Lily
"I'm not ready for this responsibility, let alone to be the stepfather of a 7 year old daughter. If I get married and moved to the suburbs, in a twinkling, I exchange old!",Ted
You're cute. How old are you?,Woman
83 years. How old are you?,Barney
31 years.,Female
Ted going bonkers. The movers arrive in 10 hours. His bride awaits in New Jersey. We must do something.,Lily
"I'm on it. Hey, man?",Marshall
Hey.,Ted
Come here a minute.,Marshall
What?,Ted
"Know that this is quite normal. The major change can be frightening, and fear... it is one of them. So... why not you give me the kn*fe? Give it to me. Go. That way I can unpack too. I will stay with you forever! We had a nice life here.That's why we rejected the package. Because unconsciously, we all know that it would be stupid to leave. It's safe and warm here. There is a downstairs bar, a robot cookie in the kitchen.This is my house and I never leave!",Marshall
"Listen up! You sound like that big beta colo. Mom, Dad, I want to go. Cool boys play hide and seek with my inhaler. ",Robin
I can not believe my father had read this letter at our wedding.,Marshall
"You can not do that to Lily. Your new apartment a few problems with the floor not right and the sewage treatment plant next door, but you will make a great home. Tell her, Lily.",Robin
"This is the black hole where dreams go to die. I move it, either.",Lily
Come on.,Robin
"Guys, finish unpacking. I will bake cookies to fill R2-plump.",Lily
"My God, what a band of cowards! Frightened by the slightest change. Terrified by all that is new. Desperate to cling to your comfort zone. I can not go to Japan. What was I thinking? It's so far. I speak the language. I have not even good pictures of you.",Robin
"Oh, honey.",Lily
"Everybody says it's good to change, right? But it's what's good?",Marshall
"Who wants to go to the same old bar, sit at the same place and drink the same thing? The same thing! My favorite!",Ted
"Oh, my God!",Ted
I think someone owes me $ 200.,Barney
"Barney, it was not a gamble. Person...",Marshall
I am moving to New Jersey.,Ted
What?,Lily
"And you should move into the new apartment, and Robin should go to Japan.",Ted
Why?,Robin
"Because it will age like it or not, then the real question is: do we want to go forward or clinging desperately to the past and end up like that?",Ted
"Take me with you, darling. I want to see your medals from World w*r II.",Woman
"Okay, it matters not.",Marshall
"It is French, it's like playing tennis without a net.",Robin
"You know what? I take care of the warranty. It makes me happy, because every hole in this apartment is a memory I will never forget. But on one condition: you put all 10 tickets aside every week for next year and come back here and buy this tape 50 years of age, and a toast to the incredible year full of change that we had it. Remove from us. My new family and I, Marshall and Lily, in their apartment and Robin in a number of English-language journalists in the West Pacific, ending up here in New York to celebrate this day... The day we closed one chapter of our lives incredibly, to open a new one.",Ted
I had to leave my laptop...,Woman
Remove from here.,Ted
"So, let's raise our glasses of scotch at $ 2 500 for a year of hell.",Ted
Amazing.,Robin
It's amazing.,Barney
"It's smoky, with hints of cedar and old... You see the difference between that and tape for $ 10?",Ted
Not at all.,Marshall
I would much Red Bull.,Barney
"Wendy, you can take a picture?",Robin
So if we continued the evening up there?,Lily
Yeah.,Marshall
Good idea. I have the tape.,Ted
Barney is an intervention.,Robin
"That's enough, the trick of old.",Marshall
Forget it.,Lily
I will get my problem.,Ted
You're going to get my boat?,Barney
Hi.,Ted
Hi. How are you?,Lily
It was just dinner with her sister Stella and her boyfriend.They married before us.,Ted
"You know, you dream of the perfect wedding since you been little girl.",Stella
Yeah.,Lily
Bluntly.,Marshall
"My sister steals my dream wedding. So every little detail on Shelter Island, the sun managed to sleep...",Stella
It seems that the lamb is great here.,Ted
"I'm vegan. I wish I could silence that voice in me that says eating animals is m*rder, but I guess I'm not as strong as you.",Nora
Did you need protein. I take the lamb.,Ted
"New objective: Our marriage is to kick the ass of hers.Our marriage is to take the head of his, press it down the toilet and flush 20 times.",Ted
"Ted, in high school, his marriage was you, right?",Lily
"You know, she always wants to overtake. I like it, but there is a part of me that would like it all falls apart.",Stella
"I hate it! I hate him. God, this steak is good. 4 days before and he fled with a consultant from Whole Foods? I do my make-up more for him. I do not shower more for him. I shave armpits more for him.",Nora
Hard to know where is the problem.,Ted
"Now, so close to the wedding... Got some bacon or something in the sauce. I love it. I would not be refunded. I will lose thousands of dollars.",Nora
You think about what? It might help.,Stella
"No, Stella, it should help. Pay for dinner. Do not worry.Taking Charge.",Ted
"It's true. Recovering your marriage, we reimburse you all that you paid for. Ted and I are getting married Sunday.",Stella
We get married on Sunday? It is sure to be ready for this?,Ted
"I've wasted years waiting for the father of Lucy decides to be ready for it, but it has ever been. That's why we had never married. Come on, must be spontaneous, I dreamed that Tony is spontaneous like that.",Stella
I'm leaving. And I'm also... spontaneous.  I would not have done that.,Ted
"We need you to come, this is my marriage.",Ted
"I can not. I am in Tokyo. This is my first week. I can not leave like this. In addition, I am finally serious information.",Robin
The board of the Fed voted not to change the... rates.,Robin
This is my marriage. You gotta be there.,Ted
"OK, I'll be there. I gotta go. Good evening. And I'm Robin Scherbatsky. The talks have been arrested in the Middle East. Despite a promising start in the final negotiations, the talks foundered on security.",Robin
It is.,Ted
"Okay, burial of bachelorhood. Tonight, I have three exotic dancers most flexible physically and mentally that you've ever seen...",Barney
No time.,Ted
I'll tell you.,Barney
Do we really have to rent the cars for tomorrow.,Ted
What?,Barney
"No You not married, Ted? No You're making a big mistake, Ted? Have you stopped the fight against marriage?",Lily
"No, I recognize a lost cause, when I see it. That's why I'm not recycle. In addition, Ted getting married, it is my interest. You know...",Barney
"I worked on an issue of utmost importance. I admit I was baffled. Until I decided to take the bull by the horns. Then, finally, I d√©cryptais code. GIVE THE MARRIAGE OF TED. ",Barney
So you come back to Robin.,Lily
Let's hope. This weekend is my best chance to start with it.,Barney
"You'll never there. Too many opportunities. The first bridesmaid drunk, you'll have your head under the dress as a photographer of yesteryear.",Lily
"Lily, kidding. I want to look cutesy and romantic, but this weekend, Robin will be the only girl that I will draw.",Barney
It's not really the place I imagined for the wedding of Ted.,Lily
The Collective Namaste Yoga and Meditation.,Barney
"I know about you, but I will not namaster here too long.",Marshall
"Honey, will see the dirty hippie to the reservation there, we, we'll take to drink.",Lily
You have anything like Scotch?,Barney
"In the center, we have a strict anti-alcohol.",Bartender
"Super, meals included, right?",Marshall
"Yes, and they are all 100% vegan.",Woman
"I need alcohol. I'm not gonna do that stuff with Robin.Look at that. Berry cocktail, conditioner meninges. I dream, these drinks could make a girl smarter. What hell Ted brought us?",Barney
There's no meat.,Marshall
There's no alcohol.,Lily
"Even worse, I'm 90% sure that this kind in which you spoke was the lead singer of Spin Doctors.",Marshall
"Guys, Stella and I have a little problem.",Ted
"The programs are great. It is not our names on it, but otherwise it looks nice.",Stella
"Actually, I spoke to Robin. It is a little late, but it will be there on time.",Ted
You're invited Robin?,Stella
"Yes, of course.",Ted
You gave me no warning. I'm not sure what to think.,Stella
Can I help you? Are you happy. You like him.,Ted
"Yes, but it's your ex girlfriend. It's weird.",Stella
But no.,Ted
It's weird. Not what you imagine is to see her boyfriend's ex marriage.,Stella
Your new husband dismounted me out three times a day.,Robin
"When the former are present, I dunno, it brings back...things unresolved. Close with your ex, do you know that the flame will not turn back?",Stella
"Come on, we're friends. In addition, we already had our Thanksgiving last relapse, it is not old.",Ted
Have you bet money against you in this quarrel?,Stella
She already has his ticket.,Ted
It's important to me. I would have never invited the father of Lucy.,Stella
It would not bother me. Tony is great. Invite him too.,Ted
"No, Tony is the last person I want to see here, OK? And Robin is the penultimate.",Stella
"Robin will soon get on the plane. In addition, it unleashed a lot of work for that.",Ted
"Driven by concerns about the environment and oil prices, sales of hybrid vehicles rose 11% over last year.",Robin
What should I do?,Ted
I know. I understand something is no ex. Why would we want that history failed to come see one successful?It's like inviting the Seattle Mariners World Series. It's embarrassing for everyone.,Marshall
What? No. Robin must come.,Barney
"That's true, this is my best friend. Girl friend. My best friend girl.",Ted
"I do not care, why do such.",Lily
"Dude, Robin has to be there.",Barney
It should not come.,Marshall
What are you parl...,Barney
"Aldrin Justice, the last word.",Ted
"OK, this would be weird without Robin. But not contradict the bride.",Lily
I will not tell him to come.,Ted
It's the right decision.,Marshall
It's gonna be the worst phone call of all time.,Ted
"Co-witness, I'll handle this.",Barney
Hello?,Robin
"Robin, where are you?",Barney
I'm off to the airport.,Robin
"OK, in a few hours. Have a good flight. Bad news. I can not have it. Robin is gone.",Barney
"OK, Robin arrives. You know, I'm fine. The former should be able to go to weddings. I'll tell Stella to do with.",Ted
You should be more delicate with Stella about Robin.,Lily
What do you mean by delicate?,Ted
"The brides are very stressed before a wedding. Well, of course, I was under control.",Lily
Do not you remember?,Marshall
The florist told me that roses are medium pink pale pink that means. Medium pink pale! All're done. Our wedding hall uses a boiler instead of a forced air heating. This is the thing that concerned me. Why are we still married?,Lily
"After a while, is that the waffle.",Marshall
Poor Stella must be the crazy one month in three days.,Lily
What do I do?,Ted
"You wait for the next crisis, the rules you, you're a hero.After, you dealt with on about Robin, but this time she will say yes.",Lily
And if there is no other crises?,Ted
This is a bride. There will be another crisis.,Lily
There is a new crisis.,Ted
Great! What is it?,Lily
"My daughter, my daughter does not come to our wedding.",Stella
What?,Ted
"Tony was the lead here tomorrow, but cash hurt my marriage, and he will not take him. It's been 5 years. Why not turn the page?",Stella
"So, first thing tomorrow I'm going to talk to him, convince him to let me take Lucy, then boom, crisis solved. Stella is happy. Robin comes to marriage.",Ted
You are Barney?,Nora
Yes.,Barney
"I heard you were a real bastard, so listen. Tomorrow night, I want to do things so nasty and depraved that I forget that it was supposed to be my wedding.",Nora
I'm here with someone.,Barney
Bring her.,Nora
You'll never get there.,Lily
We did a little karate?,Ted
"Sorry, sorry dude. You have my alarm activated defense. You must remember these things. Stay alert, rest life.",Tony
OK.,Ted
What brings you here? I thought you'd be in a bridal suite with my wife.,Tony
Not yet. Soon.,Ted
"That's right, tonight is the big night. Oh, man, you gonna make love to the mother of my daughter.",Tony
"Actually, I've already had sex many times. Why I always corrects people?",Ted
You and Stella. You're lucky. I could just... I am very happy for you.,Tony
"Look, here's the thing...",Ted
You can not take it.,Tony
"Tony, stop. It is also a great day for Lucy. You'll have to put your problems aside and think about what is best for her.Whether you like it or not, it really should be the wedding of his mother. I take Lucy with me.",Ted
"You're right, man. You're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just... You see all... made me realize what I had.",Tony
Let's cuddle.,Ted
"I'm sorry. Lucy is everything to me. I will lose it with this family, I am not one.",Tony
But you're part of.,Ted
I have not been invited to the wedding.,Tony
You are now.,Ted
"Road Trip OK?  Road Trip 2, back in the car.",Tony
This is the big day. You hydrate?,Nora
"Dear wife, thank you for the interest you have for Barney Stinson...",Barney
Your back will look like a Jackson Pollock.,Nora
I regret to inform you that at this time...,Barney
I have been vegan for 2 years. I need meat.,Nora
There are currently no positions available.,Barney
I am a teacher of Yoga. All positions are possible. Your room in 20 minutes. No preliminary.,Nora
"I will not do, huh?",Barney
No chance.,Lily
Let me talk to Stella first.,Ted
Mom! Ted invited Dad!,Lucy
"Hi, my heart. You've missed. Just one second, OK?Tony invited you? At our wedding? This was discussed. No ex at our wedding. Why did you do that?",Stella
What did Ted this time?,Robin
What does Robin here? I thought I was clear. No ex at our wedding.,Stella
To be fair... your ex is here.,Ted
You've invited!,Stella
"Come on, it's not weird.",Ted
"It's weird. It is as if it was not over between you. Tony and... I can not look after him. Will you tell him to leave? You can say it's my fault. I'll talk to Robin, she knows it's not personal.",Stella
I understand.,Robin
I get it.,Tony
"For the first time, Ted and Stella Mosby.",Man
Your father has finally finished drooling? Who wants ice cream?,Stella
You can talk to Tony? Robin made the trip from Tokyo. I should talk to him.,Ted
Of course.,Stella
Sorry to have run away like that.,Ted
"It's OK. Can you imagine not traveling I did. I was on a plane, a whole day. But it was worth it to see you get married.How I would have missed it...",Robin
You can not come to the wedding.,Ted
thank you God!,Robin
What?,Ted
It's weird.,Robin
It's not weird.,Ted
It's weird. You know how it feels to be one of the former married?,Robin
"Take that, bitch! I won!",Stella
"It was broken, there is more than a year.",Ted
"Yes, but it's not that long ago. See you marry another woman is not really something I look forward to. I just thought if I changed my mind about marriage and children, it was nice knowing you were there.",Robin
"So, I was your backup plan. It's flattering.",Ted
That's not it. It's just...,Robin
Why do you mention that? There was nothing between us.,Ted
"Maybe so. I mean, of course it does. The kind of thing that leaves no one fell swoop. I'm not a guest over.",Robin
"It's true. We went out together, but... we have moved on.And we got what we wanted. I marry, You have the job of your dreams in Tokyo. And they lived happily...",Ted
I quit my job.,Robin
You what?,Ted
"I return to New York. I thought I wanted this job, but...Getting back to my real life. And you should go back to yours.",Robin
What does that mean?,Ted
"You married. Listen, this is precipitated. It's as if you started a book by the end. You are the most romantic. You stole a blue horn for me. You tried to make rain.",Robin
I did the rain.,Ted
"It was a coincidence. After all this is how your romantic quest comes to an end? You hide in the wedding of another in his house in his life, without thinking twice. This is not the end spectacular than you deserve. It's not Ted Mosby.",Robin
I love Stella. This is good. If you feel it all... I think it is good that you come to the marriage.,Ted
Big fight?,Bartender
Yes.,Robin
There you go. It is for me.,Barman
"You stop it.  My God, so, stop.",Robin
I spend a very bad day. I've stolen scotch at the duty free. It tells you?,Robin
Let's go to your room. Far from it. And can be the whistle.,Barney
"I have no room. In fact, I thought I could stay with you.",Robin
No problem. I just need to tidy up a little. Of clothes on the floor and...,Barney
"And a girl naked, tied to your bed.",Robin
"The towels in the bathroom, a real mess. So, give me 10 minutes... to restore order...",Barney
"In addition, Barney.",Robin
"OK, let's go. Who's that?",Nora
The girl on reception.,Barney
Have his former close... it reveals unresolved problems.,Stella
"With your ex not far, which tells you that the flame will not turn back?",Stella
It's as if it was not over between you.,Stella
I've wasted years waiting for the father of Lucy decides to be ready for it.,Stella
You see all... made me realize what I had.,Tony
I dreamed that Tony is spontaneous like that.,Stella
"It's funny when I think about it. I was sure that Stella was good. When she left me, I was so devastated. But you helped me overcome that. Now the hard part is over. I came out a little louder. You know, I do not think further of it. This is the work of time, I guess.",Ted
"Ted, the wedding was yesterday. It's been 24 hours.",Lily
"I know. That's all I advance. A new chapter in my life begins today, and we'll celebrate. Here, we need two things.We need Kool and the Gang. It's time the jukebox!",Ted
"I watch this young man dancing near the jukebox, and I can not help thinking... Stella may have made the right choice. Ouch!",Barney
How can he dance here? He should be trying to smash the car with a club of Stella.,Marshall
"Assumption. He is not pretending to be happy. Ted is really happy. He did not want to marry from the start. Ted had the best train dodge since Stand by Me Well, not the first kid, but others.",Barney
"No, it is a mess.",Lily
It gauze?,Ted
A mess. And one must be there for him.,Lily
"Hey, man.",Lily
You wanna hang out?,Robin
"Girls, I'm fine.",Ted
"Dude, you make some?",Marshall
I'm fine.,Ted
"Hey, kid.",Barney
"Barney, I'm fine! It is not necessary, and it is rather unhealthy. Sorry, ladies.",Ted
I did not know you'd be here. Girls stairwell.,Barney
What do you want for dinner?,Ted
"Oh, the farm. I'm sorry, is that you have experienced something traumatic, and we try to be there for you, but do not you leave us, and it irritates us, selfish little whore. Sorry.",Lily
We are concerned that you faced not what happened with Stella. Do you remember when Lily left me? How I buried my emotions?,Marshall
It... I... miss him so much.,Marshall
"Yeah man, you've been a rock.",Robin
"I should have been worse, OK? I should have my nerves, follow your advice and burn cases Lily.",Marshall
"Super. Thank you, Ted.",Lily
"I have not done it, and that's why I took so long to get better. So Ted, I want you explode. Release your rage.Ready? Now!",Marshall
It's OK.,Ted
"Guys, let him go. He is happy. Listen, if Ted was married, then he would be married, he would live in New Jersey, and he would be married. It is well. Good, let's eat. Let Flat Michael's?",Barney
It is between the 44th and Lex. Impossible.,Ted
Why?,Robin
"It is near the gym Stella. We could cross. Everywhere else, it's going.",Ted
"Ok, how about Hurley's?",Robin
Stack between his office and dry cleaner. Sorry.,Ted
"Well, The Meatloaf Charlie?",Lily
Two blocks from her mother's hairdresser.,Ted
"Okay, Ted, is there a place in Manhattan where one can dine?",Barney
Of course. Look at this.,Ted
It's that thing?,Robin
A reference card I made. A guide to places where you can meet Stella Zinman. The red areas: to avoid. White: OK.Blue: the sea,Ted
This is ridiculous.,Lily
The sea is blue.,Robin
You can not live like this.,Lily
"It leaves you on the altar, and it's you who're avoiding?",Marshall
"Yes, I avoid it. What is the problem? It goes like this.",Ted
It's that one small dicks?,Marshall
"No, 'on', it is the people of the great state of Ohio. When life is hard, we take the pain and bury us. And if the pain goes, is buried pain over another. Why cope when you can avoid?All I have to do is to never see her again, and I will have a long happy life. So who wants to eat?",Ted
Someone told me of a tapas bar located in the white zone.,Lily
Super. Let's go.,Ted
Have you decided?,Waiter
Not yet. Can we have almonds to the table?,Ted
Certainly.,Waiter
"Well done, Lily. This place looks cool. That you talked about?",Ted
I actually remember it. Oh Oh!,Lily
What?,Robin
I remember.,Lily
"Oh my God! Oh my God! OK, stay cool. We'll just have to manage it. Everyone... follow me.",Ted
"Oh, you laugh.",Marshall
He is serious?,Lily
"I will not in this table. Possibly, in this one.",Barney
She turns around.,Robin
"Think, think. Guys, stay there. I'll take a look. Marshall will look.",Ted
Do you want covered?,Server
"No, I'm going home.",Stella
She took to win.,Marshall
She looks happy? She talked about me? I do not care.Where are the almonds?,Ted
Where may well be nuts Ted? You should check the garage in the grip of Stella.,Barney
Will the yelling.,Marshall
"You're maybe Ohio, but you live in New York now. We do not bury our emotions in New York. We take our emotions and they are sent to the other side!",Lily
Let me go. You'd do the same if you were in this situation.,Ted
I dream! There's not one person on Earth to which I would hide under a table.,Lily
"Really, not one? Not even... Gazeur?",Ted
How dare you pronounce this name to me?,Lily
Who is Gazeur?,Robin
This is the last person I would like to see here. Michael purifier. This is a guy I was in high school.,Lily
"Michael was next to me in Biology. It was a failure for the entire college, but the summer before the third, he grew 30 cm and joined the baseball team. It was becoming a cool guy.Until one day...",Lily
"Lily, you're all been there. When we loose one, it's not pretty.",Barney
You did what?,Robin
Are you kidding? It was the third. I had a choice.,Lily
"Oh, my God, purifier! It gauze?",Lily
It was not me. That was it.,Purifier
Of course purifier. Or rather Gazeur. Gazeur!,Lily
I'm in the team baseball. I'm cool.,Purifier
"The Gazeur nickname stuck. He had so much ridicule, he had to change schools.",Lily
The kids are great.,Barney
"It made me always feel guilty. But if Gazeur... Michael...came now, as hard as it may be, I would go to Gazeur...Michael... and I should settle things between us.",Lily
"Clearing the air, as before. Oh, man. It does not happen often. You are welcome.",Robin
It's going guys?,Server
"Let's just eat here, if possible.",Ted
This is your almonds.,Server
Thank you. You have a daily special?,Ted
"Ted, this is ridiculous.",Marshall
"I am a person who... Well, are facing. There are a bunch of people I do not want to see... as the group of girls that I skipped... but if one of them came here, I would stay there, and I would look into his eyes. For some, this would be the first time.",Barney
"Really, you hide from anybody? Not even... Becca Delucci?",Ted
Son of a bitch.,Barney
Who is Becca Delucci?,Host
Do you mind?,Barney
Who is Becca Delucci?,Robin
Becca is this girl who lives in the North. I saw her from time to time.,Barney
"Where exactly in the north, Barney?",Ted
Bedford Hills Federal Penitentiary.,Barney
"And yes, the visits were of a conjugal nature.",Barney
That's not true?,Lily
"Really. And that I had with Becca was a perfect relationship. She was allowed to call me once a week. If it becomes too sticky, the armed guards stoppaient. I've never had to pay for dinner. In fact, this is false. I pay taxes. I guess we all paid for dinner. Thank you, guys. Anyway, at the last visit, I screwed up.",Barney
"I know it's hard, baby, but I'm in a prison too.Imprisoned in my heart. This room is ready or what? We can...?",Barney
You're the only thing that kept me here.,Woman
"That's why I'm here, baby. I am your strength. I'm...Oh, my God. Hello, stranger.  Barney Stinson, attorney. Let's talk about your output.",Barney
"Hell, no!",Woman
"Now I have letters from Becca who say, I'll come see you the day I get out of here. I'll hang your eyes in my rearview mirror. Women, eh?",Barney
You see? Are you afraid of Becca. Lily is afraid of Gazeur.  are still under the table.,Ted
We do not need. Stella is a party.,Marshall
"Oh, my God. That's it, and that's it, the style Ohio. The problem manifested itself. It has been avoided. It is a party.Here you can dine in peace...",Ted
"It comes back.  We all think that you need... Wait, where is Barney?  We think you should talk to him.",Marshall
Not me.,Robin
What?,Marshall
"If the last person I wanted to see, came in I would not talk to him.",Robin
Really?,Ted
Who is it?,Lily
My father.,Robin
"Boy, this sure is another table. What are we talking?",Barney
From Robin's father.,Lily
I have not spoken to him in 3 years and I want to start now.,Robin
Why?,Lily
It goes back to my birth.,Robin
"Come on, give me my son. Grows.",Man
He wanted a son and the fact that I am a girl has not changed.,Robin
How so?,Ted
"My full name is Robin Charles Scherbatsky, Jr. And it only got worse.",Robin
"At 8, he took me hunting for the first time. I want to sh**t a deer.",Robin
But they're cute.,Robin
You said the same about our rabbits. You remember how they were delicious?,Father
My body started to change...,Robin
"Wait a second. Sorry, continues.",Barney
It was increasingly hard for him to act as if I was a boy.,Robin
The worst moment came in my 14 years. My junior hockey team had just won the Squamish Invitational. And everybody came to my house to celebrate.,Robin
"Guys, you have behaved splendidly there on the ice.Splendidly. You go outside. I come back with soft drinks and pretzels.",Father
"I can not believe you hast missed the last sh*t, silly.",Boy
You're an idiot.,Robin
"No, it's you, the idiot.",Boy
"What do you do? You are teammates, hockey players.Teammates do not kiss! Hockey players do not kiss! Oh, my God. I have no son.",Father
"My poor. Being forced to grow up in Canada with America, right next door.",Barney
"It's sad for your father, Robin, but congratulations for this game.",Marshall
And Kyle and I are doing anything serious. It was only the blue line.,Robin
The blue line?,Barney
"You know when you're a kid, you give the terms of hockey at all? The blue line is the kiss, the red is to be naked, and I think that crease speaks for itself. After that, my relationship with my father has cooled. I moved with my mother, let my hair grow, was a Canadian pop star. Young normal stuff.",Robin
You do not think you'd feel better if you talked to him?,Lily
"That's just it. It would be useless. This is history, it's done. I would say what? I wish not to be raised as a boy, that thou teach me not to hunt, fish and smoke cigars and drinking scotch because girls do not do that. And you know why I run like a girl? Because I am one. ",Robin
"You kept it for quite some time, eh?",Ted
Yes.,Robin
It has returned to you.,Ted
Sorry.,Marshall
It's hot.,Barney
I'll talk to him.  She's gone. I'll catch up.,Ted
"There, there.",Barney
There she is!,Ted
"I see. It is two taxis right front. Not lose it, OK?",Ted
"Well, well you do. You're going to confront it.",Marshall
I will face it.,Ted
This is so exciting.,Robin
Bluntly.,Ted
You're gonna say what?,Lily
"I will say, Sorry it did not work. We will discuss in adults. She'll tell me his views and... I will listen. What I should have done more before.",Ted
"You can fly it into the lamp? Fasten your seat belts!Not you, Ted.",Barney
You have to get angry. Go ahead. Looking good.,Marshall
"Come on. There is no question of moving his arms, stomping feet and get angry. This is Stella and I finally communicating. Clearly, it was...",Ted
Stella hated Star Wars. She lied to you. Seeking your feelings. You know it's true.,Marshall
That's his problem.,Ted
"Come on, Ted. She left you on the altar.",Barney
I understand!,Robin
In the name of all that is sacred...,Ted
"Wait, wait! Where it goes? His taxi has missed the exit for the Lincoln Tunnel.",Lily
"Why take it away to bring him back in New Jersey, anyway?",Robin
Maybe she goes to his office.,Ted
No.,Marshall
The waiter asked him: Do you want covered? And she said: I'm going home. ,Marshall
"If she goes to her, why you go to...? Oh, my God. Tony lives in the city center. At home is Tony's apartment. She would move in with me in New Jersey and moved to town, Tony? The bitch!",Ted
"Finally. Finally, my friend.",Marshall
I have the balls too!,Ted
"I know and I love it! It's great! Sir, we will pay gladly handle that has been broken. I love Ted angry!",Marshall
Me too!,Ted
"Lets get out, man, let out.",Marshall
She stops.,Lily
That's it. That's it!,Ted
"Yes, Ted. Come on, buddy!",Marshall
Get rid of your demons!,Robin
I have ants in my leg!,Barney
"OK, wait. Wait...",Lily
What are you doing?,Marshall
"Wait. Listen, Ted, it's great that you're angry...",Lily
Sure.,Marshall
"... and that you face all that, but... you only have one chance. Take a moment and think about what you will say.",Lily
"I know exactly what I say.  You chose the wrong guy. You chose the wrong guy. You did a very, very, very bad choice. What were you thinking? This guy? You kidding me? Have you learned anything these past 8 years? You'll be sorry. You know it? You'll be sorry, and you can do anything about it because it is too late. Anything you can do is start up your life miserable and disappointing that will never be as happy as it could be with me. Goodbye.",Ted
"Ted, wait.",Stella
"Look, I'm not there to pick you. I am here because I need to know that you know you've made the worst mistake of your life.",Ted
I know.,Stella
Okay.  This is what I say.,Ted
It k*ll!,Marshall
From cold bl*od.,Barney
"Okay, tell him that.",Lily
Mom!,Lucy
"I'm not impressed by the talent here tonight. And more I drink, the less it is attractive. I'm a whiskey and Coke in the Cantina scene in Star Wars.",Barney
And those girls over there? They are cannon.,Ted
Absolutely not.,Barney
"Are you kidding? I have hated as soon as I saw them. So they are cannon. In fact, I've hated almost as much as Robin when I've ever known.",Lily
You hate me?,Robin
A max.,Lily
"Barney, they are canon.",Marshall
"There is so much to learn. You are only v*ctim of...the effect cheerleaders. Good question. The effect cheerleading is when a group of women air cannon, but only in groups. As with the cheerleaders. They look like cannon, but take them individually? Cod.",Barney
Anything.,Ted
Look at it carefully. Individually.,Barney
I know. The last one is kinda cute.,Marshall
"Yeah, really cute.",Lily
"And this, my friends, is the effect cheerleaders. Also known as the paradox of a bridesmaid syndrome sorority, and for a brief moment in the 90s, the conspiracy of the Spice Girls.Scary Spice, indeed.  Barney Stinson. OK.Understood. Great, we remember.",Barney
What?,Ted
"Apparently, I'll be a father.",Barney
You're gonna be a father? How will it happen?,Ted
It's a girl I plugged in a few weeks ago. It is not certain.She sees the doctor tomorrow.,Barney
That may be a false alarm. It is perhaps not pregnant.,Lily
"No part of Barney Stinson does not run at less than 110%. If one of my Michael Phelps escaped, he swims for gold. It's a nightmare. I want no children. How can want to have children without being mad?",Barney
"You have not lost a sock, little guy? This is probably the cutest little thing I've ever seen.",Marshall
That's my little plug!,Woman
"So if you have a baby, you think you can work less?",Lily
"No matter, it will be so cute, I'm going to exhaust the first day.",Marshall
And for the money? It has a ton of debt.,Lily
We count the unpaid bills on her pretty little fingers.Let's make a baby.,Marshall
Now?,Lily
Push yourself. I recorded The View. This problem and was unemployed and sleeping on the couch.,Robin
"So, Robin, when you're in for the job and apartment?",Marshall
"Are not you aware? I am a presenter on CNN. And I have made gold a terrace overlooking Central Park. Get out of your ass's head, Marshall.",Robin
"Robin, would you mind not sleeping with Ted tomorrow night? I... prepares a special dinner for Marshall.",Lily
Just a dinner. That's it. Nothing else.,Marshall
"Okay, but you better not be as they stuck together when I cans on the roof. My ears. The neighbors called the cops.You almost hit me. ",Robin
Enjoy it. It is a good time.,Marshall
"God? It's me, Barney. Are you okay? I know we will not speak often, a bunch of girls said your name on my account. Great. But, God... If you could get out of there, I swear I'll never, never... never, never, never...  Wait, man. Barney to the device.Really?",Barney
Good news! I'm not a father!,Barney
"Congratulations, buddy.",Marshall
"This is the best time of my life, Marshall. What I feel in having no children? I have never thought something like it as much. That's why I created a public holiday. Now, today is Day of Non-fathers.",Barney
You create a holiday?,Marshall
"Why not? Everyone has one: mothers, fathers, soldiers. Why not a day for singles who like it?",Barney
It looks like a big day of Valentine's Day.,Marshall
"Hello, Stinson.",Man
Hi. How are the children?,Barney
"Ready for tonight, Eriksen? Big merger.",Man
"That's between me and my wife, sir.",Marshall
The meeting with Mr. Li Tonight.,Man
I thought it was a lunch.,Marshall
"Yes, in China. This is a teleconference with the Chinese.I count on you.",Man
Marshall?,Lily
Baby. It's lunchtime in China.,Marshall
Yeah.,Lily
"It's not a euphemism. Listen... Wait, what does that mean?",Marshall
"I know, hot bread, spicy pork? Stuff like that. You come not tonight, right? You shake your head for no? That's what I thought.",Lily
Thank you for coming so quickly.,Lily
Are you okay? You looked upset on the phone.,Robin
"Marshall and I, we took the decision to have a great...dinner. And I thought I was ready for a... dinner. But he called to cancel, and it got me thinking. Is it too early for us to make a... Dinner?",Lily
"I had lunch early, so I can eat.",Ted
"Dinner, it's a baby!",Lily
"Lily, it's horrible!",Robin
"No, I need you to clarify a situation for me.",Lily
What?,Robin
"Are we ready, Marshall and me to have a baby? So, are we ready to have a baby or not?",Lily
We can not decide for you. It's huge.,Ted
You know what is huge? Marshall's head. It is as big as a watermelon in late August. Marshall's baby who is passing by?,Robin
He thinks what?,Ted
A lot of things in the helmet of the space of 50 years who serves as its head.,Robin
Marshall is really excited. But I think he sees only the good sides of it.,Lily
"The other day while playing with the little Jeremy, I was talking with his mother.",Lily
"Thank you for the invitation. It's been a while since I have not told an adult. Well, except my husband. But For you to change and Make him be silent, it's not really count as conversation. Sorry, I ramble. It's been 7 months that I have not kissed. That's it, I start! Lack of sleep! Wait, I cry there, though?It happens to me often. I will not complain. Here, I feel bad!That's my little plug! I love you so much!",Woman
"I will be as carbon copy Charlotte. Worse. At least, her husband works at home. Well, he deale of shit, but it is a caring father.",Lily
Marshall is a very good father.,Ted
"Marshall is always at work, and I'm afraid to hit all the work if we have one now.",Lily
You panic and you see only bad side.,Ted
I think it's just realistic.,Robin
"Well, that's perfect. That's why I called you. Ted, you're for children. Robin, you're against. Councillors, please proceed.",Lily
"OK, I know you're afraid of not being ready. But we think ever be. You just take the plunge and it will come naturally.",Ted
"Of course for you, it is natural, you're practically already a father.",Robin
You're a father too.,Lily
What are you talking?,Ted
"Ted, thoughtful. You go out jokes father of super lame.",Robin
A cereal k*ll! A cereal k*ll!,Ted
You make us moral. Like when you broke your ship in a bottle.,Robin
I'm not sorry. I'm just disappointed.,Ted
That's it!,Barney
Shut up!,Robin
And you do that thing that all fathers are with the waitresses.,Robin
My name is Lori. I'll be your waitress tonight.,Waitress
"Hello, Lori, me, this is Ted. I will be your customer tonight.Before leaving, tell me. What is a k*ll in a wheat field? No index.",Ted
"She's right. Perhaps you're single and childless, but you're really a redneck dad.",Lily
"I do not appreciate that tone, young lady.",Ted
The No-Fathers Day is a success! Laraby Finklestein and help me celebrate. Matt. Mugs Best Non-Father of the world. There... T-shirts Who is your daddy? Available on fetedesnonperes.com. Looking greeting cards.,Barney
"For everything you do for your pear, for all the tape on your desk, on the road darkens your Porsche Carrera, I wish you... a night of threesome. Happy Birthday Non-Fathers. ",Marshall
Look at the illustration.,Barney
It looks like an Asian hooker.,Marshall
"Because at the Non-Fathers Day, you have a Thai girl you a blowjob. Tope, puns!",Barney
"It puts you in the mash, then. Your only hope is to be negative.",Lily
I'll tell you why my opponent says it all. Three words: fear of... babies.,Ted
What? You're crazy. This is false.,Robin
Really?,Ted
And when we saw my cousin and her baby? She's so cute!,Ted
You want to wear it?,Cousin
Where the party that Lily had done for her friend Erika?You do feel for this baby?,Ted
I do not want to bite.,Robin
And do not forget...,Ted
Pub with baby talk?,Marshall
Pub with baby talk.,Ted
But you're not like that. You like children too.,Ted
"Yes, I'm lovely, beautiful and brilliant, but it's enough?",Lily
"It comes down to one word: you. Are you ready to put your dreams in the background? Back in college, taught art at the university? You have to concentrate on the project before starting Lily Baby Project. Otherwise, you'll regret it forever.And it would be good neither for you nor for the baby. What is it?",Robin
The sock Jeremy. I will make a baby.,Lily
"Well, and everything I said?",Robin
But sock.,Lily
And Marshall who works all the time?,Robin
But sock.,Lily
But but Lily Project!,Robin
With small fish.,Lily
"We had this debate, and this is the sock that makes you make the decision?",Robin
"I think you're taking a chausettogari, eh, Robin?",Ted
"Shut up, Dad.",Robin
"You, shut up, baby-phobic.",Ted
"Babies are scary, OK? With their giant eyes. And seriously, the fontanelle? If there is a self-destruct button, at least, hide it where it will not accidentally press.",Robin
Where is Lily? You have to drink?,Ted
Not a drop.,Robin
I do not either.,Ted
"Meeting in 5 minutes. You better be on top for Mr. Li This haunts my nightmares. Finally, have fun well, small.",Men
"Put a baby in me, Marshall. I'm ready.",Lily
What are you doing here?,Marshall
I'm ready. This is the big night. Removing your seed melon-headed in my belly.,Lily
What?,Marshall
"Come on, come on. Make me a baby. I'm ready. Hey, look. The types of the other building make me cuckoo. Hello, gentlemen! We will make a baby!",Lily
"I dream, it has been lost.",Ted
That's why I have no children. We can not even taking his eyes for a second.,Robin
I can not find my file.,Marshall
I'm all out of A to G.,Lily
"They sit there with their stupid bottles. They cry. They vomit. That's why babies, it sucks.",Robin
That's good that we have broken. I had totally forgotten your psychosis on the kids.,Ted
"My psychosis? Whenever you hear the word kid, you have two small Milk tasks on your shirt.",Robin
"God thank you, you're not my mother. You're an ice queen. All you have breastfed baby by a frozen brain.",Ted
Do not depict me as a monster for wanting to remain independent. In there is a lot of people who do not want it.,Robin
"My brother, lay your hand on the box tops and repeat after me. Me, the false name you give to women.",Barney
"I, Johnny Banana.",Man
Swear to always choose the wet t-shirts to wet diapers.,Barney
Swear to always...,Man
You're in good company there.,Ted
I'll see if the toilet. I also want to bring you back buffer.,Robin
"Okay. When you have finished, you could ask a magician to heart.",Ted
You know what? I should find another place to sleep.,Robin
No argument.,Ted
Well.,Robin
Super.,Ted
Welcome to our fraternity of non-paternity. In is one of ours.,Barney
"Gentlemen, Mr. Li, if you will go to page 5 of your file merge. I think...",Marshall
"What has he, Eriksen?",Man
Nothing. I think you are... very beautiful today.,Marshall
What are you looking?,Man
I look at the future... of our two companies and it seems very... naked. Will you excuse me one second?,Marshall
"Guys, you did not... This is a picture of me without children. And with macaroni glued to the frame. Guys, I love it.",Barney
Lily is not there.,Robin
Your cell phone rang. I answered. Hope it bother you. Lily is at Marshall. She is fine.,Ted
thank you God. What?,Robin
"When storing your mobile, I found something in your bag.",Ted
I have a permit for that. And the other thing is a gift.,Robin
You've stolen the Ca sock Jeremy.,Ted
No. I do not know what she's doing there. It must have fallen into it. Bizarre!,Robin
Falling in? ,Ted
Or Lily put it there for fun. That bitch is stuffed. I took it.It's just... so cute. Sock.,Robin
"Robin Scherbatsky, you get the idea of having children?",Ted
"I know. One day, perhaps. When I'm 70. Science will catch me. I'm just... I'm lost right now. I'm unemployed, I live on a couch.",Robin
There were two difficult months both. I have a room free.Why not come to me in the meantime?,Ted
Really?,Robin
Yeah.,Ted
"Thank you, Ted. I have some ideas, so it will be one week, two large max.",Robin
I'm bored. Come and dance. Come fly a liquor store!,Lily
"We're going nowhere. Each time we go out when you're drunk, you always fall asleep when you enter the...",Marshall
Let's dance! We gonna party all night!,Lily
Can you make several turns to make sure she is asleep?,Marshall
Sure.,Driver
"The last great idea for Fathers Day-No, a pregnancy test, but instead of a blue line, there is a small blue Barney who does that.",Barney
"Day of Non-Fathers, it sucks. It's a feast for the losers.",Ted
What are you talking? This is a good group of friends.,Barney
This is the effect cheerleaders.,Ted
"No, Ted. It works for girls.",Barney
"Look at these guys, individually. These geniuses are not childless by choice, my friend.",Robin
"Good night, Barney.",Ted
Good night.,Robin
Sock.,Barney
I smell pancakes with chocolate?,Marshall
"No, you feel pancake, I'm sorry for being such a stupid drunk chocolate.",Lily
There's no I wish not to throw up on you bacon?,Marshall
Of course.,Lily
Baby...,Marshall
I blame myself for last night. I was really painful. I just panicked at the thought of whether we are ready to parent. But you are so well taken care of me. I know you're gonna be a good father.,Lily
I want to be a father now.,Marshall
What?,Lily
"Last night, it was just... I share between work and drunk baby Lily, it was too. I just begin with this job, I work long hours... I love you. And I really want to have children one day.I just want... I want to be ready for that.",Marshall
"Me too. When we're ready, I know you'll be fantastic.",Lily
You too.,Marshall
"You wanna make love, by protecting themselves now?",Lily
Yes.,Marshall
You want to finish your bacon first?,Lily
You're the perfect woman.,Marshall
"And the cat is in the cradle and the silver spoon Little Boy Blue and the Man on the Moon. When are you going back home, Dad? I do not know when we're together then, son I know we will have a good time. ",Barney
"So, it seems that Marshall has to work late on Friday.You know what that means, party girls.",Robin
"Well, a teacher at my school, Jillian, a birthday. What?",Lily
"It's just that... I have never heard of this before Jillian, and suddenly, it's your best friend. You do not stop talking about her.",Robin
Do not be jealous. We hang out together all the time.,Lily
"Yeah, but Marshall is still there. There was not much time to talk, just us two.",Robin
This is false.,Lily
This is where the story gets really good. So it goes...,Robin
Hi.,Marshall
"... place. And then this... guy talking about this thing with the stuff of which I spoke the other day about this place.Well, anyway... it happened.",Robin
My God. You and the guy the mayor's office did it to the UN under the office of Ambassador of Zaire? Cool.,Marshall
"I wish we had time for girls. I love Marshall, but I am not free to express myself.",Robin
"Come with me and Jillian, then.",Lily
"OK, but I want to stay too late because...  Do you remember... this thing last month after going there? You know who said it was going, but she gave me tips.",Robin
You always mycoses?,Marshall
I want to take this moment.,Barney
Which one?,Marshall
The last time you and I are just competing for the title of best friend Ted.,Barney
Marshall is my best friend.,Ted
Exactly. Draw. But it's all about to change. Is it correct that you are an architect?,Barney
"My best friend does not, but still.",Ted
You draw what now?,Barney
"Well, you renovate the library Nouillorc.",Ted
That's great!,Robin
"No, not the New York Public Library. This is the library Nouillorc, in Dakota. Their books are in two parts: fishing and not fishing.",Ted
I think you'll love what's happened at work.,Barney
"While corruption has destabilized the regime and k*ll most of the royal family, it helped to relax banking regulation in Rangoon. Good for us. Last order of the meeting it was decided to continue on the project's new headquarters in the city of Goliath National Bank.",Bilson
Who's going to draw?,Ted
That was my first question.,Barney
Who's going to draw?,Barney
We approached a company. This Swedish architectural collective called Sven.,Bilson
Sven?,Ted
I hate them. Swedish architecture collective.,Ted
No one.,Robin
Pretentious.,Lily
It is not a company. It is a collective. ,Ted
I know. We're Swedish. It's so cool with our baguettes and our Eiffel Tower. ,Barney
"Sweden, this is not France. You know that?",Marshall
"It's France. No matter, I told Bilson...",Barney
"Bislon, saving your...",Barney
"No, I get up, and I told Bilson...",Barney
"Bislon, saving your...",Barney
Music. Imagine a patriotic music.,Barney
"Bilson, with all due respect... it would be terrible if a job that would suit American architects was relevant to a band of French. Where is our patriotism? Love of country? Our love of all that...",Barney
"Listen, Stinson, no one hates all the other countries of the world than me, but you have arguments?",Bilson
Yes. I know a great American architect who would be perfect. Ted Mosby.,Barney
"All you have to do is come and offer your drawing, I take care of the Board, the project is yours.",Barney
You realize what a hero I'd be if I brought this project to my box?,Ted
"It's not the best. We three, we'll work together.",Barney
Ted will come to call.,Marshall
"Yes, totally.",Barney
What is it?,Ted
It works like this: one of us goes into the office the other and said...,Barney
"Marshall, the teleconference begins soon.",Barney
"Sorry, I gotta go.",Marshall
And then you go up on the roof... and drink beer.,Barney
It's great. Drinking at work.,Marshall
"Basically, it is of Mad Men.",Barney
Yes! There is too much Mad Men!,Marshall
I'll spank a secretary.,Barney
That's exactly what they would do in this series.,Marshall
What series?,Barney
And then you throw the bodies of cans at pigeons.,Barney
I do not do that.,Marshall
I love to do that.,Ted
I will realize your dream.,Barney
"Seriously, Barney, from what I've lived with Stella, I have this opportunity... it touches me.",Ted
"Your friend has a birthday here? She has what, 19?",Robin
"No. Believe me, it's not his style. She must not know what kind of place this is.",Lily
"We're here, my little p *** sexy! We just get served!",Jillian
Wooo!,All
"Oh, my God. At school, she is so calm and normal. I thought it was not... a Woo.",Lily
"My God, this song is my story too.",Jillian
Wooo!,All
"Oh my God, I was afraid of not having fed the cat, then I remembered that I had done.",Jillian
Wooo!,All
"I swear, at school, Jillian is not so Woo.",Lily
It was not like a Woo. Perhaps it is that holidays like Mardi Gras and the day of the year. Maybe this is a cyclical Woo.,Robin
"Okay, be cool with me. This is a first draft.",Ted
"Ted, it's incredible. Detail. Shadows. The liveliness of the lines. This is exactly what Princess Leia would look like, topless.",Barney
"My way of saying thank you. Okay, you wanna see my designs for the building?",Ted
"No, that's fine.",Barney
"Listen to this. Lily sent me a text message. It was at this bar, The Giddy Ups with full of Woos.",Marshall
"My God, girls, my breast just out of my top bar. And no! I took it out for a drink blackjack!",Jillian
Wooo!,All
"So, Jillian, it seems that when you not flash the bartenders, you are mistress of CE1. How is it?",Robin
"If rewarding. I dunno if you know the RIE method, but it derives from the philosophy of progressive education Steiner founded the Waldorf school, which is... Oh my God, I love this song! Come on bitches, let's dance!",Jillian
Wooo!,All
"You too, my ****** s.",Jillian
No thank you... drag ignorant.,Lily
"Lily Aldrin, little secretive. For years, I say that our gang needs a Woo, and thou hast hid me in a whole herd.",Barney
You do not need a Woo. Nobody needs it.,Lily
"Attention Lily. The world badly needs the Woos. If there were not Woos, there would not Girls Gone Wild, no bachelor party girl, no pool bar in Las Vegas... all the things you hold dear would not exist.",Barney
None of this stuff...,Lily
"Industry sh**t memories would collapse. Just like the glitter body and that of Hummer limos. The mini cowboy hats would be worn by the little cowboys. And when Brown Eyed Girl happen on a jukebox, you do not hear... that silence. And Brown Eyed Girl. But who would Woo, Lily?Who would woo? Would you? You'd... Woo?",Barney
Who wants to name my tits?,Jillian
Wooo!,All
"Well you'll excuse me, I have a date with Bataille and Fontaine.",Barney
"And we think this design will radiate timeless power and stability of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen.",Ted
"Hey, Barney! Give me the good news.",Ted
You did not have.,Barney
What?,Ted
The Board... Sven decided to choose.,Barney
I can not believe I had not. I thought I had hit the nail. Why did they choose Sven?,Ted
I've done everything to change their minds. But they did not budge. I'm sorry.,Barney
It's really bad. After the way the last few months have passed... I guess I'd need more than I thought.,Ted
"You want to go to the current GNB building and just... I dunno, just a little pee on it?",Marshall
I think I need it.,Ted
Finish Your Beer. Fill the machine.,Barney
It's been what?,Robin
Ted did not get the job. But this is not the biggest disappointment of the day.,Lily
What?,Robin
You were seen to Woo.,Lily
"Given that, do Woo?",Robin
You who did Woo?,Lily
I have not done Woo.,Robin
"Oh, yes.",Lily
That's not true.,Robin
Your nose is growing. You've become best friends with Jillian now?,Lily
"It's just... You're married, I'm still single. Whenever I'm with you, I'm usually the 3rd wheel. Sometimes it's nice to go out with other singles and doing stuff you do not.",Robin
Like what?,Lily
"As to Woo, Lily. As to Woo.",Robin
I can Woo.,Lily
That's not true.,Robin
But if.,Lily
"It's not you, that.",Robin
"Bilson? I just wanna say, I know that you chose Sven, but... Ted Mosby is extremely talented, and... he would have made a hell of a job.",Marshall
Yes. I voted for him.,Bilson
It's okay. All withdrawals at ATMs are free.,Barney
Teleconference. Now.,Marshall
You wanna tell me something?,Marshall
Good grief. I told Heather to put everything back as it was on your desk.,Barney
Bilson told me he wanted to give the job to Ted.What has happened?,Marshall
Okay.,Barney
"... will radiate power and stability of the Goliath National Bank. Thank you, gentlemen.",Ted
So?,Barney
It was great. I like it.,Bilson
It looks like we had our man. I not think there need to see...,Barney
"I'm Sven Jorgensen. With me, there's Pilsen and Sven Sven Johanssen, and it is... Sven! You are the Goliath National Bank. You are at the forefront. You are new and fresh.Women want to be with you, men want to hurt you, but the fool who dares challenge you will be crushed! Your home office will show the world these facts. And one more thing... Do not look now!  Who is Barney Stinson, the head of the Research Committee?",Man
"Oh, my God. It's me!",Barney
"You, Barney Stinson, are a man of power and virility.Your office will be here in the head of Tyrannosaurus.",Sven
"I've never known so far, but I've always wanted.",Barney
"On your desktop rosewood Honduras, there is this button.",Sven
What does this button?,Barney
Press! Press for the glory!,Sven
It's building the coolest of the universe. It could not be more awesome.,Barney
There is a striptease club in the letter N.,Sven
"What is your problem? This is the big break of Ted!You have betrayed to work in the brain of a Tyrannosaurus, which, incidentally, if you knew the dinosaurs is very, very small.",Marshall
It's not my office. The building was well Ted. That of Sven was better. And I will not let the fact that I am the best friend of Ted influence business.,Barney
You have not chosen one of Sven because he was better. You wanted an office dinosaur.,Marshall
"It's a lie! I chose it because it... He breathes fire, Marshall.",Barney
Fire Marshall.,Marshall
I have not even paid attention.,Barney
How could you do that to Ted after all that happened with Stella? You are an egoist.,Marshall
"I never made a career choice by selfishness. I am a professional. Go. Spend a good day, drunk, and throw the bodies of the pigeons.",Barney
"No. For two reasons. A, pigeons are smarter than you think. They are resentful. And two, it's our last conference call, Mr. Stinson. There are repercussions to ride a friend.",Marshall
Like what?,Barney
"Because, that.",Marshall
"My God, girls. Yesterday, we collected $ 10 000 for my charity that fights illiteracy children. It's a real problem.",Jillian
Someone won a trip buttocks until the first dance floor of the canyon of spanking!,Robin
Wooo!,All
Wooo!,Lily

Come and dance.,Jillian
"Lily, it does not work. You should not be there.",Robin
"I get it. Because I am happily married, I'm a schmuck?",Lily
"On the contrary. Why do you think the Woo Woos have to when they win a drinking game? Or when a guy takes off his g*n t-shirt? Because that's all that life brings. These are...People really sad. And when she go out with someone who has it all, someone like you, it's disappointing. It takes them Woo.",Robin

Really?,Ted
"The committee realized he had erred. In addition, you are precious to them and they want you to be happy.",Barney
It's weird.,Ted
"Your plans were the best and you deserve it. You should know one thing that you did not get the job early. You see, Ted...",Barney
"It was Bilson. Bilson wanted to have a head office in the dinosaur, Barney convinced him that it was really, really stupid.",Marshall
You know...,Barney
"Thank you, Barney. I believe it. I brought in my box the largest contract that she had. Wooo!  The next is for me.",Ted
Why you helped me?,Barney
"You did the right thing. You got a well deserved boost. And then it would have disappointed Ted, and it is finally... very happy for the moment.",Marshall
"You are truly the best friend Ted. And me too. Tie.Thank you, Marshall.",Barney
"I love you, man.",Ted

Hi.,Ted
Hi.,Woman
For me it's Ted.,Ted
"I was left on the altar, there is one month.",Ted
"It was a complete disaster and since then I have not even managed to look at another woman. Except the old lady in the subway that makes break dancing. I look at it that way. I just watched. Finally, it is an old lady who made the break dance.And it is good. I will give him a dollar, the next time. Let's pretend I said it: These travel lift were asleep the moment of my week, and I would like to see you Friday night. In a lift. At the restaurant, nice. What do you think?",Ted

It's been 12 minutes!,Marshall
Put it!,Robin

Ask your w*apon!,Robin
You're who?,Ted
"What are you doing, Mitch?",Ted
You must be the roommate. I'm with Robin. She came out to take a call. I think its handheld gaming here.,Mitch
"Robin did not use the super secret signal. We put the old menu on the handle. This restaurant had to close. Mr. Popol...No need to explain why it's funny. I'm off. When leaving, take the pillow with you. This is a waste now.",Ted
"I think I am more than qualified for the job. My weaknesses? I would say too caring, overworked, and I spend my career first. Oops! The latter is true. What?",Robin
"Apparently, our sweet, innocent, little Robin led a lover. A young skinny named Mitch.",Ted
His thing arranged? A real disaster. She sent me text messages all night. She just let go to use the bathroom.,Lily
Excuse me one minute.,Ted
"Man, you annoy me. I am in action here.",Mitch
What action?,Ted
"This is my technique. It's called, The guy with hair.",Mitch
The guy naked?,Ted
"That's the trick. You're the first date, you've had a few drinks, you go out an excuse to go to the girl.",Mitch
"The bathroom is.  You know what, I will respond.",Robin
"Then when she leaves, you undress and wait for you.When she returns, she laughs. She is so fascinated by your insurance, and your bravado she sleep with you.",Mitch
No chance it works!,Ted
Two out of three.,Mitch
Two out of three?,Ted
"Two out of three. You just choose your moment. The guy naked mostly run as a last resort, the last resort to first appointment when you know that there will be no second.",Mitch
How do you know?,Ted
Look at me.,Mitch
I'd rather not.,Ted
"Robin is not in my division. I'm not smart, funny and handsome. As you can see, there is nothing impressive nowhere there. My only chance with a girl like Robin, is the surprise. And let's be honest, a little pity. This is shock and Ohhh.",Mitch
It does not work really.,Ted
Two out of three. Guaranteed.,Mitch
No December '.,Marshall
Two out of three. He assured me.,Ted
"Seriously. No chance it works on Robin. It will come, take a look at this idiot and send tampers.",Barney

"Barney, this guy has slept with Robin, you say that being in love. How it makes you excited?",Lily
"The naked guy is more important than me and Robin. All these years, I broke my ass, with my secret identity, my laps and my gadgets. I mean, I'm Batman. But this guy is Superman. He tears his clothes and go.",Barney
What kind of gadgets you talking about?,Lily
"So, it's going to be, a roommate? I come home, and guys with whom you will go out sitting on the couch, naked.",Ted
I can not tell you.,Robin
I can not believe that The guy with hair 'market has on you.,Ted

I say ***** s!,Marshall
Sorry?,Robin
"Sorry Robin, but cate with this type suggests that all that separates you from sex, it's the clothes.",Marshall
I have not slept with Mitch because he was naked.,Robin
"So, why did you lie?",Marshall
Because... It... It... because I like Mitch. Much. There was a... connection specificity. Specificity and feelings.,Robin
"Because he was naked. Sorry, but I disagree. There is only one reason to sleep with someone, and it is love.Marshall is a big girl because he believes in love and read And it was true because the secretaries were forced to join the Oprah book club. But you know I'm right.",Marshall
"Marshall, I love you, but there are plenty of reasons to lie.",Lily

"I'll give you 50. There's sex reconciliation... breaking sex, and sex a friend told you about a new position.",Lily
"You're welcome. There is also revenge, bounce back, parachuting. When you're traveling, but instead of going to the hotel, you'll live in a bar to find a girl to get a foothold.",Barney
"Oh, that, the kiss for a roof.",Robin
***** S!,Marshall
I do not. My roommate in college did.,Robin

"Oh, I have one. Sex bugger all on TV.",Lily
The sex hotel room.,Ted
"Curiosity, style, Me have always wondered how to do this is with a great girl. Big guy not a girl, just great. Like...if a normal girl was 2.10 m, 2.25 m high, and... wearing a mini denim skirt. I wonder how it is.",Barney

"A toast... Mitch. The sum of its parts makes him a man.But when it serves its parts, it becomes much more. It does not fit the definition of a hero, but he is the one I needed.

Not if Prince is on tour.,Marshall
"my sister's plane arrived an hour ago, or would like a meteorologist, hurricane between Heather on Lands.",Ted
Go. It's not like that.,Lily
"That's the history of Heather. It has been six years and three high schools for his baccalaureate. She took the opportunity to ruin two cars, being married for five days, and spent nine weeks in a tree only to find that no one intended to k*ll him. And there, Heather said she moved to New York.",Ted
Great news.,Lily
It will not come out. Remember when she talked of going to college here? And then the day of admission...,Ted
Where are my TV and my couch?,Ted
I have sold tickets for the concert of Nine Inch Nails.,Woman
Nothing but the TV is 2000 balls.,Ted
A last minute flight is expensive.,Woman
Wait. Where are you?,Ted
Somewhere in Spain. I go there. Quiet song.,Woman
Damn. This is Barney.,Ted
And?,Robin
"Since that time Heather happening in New York, Ted has never left the Barney show.",Lily
"I never will. Every year, when the greeting card of Mosby happens...",Ted
If I could see her naked. If I could see her naked. If I could see her naked. And fours.,Barney
"Ted has a little sister who is so playful every day. And if I meet with her breasts, I will play! Little sister, Little Sister!What? I can also celebrate Hanukkah.",Barney
"It's still him. I should answer. Hello, Barney.",Ted
Hi. What are you doing tonight?,Barney
"We go to Marshall and Lily get a full Kathy Bates, Misery exception. Want to go? He hung up.",Ted
It's nice to see you.,Heather
Hi kid. It looks to go. How are things at home?,Ted
I took your room. Did you know you see the room of Miss Gottwald opposite?,Heather
I know. She looks good?,Ted
"Ted, it was 62 years.",Heather
Answer.,Ted
"Incredibly gay.  Dude, quail out there.",Heather
"Why, hello. I was expecting you.",Barney
One second. It is not our chair. You've made yourself?,Ted
I needed one that rotates.,Barney
How did you know that Heather was coming?,Ted
Do not tell me anything! You know I can not keep secrets if it's almost Christmas! Robin offers you an iPod!,Lily
Can I talk to one second in the kitchen? Not touch the chair. I praise him. I can not believe that thou hast hid thy sister all these years.,Barney
Really? You're like Weird Al Yankovic to write that song on how to jump my sister.,Ted
"First, I'm flattered. Then it's just jokes. A friend can joke on a friend's sister. Does not mean I'm going to act.",Barney
"I love my sister, and as a big brother, it's my job to protect guys like you.",Ted
You do not trust me?,Barney
No. And it either.,Ted
Okay. All right. I'll just... take my chair and leave.,Barney
Wait... Rest... Back... Lily and I were dining out with Heather Sunday. Want to go?,Ted
I have already called to add a person.,Barney
You really can not tell Lily.,Ted
"No, nothing really...",Barney
Hi everyone.,Marshall
Marshall!,All
This is Robin.,Marshall
Robin!,All
Turn drink.,Marshall
Drink!,All
"How are you, Marshall?",Man
"And you? Hey, man! You got anything in the leg?",Marshall
I played hockey today. I hurt my knee.,Man
You went to the hospital?,Robin
I poured beer on it. I miss the game of the Vikings.Minnesota!,Man
I love the guys here. This is real guys. Without shampoo or manicure. The guys from New York are 10% chick.,Robin
Go. You're wrong.,Marshall
I'll take the vichyssoise with a hint of cream. Dairy ballonnent me.,Barney
So... I found an apartment today.,Heather
Really?,Ted
"Yes. And I hoped you would have drunk a little more wine hand side before you to ask you this, but... I need you to lease the instructions.",Heather
Let me think.,Ted
"It, it means he will not.",Barney
I really need your help.,Heather
"We'll talk later, OK?",Ted
You do not have any illusions.,Barney
What's the matter? You do not trust me?,Heather
You're my sister.,Ted
There he just says the obvious.,Barney
"Listen, Ted, I want to get into finance, but... you see me like I was four and I wanted to become an astronaut.",Heather
I just think you have no idea of the difficulty of succeeding in New York.,Ted
"Exactly. Do you need relationships. If only Ted knew someone who works at, say... Goliath National Bank, then...expect. What? I work for Goliath National Bank. Incredible!",Barney
Okay. It's been two beers and Bemidji... who ordered the mini burgers?,Man
My God! This is Fisherman's Quest? I played all the time FQ at the time!,Robin
"Oh, yeah? I have the best score. Without boasting, I caught... a pike of almost 1 m. The biggest fish virtual nobody has ever taken. Finally... freshwater.",Marshall
I'll take my hat fisherman. Thank you for bringing me here. This is mine.,Robin
It's not a good idea. Heather and Barney alone in his office? And I do not want to be guarantor for the lease.,Ted
"It ripens, just as you see it yet.",Lily
"It is about a girl who got caught for stealing, eight months ago.",Ted
"Ted, many women have a period kleptomaniac. And yes, maybe sometimes they happen to mow a small object because it excites them in a strange way they are not explained. But... If it reassures you, I will accompany them to GNB, tomorrow. I will say that I'm going to lunch with Marshall, but in fact I espionnerai.",Lily
It suits me. Good luck tomorrow at the GNB. I'm sure you will impress them.,Ted
And I espionnerai. And shit!,Lily
I drink to forget the 1999 NFC Championship?,Robin
"The match. The Vikings were 2 minutes to go to the Super Bowl, when our striker, who had not missed a year's messed up a penalty and we lost in overtime. Damn!",Marshall
1999 NFC Championship Game?,Male
Yes.,Marshall
Damn!,Man
"My father, I had never seen him cry in my life, wiped away a tear. He said... A small part of me just died, son. ",Marshall
I love the passion you have for your Vikings. It's like looking for hockey in Canada... What?,Robin
Do not let... anyone here know that you're not from Minnesota.,Marshall
Why? They will do anything q'ils learn that I am...,Robin
"Bemidji. Bemidji, Minnesota. Go Vikes!",Robin
"Very nice, this briefcase.",Heather
"Very friendly, the security camera, too. And there is one another. And a security guard.",Ted
"I intend to pay it, Ted.",Heather
"Yes. You got the job yet. Must push the door, not pull.And that's it. Thank you for having watched yesterday. Maybe I was wrong. She seems to have been able to manage with Barney. It will perhaps manage New York.",Ted
Not enough!,Lily
Why?,Ted
I have a secret. No! It has not happened. It happened something.,Lily
It's been what?,Ted
"Nothing. After the interview Heather, I went to see Marshall one time, when I came back...",Lily
My God!,Lily
"Before you say or do something, give me a favor.",Barney
What?,Lily
Move away. It's a Prada.,Barney
I'm really sorry.,Lily
I knew it. I've always known. It remained the same trail irresponsible. And when I see Barney...,Ted
"You will say nothing. Ted, Heather begged me not to tell you. She hate me if she knows that I sneaked.",Lily
"I love this kit, but I can not afford. You were right, Ted.",Heather
And how!,Ted
You see? She has not bought the briefcase! It is responsible! And no chance that she slept with someone here.She turns the page.,Lily
Hi everyone!,Marshall
So my father and I were in the NFC championship game by 99.,Robin
"I said, good evening everyone!",Marshall
And when we missed the penalty and lost...,Robin
Holy shit!,All
"Holy shit! f*cking. My father that I had never seen him cry in my life, wiped away a tear and said, A small part of me just died, son. ",Robin
Son?,Man
"That's what I tell my son. If I am fortunate to have a son, I will call Rashad Tarkenton.",Robin
Nice story.,Man
Beautiful story! But it seems a bit familiar.,Marshall
I know! They all bought into.,Robin
I see what you do.,Marshall
What?,Robin
"I've brought here because... I was sorry for you. And there, it looks like you're trying to steal my bar.",Marshall
You think I'm trying to steal your bar? Host.,Robin
Host? Are you Canadian?,Man
"No, I...",Robin
"If you want to imitate a Canadian, just turn off the light and act as if you were afraid!",Man
What was that?,Robin
"With the nearby Canada, Minnesota, we like to make jokes on your back and they are often on the same theme.",Marshall
As fear of the dark?,Robin
"Yes. For example, everyone, how many Canadians does it take to change a lightbulb? What? No, the bulb is dead? I'm afraid! ",Marshall
This is stupid. Why do you think Canadians are afraid of the dark?,Robin
"Where do prejudices? A stereotype appears, and suddenly, it spreads like fire. Asians misbehave, the Scots are stingy, the Brazilians are too many stamps. I doubt it works.You can not hang out with people who belittle your beloved country. I take you back.",Marshall
"No, wait. I have something to say. Everyone. Let me tell you something about Canadians.",Robin
"Please, no scene.",Marshall
"Why Canadians are not of birthday wishes? Because they are too afraid to put out the candles. My God, I love this place!",Robin
I think your prospects are good for GNB. U you have shown me that you can take any position.,Barney
This is the new coasters?,Lily
I hope you get the job. Nothing makes me happier than to fill an opening.,Barney
"I swear, these coasters are thicker.",Lily
I'm ready to bend over backwards.,Heather
"OK, enough! I can not believe you hast slept with my sister!",Ted
You've sneaked?,Barney
You know what? It's a new batch of old coasters. I will confirm with the bartender.,Lily
"Barney and I, we did nothing.",Heather
Come on. Lily saw you.,Ted
Oh yeah?,Barney
"You see, Ted, you have so little faith in me and Heather...",Barney
... That we decided to show you what you expect from us.,Heather
And as we can count on Lily to sneak.,Barney
My God!,Lily
What? Why do this?,Ted
Because you deserve it.,Heather
"Ted, you know, I'm not a saint. And yes, it is true that the times I drove your mother at the airport, say that there has been a... sexually confused and confusing time in the parking lot, but I said I draguerai not your sister, and I thought. You should have me believe.",Barney
"You're so convinced that I am still a teenager out of control, you forgot that I grew up. I'll find a hotel. I will take my business later. Merry Christmas.",Heather
"Your mother and I, we kissed.",Barney
You can catch two fish with a hook.,Marshall
"No, but I can catch a fish and use this one to catch the other.",Robin
It is Canadian! Robin is Canadian! She is Canadian.It comes not from Bemidji and she knows bugger all about the Vikings.,Marshall
"During the 1999 NFC Championship, when the Vikings lost...",Marshall
Holy shit!,All
... who was the scorer who missed the penalty?,Marshall
Rashad Tarkenton.,Robin
Gary Anderson. He is retired. It was a case of fly fishing... in Canada.,Marshall
"You know what? I'm glad you know it because I am proud to be Canadian. It was not a good NFL team or Prince, but we invented Trivial Pursuit. Anything, the Earth! In addition, in Canada, you can go to a strip club full of alcohol and order. And yeah. Moosejaw in the Bay of Fundy, you can whistle your pint of Pilsner while watching a minor girl to get naked. Jealous? In Canada, people do not care where you come from, as you are whisked away nice and possibly a cigarette, or when a donut. I am proud to come from the Great White North... and I want to be right now. And was not afraid of the dark. Finally, we do not really like, but like everyone else.",Robin
Merry Christmas. Look into it. If you push around the...Not down the middle.,Ted
I do not need you.,Heather
Got it.,Ted
You've signed the lease.,Heather
You know why?,Ted
Because you trust me and that's a good idea?,Heather
I want to know you. The new you.,Ted
Thank you.,Heather
"By the way, in your new neighborhood, you should put a good lock on your door. If you want... live.",Ted
Sorry about what happened inside. I was stupid. I should say anything.,Marshall
"I'm sorry. That was your cue. I should not have my own.But every year during the holidays, I am homesick. And so far, every year, I had a reason to stay: a boyfriend, a job or something. But... This year, for the first time, I have nothing.",Robin
But if.,Marshall
What?,Robin
"We love you all. If you ever leave again in Canada, we jump on a plane, you are pursuing, and after that Barney has dragged some of the club with which you have spoken, we will bring you here where you are supposed to be. This is not New York without Robin Scherbatsky.",Marshall
Thank you.,Robin
Yeah.,Marshall
I miss sometimes. I wish I could close my eyes and find myself one hour in Canada.,Robin
I was hoping that you say that.,Marshall
How did you find this place?,Robin
"Just like home, eh?",Marshall
There's only one way to know.,Robin
Sorry. I had not seen. Are you okay?,Man
It's OK.,Robin
"OK, I apologize. Take a donut, it's a gift.",Man
thank you.,Robin
"OK. You come home in him, he apologized and you file a donut free?",Marshall
It's like home.,Robin
Sorry! All is well! Sorry.,Marshall
No one likes the dark.,Robin
You were a member? You sing what?,Robin
"I think you will recognize. I will throw your body anyway. I will throw your body into Canada Day! Dude, you can split the screen. We know the words.",Marshall
Everyone comes to play. Take all your worries.  Let's go to the mall. Today!,All
It looks good. I'll do.,Ted
There's no more milk.,Robin
I saw in the fridge.,Ted
empty.,Robin
"So, throw it.",Ted
The trash can is full.,Robin
"So, take out the trash.",Ted
I eat cereal.,Robin
"You know, when I asked you to be my roommate, I said, A girl, she will be careful. But no, you're an ogre Revenge of the Nerds.",Ted
"You know what? Instead of coming with references typical last minute like that, you should spend some time, I dunno... washing a dish.",Robin
"Damn, I can not. I'm busy leave a plate of cookies for the elf magic puts toilet paper. Wait, there's no elf. It's always me!",Ted
"I always changing. You, never!",Robin
This is ridiculous!,Ted
"No, I went there yesterday... Stop it! Stop it! My God, what happens? When we were a couple, we lived together and we almost went insane.",Robin
I know. It's been what?,Ted
You know what this is? We made love. Men and women need sex to live together. It resolves all disputes.,Robin
As Barney's theory on world peace?,Ted
"I explained. I said, Madeline, every international conflict essentially boils down to sexual tension.",Barney
All international conflicts?,Ted
"All, man.",Barney
"So, the crisis in the Middle East could be solved by...",Ted
Gaza Strippers. Next.,Barney
Apartheid?,Ted
Apartouze. You have what?,Barney
The Cold w*r?,Ted
"Mrs. Gorbachev, removed her underwear.",Barney
"Well, I think we should love again.",Ted
"Yes, of course.",Robin
"I know. It's like riding a bike, man?",Robin
"Biking upside down. Well, listen. If it should happen on occasion, they say nothing to anyone. Sold.",Ted
Sold.,Robin
Sold.,Marshall
"You do not care what, guys? You are back together?",Marshall
No. It was just love to do more fighting.,Ted
"It's a great idea. No, really. Hat guys. I saw in the future and everything works perfectly for everyone.",Marshall
Why are you here anyway?,Robin
I was working and I had to take a leap here...reading this magazine. In... the room there.,Marshall
I understand. No problem.,Ted
"If this is a problem. You've done all the way here to read a magazine? I am willing to bet that there is a place to read this magazine at work. You know, a room with a little man on the door?",Robin
"Well, Robin. Nobody likes reading a magazine at work. You leave your office holding a magazine...",Marshall
... and the magazine says one thing and no one.,Marshall
"Hey everybody, look at what Marshall will do!Marshall will read an old magazine in the bathroom that you all share with him.",Magazine
Have you thought about maybe not reading a magazine when you read a magazine?,Robin
You have to read a magazine. That's why there has magazines.,Marshall
"So, this is wasted time.",Ted
"Exactly. And the worst part is, this piece of my hallway door to the toilet. It's exposure to criticism.",Marshall
It was my head.,Marshall
We know exactly what you will do.,Leader
The boss.,Marshall
"Eriksen, why you do not move your office there?",Bilson
"Donald I think he has a Woman. My darling, if flagrant.",Man
"Anyway, I'd rather do it here.",Marshall
"No, I'm sorry. This is our house now. Marshall, you should also read a magazine. Give me your key.",Robin
"No, certainly not. Reminds me of a bargain between three parties where no one would discuss a certain event happened. An event... persuasion. This key, madam, this is my silence. Good day to you both.",Marshall
You slept together?,Lily
"Thank you, Lily.",Marshall
"You... have slept together. What are √©pouv...stouflant. Epouvstouflant. Well done, Ted. Bravo.",Barney
It seems more important than it is.,Robin
We talked and we realized we had some difficult months.It deserves a little fun.,Ted
"No. It could ruin your friendship. When two former try the right opportunity, someone always ends in pain.",Lily
"We will not get there, OK? Nobody will get hurt. It has established rules.",Robin
Rule number one: purely physical relationship. There are no feelings.,Ted
This is like telling Fonzie be cool.,Robin
"And since it's just physical, it was not to worry love.",Ted
You can do it watching TV!,Robin
Absolutely! Let's multitasking. Use sex to spice up the boring activities.,Ted
As folding laundry.,Robin
Paying the bills.,Ted
It's not very hygienic.,Ted
"Yes, not that one.",Robin
"And now they sleep together, we argue more.",Robin
"Problem solved. In fact, the credit goes to Barney. This idea just your thing on the world peace.",Ted
"Yes. Thank you, Barney. You were right. Peace was established. More than once.",Robin
"So, I am responsible for... Excellent. Excellent.Excellent. The next tour is for me!",Barney
Are you okay?,Lily
Yes. Why you ask?,Barney
"For one thing, you cry openly.",Lily
From joy. I am so happy for them.,Barney
"Barney, admit it. You always have feelings for Robin and it tortures you.",Lily
I'm going quite well. Excuse me just a minute.  I'm going quite well.,Barney
You must learn to express your feelings. Perhaps you should see a psychiatrist.,Lily
"Wait. If I pay a woman $ 200 an hour to feel better, it will not discuss. And there will be both on the couch. The woman in my scenario, she is a prostitute. Dirty, vulgar, all redone, from Eastern Europe...",Barney
I entered.,Lily
There's something liberating not to take it seriously.,Ted
Last night we did when I answered the phone.,Robin
I knew you had not of paddler!,Marshall
"Wonderful, we still speak of that!",Barney
"Look, it's a private thing between me and Ted.",Robin
It is not even discuss it if Marshall could read a magazine at work.,Robin
"It was always like that. You remember, in law?",Lily
Sure.,Marshall
Baby? What has he?,Marshall
"The bank statement arrived today. You have booked a hotel two blocks from your school, a Tuesday.",Lily
That's not what you think.,Marshall
"It's that, Marshall? What's her name?",Lily
Burrito. Carnitas Burrito.,Marshall
Have you booked a hotel room just to read a magazine?,Robin
You do not want me to see if the waitress at a huge scale for this haughty tone with you? Nobody likes reading a magazine at work and they say they are not human.,Marshall
"Dude, I read a magazine at work every day. I will not say how many meetings where I was late because I 'was reading a magazine.  But I'm not ashamed of that. This is my moment. Sure, magazine is read is not sexy, but you know, this is something I have to do. Why be ashamed? Wait, read a magazine that's wank, right?",Barney
I think so. You still have drank all my milk!,Ted
We can make love.,Robin
OK.,Ted
"This is the ideal plan. Each time you start to yell, he lieth in place. One minute you're on the back of each other, and the one after that, well, the same thing.",Ted
Super.,Barney
"This morning, she cried through the door, You're too long in the shower! . A second later, she joined me. There, it has not bothered me to take my time.",Ted
If great.,Barney
"Sorry for the delay. I was typing a Scherbatsky. She used all my stamps, so in short, the postman rang twice. Should you stamp it!",Ted
It's... just... if... Excuse me one second.,Barney
"So, plasmas are better in low light, but the LCD is best to play?",Barney
"Okay, but CRTs have the deepest blacks.",Seller
So if I want a very good contrast ratio...,Barney
The deep structure of the CRT pixel resolution produces unrivaled in LCD.,Seller
I take the CRT.,Barney
"Barney, it's crazy.",Lily
"I'm fine, thank you.",Barney
"No, it's wrong. You must learn to get it out. As we did in my kindergarten class. The time for emotions, every Tuesday morning.",Lily
"Look, maybe your kids resent their friends sleep together, but not me. I have never been better.",Barney
"Listen all, big breakfast this morning. You know what that means.",Magazine
Are you aware? They fired everyone in the eighth.,Woman
I know. This is a ghost town there.,Man
Hello.,Ted
Hello.,Robin
It was fun last night.,Ted
"Sure, it was a good one. Personal memo: leave it lying around the pizza box more often.",Robin
"Okay, see you later.",Ted
"Last night, Robin left a pizza box lying on the floor, so we had sex three times.",Ted
OK.,Marshall
And this morning before leaving for work... we kissed.,Ted
Bizarre. It's weird.,Marshall
What? This kiss has violated the spirit of our arrangement. She probably thinks that I have feelings for her.,Ted
Do you have any?,Marshall
"Yes, I love it. That's what... It's you, man.",Barney
No. It meant nothing. It was just a reflex when we were a couple. But I did everything go wrong.,Ted
Clearly. This is the end.,Barney
Wait. Maybe she has not found it weird.,Marshall
"It was weird. Bizarre, weird, weird. B-I-R-A-Z-R-E.Bizarre.",Robin
That's not how it is written.,Lily
"Come on, Lily. Do not your Ted.",Robin
"I warned you. When ex relapse, ultimately, it hurts someone. But nobody is listening. This is the story of my life.My nice face that prevents people listen to my message.",Lily
What do I do?,Robin
"A single solution. You must stop sleeping together, please.",Barney
"I think we should stop sleeping. Ted and I, it's like cigarettes. You take one into thinking it is good. And very quickly, you buy one carton per week. I must stop it.",Robin
I have to stop it.,Ted
"So, you stop that, huh?",Robin
I think so.,Ted
"This is for the best. It was fun, but I do not want it becoming weird.",Robin
I do not either.,Ted
Colocs?,Robin
Colocs.,Ted
But they say nothing to anyone. Okay?,Ted
Sold.,Robin
Sold.,Marshall
Dude!,Robin
Seriously!,Ted
What is your problem?,Lily
It did not last long.,Ted
"Actually, what you did not care for us? I thought you had the perfect plan.",Robin
That was the case.,Marshall
"Everything was going well. I felt more and more comfortable, more confident. I could conquer the world. One morning I'm in the eighth with a magazine.",Marshall
The celebrities extend their clothes? I also extend my machine.  Do not enter!,Marshall
It did not last long.,Marshall
Thank you.,Barney
What are you doing?,Ted
"Because of your bickering roommates are always a source of conflict between you two, I wanted to help. In fact, I went to the post. I took you stamps. In about 10 000. That should be enough.",Barney
"Thanks, I guess. You want a beer?",Ted
I took it in passing. It's nothing.,Barney
You have bought us a dishwasher?,Ted
It has always been there. You've been here how long?,Barney
"So you take it all and you can avoid to argue, eh?",Ted
Exactly. I worry about you.,Barney
"It bothers you that we sleep together, right?",Ted
Not at all. It's crazy. What?,Barney
You're in love with Robin? You're in love with Robin.That's why you not want people sleeping together.,Ted
What? You say anything. A friend can not clean the apartment of another friend like friends do?,Barney
Cite me a buddy in the story of friends who has already done that.,Ted
I give you two: Clean and gentlemen Solcarlus.,Barney
That thing between me and Robin is completely innocent.I flipperai if you tell me not feel something for her. This is the case?,Ted
"No. This is not true, no. This is not true, no. No. Robin is all yours, man. Exploding yourself with it. Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go sleep with other girls.",Barney
Are you sure?,Ted
Yes!,Barney
Positive?,Ted
Absolutely. ,Barney
"And I went with a bang. Why did I do that? It comes perhaps my father issues, but... basically, I allowed my best friend to sleep with the girl of my dreams. I completely sabotaged. And now, I smoke. I smoke.",Barney
Get out of here.,Lily
"But it's time and emotions I Emotive, bears sharing.Whoever Emotive, Bear's shares, can sit on the chair of the division.",Barney
"Barney, you're not at your therapist. These children also have their problems, you know. Ben's parents divorced.",Lily
Really?,Ben
Who wants to do the coloring?,Lily
"Great, it's Lily who sent you? I have not the bear, OK?I will make it! Why are you smiling?",Barney
I just... reading a magazine. Here at work.,Marshall
What?,Barney
"It's the funniest thing. I was on the net, looking at hotels when I realized something.",Marshall
This is stupid.,Marshall
"I decided it was time to face my complex and do what I had to do and once that decision, everything changed.",Marshall
That's a young man at ease in his sneakers.,Woman
I know what you are about to do and I respect you for that.,Man
Well the road.,Bilson
"You have taken a big step today. Remember Shakespeare: Virtue is fearless and goodness, without fear.",Magazine
"You're right, Super Babe Are My Woman Stop telling me Why You Are Not Famous But I stop To forget. Let's do it.",Marshall
Watch the road.,Magazine
Congratulations.,Barney
Thank you. I would have done well at some point.Sometimes you have to... You have to say and... go there.,Marshall
"Marshall, I gotta go. In fact, there are toilets here, if you want to use.",Barney
... Species,Marshall
"Ted, I must tell you the truth. I love...  tacos. What are you doing?",Barney
"I go step-louse. If you are looking for Ted, he was released. And... our little arrangement is... completed, by the way.",Robin
Really? That's Wife... vantable.,Barney
Epousvantable?,Robin
"Yes, it is √©pousvantable. What has happened?",Barney
He insisted. He said no longer able to do if it hurt someone. I think we all know who he is talking about.,Robin
Oh?,Barney
It's not obvious?,Robin
It is?,Barney
Yes. This is Ted. You know how it romantic. He can not separate the physical emotion. It is kind of...,Robin
I love you.,Barney
"Right. It's not like you, you know? In addition, we are friends. I want to complicate matters by committing. Hanging out with friends never works. So... you want to go eat a taco?",Robin
A Taco?,Barney
"You love them, right?",Robin
Just.,Barney
"Come on, I'm hungry.",Robin
Fort Lau-ger-Dale! Get it?,Lily
Minne-Cider! Get it?,Marshall
Aspen Yards Ale! Get it?,Lily
"Actually, no!",Marshall
I do not either. I was hoping that you find.,Lily
I will not get it.,Marshall
What?,Ted
Lily not want me to take a taxi to the airport just to get a taxi in the opposite direction.,Marshall
But the thing of the pack?,Ted
"It was fun when we were younger, but we exceeded it. When mature, the relationship matures with us.",Marshall
"But... you are an inspiration to us all, you are so dedicated and linked. I look at you, and that's all I want in the world.",Ted
"There are two students out, and they look easy!",Barney
Arizona... You know... I always wanted to see what looks like a license in Arizona.,Ted
I already did that. 21 years.,Barney
It's good. God thank you. What brings you here?,Ted
You have a group? We will perhaps see you.,Ted
Excuse me one second.  What is your problem? We will not see them play.,Barney
Why?,Ted
"If you go see them, it is not better than blondes showing their tits at a concert by Van Halen.",Barney
"Yes, but these girls they sleep with Van Halen after?",Ted
"If you want to sleep with Van Halen, do it on your spare time. We're not guys who-could-come-you-see. It is the other guys, those older, who ever came and whose recognition is required.",Barney
We are their fathers?,Ted
"Exactly.  This is a great meeting, I think that we can come. Another time, girls.",Barney
"If you want to see us afterwards, we can exchange our numbers.",Ted
Excuse us a minute.  Have you gone crazy? We do not want their numbers.,Barney
I know not what I was doing. I had panic there.,Ted
"Qua na you exchange a number, you give him the opportunity to call to cancel. If you give a number without an appointment, they must come. Checkmate! No number, just my fingers. Truck.",Barney
You're still their father?,Ted
Why not arrange to meet you here tomorrow night to 22h.,Barney
"Whatever happens, we will be there.",Barney
That's all ski account.,Ted
Sorry one last time.,Barney
What is the problem here?,Ted
Well done.,Barney
Thank you.,Ted
At tomorrow night.,Barney
"'Definitely. Great! Dude, these students seem stupid.",Barney
Bluntly.,Ted
"Awesome. Here's the thing: tomorrow night, dress up well, it will move!",Barney
We would still have had to make their numbers.,Ted
"You always imagine the worst. Ted, I promise, everything will be okay. It begins to snow.",Barney
It's really bad outside. They will not.,Ted
"But if it will come. It has to. If I can touch one of those girls, I get a Bingo party student. Come on, Ted. You're the only one here.",Barney
"Sorry, a Bingo party student?",Ted
"Every year, Playboy publishes a list of the best student parties in the country. I take the top 25, and I do... a bingo card. All I need now that Arizona Tech, which is crazy. In a contest, it would be given automatically.",Barney
How many people are on this festive bingo student?,Ted

No! It is only 21h.,Ted
"And it rocks here, yo!",Barney
"I'm really sorry, but I have to install beds in the church. It becomes a refuge, snowy nights.",Carl
selfish bastard! There are two cannons girls who come to us here.,Barney
You can leave it open a little more? We monitor everything.,Ted
You two? Impossible. You ignore the low bar.,Carl
Serve the g*n first?,Barney
"That's the key. Once your girls arrive, you turn off the lights and close. I want to go back and find a mess here.",Carl
Seriously?,Ted
I can trust you.,Carl
There should be a bar.,Ted
"Of course, we should have a bar!",Barney
You really should have a bar.,Ted
It really should have a bar.,Barney
Our bar would be great.,Ted
"And dude, dude, dude, dude... The name of our bar will be... Puzzles. People will, Why Puzzles? That's the puzzle.",Barney
"That's... a great name for a bar! And also, Puzzles: no nightcap.",Ted
No nightcap!,Barney
"Except where everyone ended up spending the best night of his life, then we put the chairs on the tables and pulled out the margarita fountain.",Ted
There should be a bar.,Barney
There should be a bar.,Ted
I can jump as far.,Marshall
I'm going to recover.,Ted
I can trust you.,Carl
You? Great! I'm coming.  Ranjit?,Lily
I'm Rachel Sondheimer.,Woman
"One moment, Lily. IF you get off the plane, which is Marshall? And the pack of beer?",Ranjit
That's the problem. I must be Brunivers in East Meadow in one hour.,Lily

We are the band of hens fighting Arizona Tech.,Melissa
"Come on, Chickens!",All
"Dude, Carl is going to k*ll us if we turn not everyone immediately. I'm serious. He promised not to mess. Okay, you score a point. The bar is open! Who wants a beer?",Ted
"I always find it silly. What happened to when you grow up, the relationship matures with us?",Robin
"It's just something Lily read in Psychology. It's good, she read in Cosmo. Okay, I read in Cosmo. Well, it was in Cosmo Girl. Drive, OK?",Marshall
Why make a fuss a little ritual is abandoned.,Robin
"It's more than that, OK? This is our little rituals. You know what we did when I got home?",Marshall
I do not wanna hear about f*ck like rabbits.,Robin
They told what they had eaten at noon.,Marshall

BTI... Too much information.,Ranjit
You know what I miss? The call for lunch.,Lily
"Baby, it's lunch and I love you.",Lily
"No, I love you even more.",Lily
"Do we get a room to pull all this out? It seemed like a good compromise, although I have to work my positions. I love you too.",Marshall
"Now, when she calls, I let the answering machine.The answering machine!",Marshall
How dare you?,Robin
What I miss most is the kiss of midnight New Year,Marshall
It was New Year's tradition But you know what we did this year?,Lily
Kiss like rabbits?,Ranjit
No.,Lily
"All of these little rituals, nice, cute... This is stupid. Say what we ate? They look like kids playing in the dinette.",Robin
Maybe you think it's stupid because you've never had a relationship that lasts long enough for that.,Marshall
What?,Robin
You know nothing of love. You're like a robot that someone would cry and say that... Why this human leaking?,Marshall
Really? Okay... Robot mode station-you-on-the-aisle-in-waiting-for-excuse-of-the imbecile.,Robin
My robot was... a thousand times better.,Marshall
"FYI, the sink overflows into the bathroom.",Man
There's no sink. And you get out of the kitchen.,Ted

"No nightcap!  Puzzles, Barney here.",Barney
"Well, you're still there. I arrive in 5 minutes.",Carl
Last glass.,Barney
A snowplow arrives. We must leave.,Marshall
"You think being in love, it's just to have pet names. Or let the words stupid or darken in the blizzard for no reason.",Robin
You know what will happen?,Marshall
"You know what you are? You're a snob of love. There's lots of ways to live a relationship, you would know if you left your little club Snob love.",Robin
"We'll be buried under the snow, that's what will happen.",Marshall
Nothing to be done. I will not sit here and insult me.We're not going to the airport. We go.  It's been what?,Robin
It was earlier called for the drink of Seattle.,Lily
"You did well to call. I was close. It's the perfect storm outside. It was only in 2009, when the storm of the century, it is perhaps a little premature. Let the storm of the year. Even if one is in January.",Man
"It is rather a hurry, so we'll take the beer.",Lily
You are a cute couple.,Man
Thank you.,Ranjit
We're not a couple.,Lily
God thank you. It would have been weird. Here it is.Supersonic Tonic.,Man
No. It is a drum. I want a six pack.,Lily
That's all I have.,Man
You take the barrel.,Lily
"What? No. The last time I had one in the car, I ended up removing the dried vomit on the seat with a kn*fe.",Ranjit
"Sorry, Ranjit, but it is a ritual, and I back this beer. If you could put it in the car. I'll give you $ 50.",Lily
A car.,Ranjit
"Robin, I'm sorry. You're not a robot. If you are, you are a very advanced model, and the human race has no chance. You did not choose to show your love through rituals tacky, and that's good. But maybe we did that because we have always done and we know no other way. What I know is that if there sitting alone at the airport, I have to go get her.These are the rules.",Marshall
Close your eyes.,Robin
"I know not how you thought I draguais you, but...",Marshall
"Do it.  Now, go find your wife.",Robin
"Okay, go. You are not obliged to return, but you can not stay. I always wanted to say that. I mean, in a bar. I say all the time with me.",Barney
"One day, we should have a bar. And when it will, there will never be nightcap.",Man
We said no last drink. We must do.,Ted
We should do what? Carl will be there from one moment to another.,Barney
We can do one thing.,Ted
"Caring for a bar, it's boring. We should stick to what we know.",Ted
We should start a band.,Barney
Of course! Why was not yet formed a band?,Ted
Where is she?,Marshall
Seattle.,Robin
What?,Marshall
His flight was canceled. He has never taken off.,Robin
She would have called me and...,Marshall
"Baby, it's me. My flight was canceled because of a snowstorm and I will not fly until Thursday, I'm still stuck here for two days. It's lunchtime and I love you.",Lily
I still think it's stupid.,Robin
"It not return until Thursday. It was all the way here and not return until Thursday. I feel stupid. Listen, they say nothing to Lily about everything, OK? Especially the part where thou dredges.",Marshall
I've not dredged.,Robin
That's it.,Marshall
"Dude, I do not believe that you've ever done this far.You'll have to go back and redo all that way again tomorrow.",Ted
The whole thing was a sign. Let us end this ancient ritual. I will not get it.,Marshall
Robin you really dredged?,Ted
"Dude, that was weird.",Marshall
"Guys, this festival is great! You are true friends of Hens fighting. If necessary, do not hesitate to ask.",Man
The flute section does she see anyone?,Barney
You're not really looking for it?,Ted
Really.,Marshall
"So, on New Year's kiss, calls for lunch, all... I ate it today, you're really going to drop it?",Ted
"Yes, really.",Marshall
"A muffin, a pastrami sandwich, and chips. I know that lunch is over, but I love you. I love you Lily, more and more each day. Happy New Year. That means I have to bring a band at the airport now?",Marshall

You got more fans than I thought.,Lily
And only 60% of them are prisoners.,Ted
"These guys think what? I am far from my phase dating a prisoner. It's like: Hi, I am over 19 years.",Robin

It's terrible. And bad... also.,Ted
It's not over.,Robin
"Arise, New York. Trust. Recycle. Exit covered.",Robin
Leave covered?,Marshall
"I will not be a presenter at Channel 10, right?",Robin
It just fell.,Barney
The problem may be your CV. Have you seen like mine is ventilated? Yours is too busy.,Ted
"As if everything on your resume is so important?Program Director, Radio Wesleyan University?",Robin
My God.,Marshall
Dr. X? You always talk to Dr. X?,Lily
Who is Dr. X?,Robin
No one knows. It was a mysterious and awesome DJ.,Ted
It was Ted.,Marshall
His identity is still secret.,Ted
It was Ted.,Lily
But this phantom waves changed the face of the campus radio.,Ted
It was Ted.,Marshall
The show was zero.,Lily
"Here Dr. X, b*ll*ts of truth from an undisclosed location. For if I knew where they would silence me.",Radio
"You're the 3rd floor of the home student next to the playroom, dork.",Marshall
I received lots of letters for my story on the menus of r*cist school.,Radio
"How do you receive mail if someone knows where you are, moron?",Lily
"This is why I organize an event to the self, Monday at midnight. It is time that leaders of the canteen remove ignorance and injustice menus.  Ted, we are missing a player. What are you doing here, anyway? Dude, get out of here! I'll be right. Remember, self, Monday, midnight. Another event Dr. X. I'll be there, because X leaves its mark...",Radio
"If you think people liked your show, it's wrong...",Marshall
Bizarre. Look at what is mixed with your fan mail.,Barney
What?,Robin
It comes from the Ministry of Immigration.,Barney
The postmark date of two months. My God.,Robin
What has he?,Lily
"My work permit. If I can not find a job in the coming...seven days, they will refer me to Canada.",Robin
I can not believe you that turns the country.,Barney
I know. My whole life is here.,Robin
No. We will not let them. One of us will help you find.,Ted
"Yes, I'm sure I can find you something at school.",Lily
"No, guys... it does not work like that. Robin will have its license if it works in his field. You could stay if you got married to a U.S. citizen. Yes, it might work. No. The procedure to formalize it would take too much time. It will not work.",Marshall
I'm screwed. I send my demo for 3 months and nothing.,Robin
"Maybe there is something in it that people do not like.We'll watch it, OK?",Ted
"Good question, Norm. For the first, I was an intern for Channel 22 in Red Deer. Alberta. In Canada. The snow falls hard enough, but these intrepid fishermen are still happy to contribute to the gathering of bass fishing Lake Athabasca, a tradition of 1 August To you, Norm. What? It was my first job. It shows where I come from.",Robin
"Unless a bear attacks you in 3 seconds with your legs and you break his neck, it has nothing to do in your demo.",Barney
"No, no, I understand. Your origins are part of what you sell. Moreover, in 'Special jurisdiction' on my resume, I put that in Minnesota, I was dunk champion Nicollet County in 1995.",Marshall
You've put champion dunk in your CV?,Ted
"Yes, why not? Many companies have a basketball team. They like that TonnerreVanille can still crash into the net.",Marshall
We called you TonnerreVanille?,Robin
"Yeah, TonnerreVanille. The ghost of snowshoes.The gate man. I was not very good in defense.",Marshall
You can dunk more.,Ted
"Bine sure if. Finally, I could... until there is little.",Marshall
Until the injury.,Lily
It's tendonitis of the iliopsoas.,Doctor
"Wow, it's scary.",Lily
More commonly known as the dancer's hip.,Doctor
Go! Iliopsoas tendinitis. This is the name. This is the only name.,Marshall
"iliopsoas tendinitis. It's a basketball injury. Finally, nothing incredible.",Marshall
"The dancer's hip, Marshall's ax dancer.",Lily
"OK, no. They call it like that because it is very common among ballet dancers.",Marshall
"Tell me, other girls in your class have the dancer's hip?",Robin
Sure.,Marshall
I have a technical question. Is it easier to dance when you do not have external genitalia?,Ted
"Well, go ahead, feel free to me.",Marshall
"Come on, guys. It did not hurt while dancing.",Lily
"Thank you, Lily.",Marshall
"Obviously, the stirrups were too far apart during his last visit to the gynecologist.",Lily
"Folks, sorry to stop you before Marshall falls into tears, but Robin, check it out. What you need is a super video resume. Like mine. I present to you: Barneysvideocv.com. Hello. Barney Stinson, you have achieved great successes in business, sport and personal relationships, and have been an inspiration to many people.",Barney
Is that you? You INTERVIEWED yourself?,Ted
How could that be me? He is an Englishman. What would you recommend to your many admirers who want to reach the peak of their potential?,Barney
And a little Scottish.,Ted
"The first thing to know about success is that it will not come to you. Most people associate success with money and power, but in fact it is a mindset.",Barney
You were supposed to be on a motorcycle to say that?,Ted
"And when it comes to success, the only limit is that there is no limit.",Barney
You know you stand next to a horse. Impressive.,Marshall
"Barney, I do not understand. You doing anything in these clips.",Lily
"Exactly. Because that's what the world wants to work.People who seem to take risks, but never do anything. In fact, you do things will turn. I write a book about this phenomenon.",Barney
Really?,Marshall
"No, it would be... You listen? All my life I have dared to go beyond the possible. Until the impossible? In fact, beyond that... where the possible and the impossible meet to become... the possimpossible.",Barney
The possimpossible? Oh yeah?,Lily
"Inventing your own word shows creativity and vision...Visia-ness. If I can leave you with one thought, is this one: nothing... and all... is possimpossible.  This guy is awesome.",Barney
It's you again...? You sing a song about you?,Ted
"Absolutely not. It would be stupid. Stinson, Barney Stinson singing this song, it would be really stupid. One of the fans who think this guy is awesome. Perfect and available.Great, Great, Great, Great, Great, Great... Great, great. Barney Stinson, committed. This jewel has earned me 11 jobs.",Barney
Impossible.,Ted
"Barney, it was ridiculous and foolish.",Lily
insensate-ule.,Marshall
Make me one.,Robin

"Now, we talk about it.",Barney
What? I will be deported. I would try anything.,Robin
"OK, we should get started. I have much to sh**t, I can not use the tapes I have of you.",Barney
Bands on me?,Robin
Let's start.,Barney
Honey. You're always sorry for the joke of the dancer?They joked. We all know that this is a basketball injury.,Lily
"Yes, absolutely. I have something to say.",Marshall
What?,Lily
I dance more than you think.,Marshall
What?,Lily
I dance... more than you think.,Marshall
I do not know how to answer that.,Lily
What does it mean to be a reporter for you?,Barney
Since I was little...,Robin
"Cut! You're mired in details. We need you to be vague, at ease with buzzwords like synergy and dynamism. You can invent a word, as... Relationality.",Barney
How does make me feel stupid commit somewhere?,Robin
"All right. Do not do it. There are many exciting stories to cover in Canada. I just read it, the nephew of the mayor of Winnipeg went fishing on the ice and took a pole of 7 Kg Live from the worst place in the world, I'm Robin Scherbatsky.",Barney
Rotate the camera. Connectitude.,Robin
I like it.,Barney
Transformatation.,Robin
Come on!,Barney

"relationality, this is mine.",Barney
How many dances are we talking about?,Lily
I know. I think... I would say... average.,Marshall
"Why do you dance much, and I do not know why?",Lily
"I do that when I'm alone. When something good happens, and I'm excited and move, and I... I dunno, I want to talk about it.",Marshall
You hurt the hip like that?,Lily
You're aware of? They give us half a day. One can start at 14h.,Man
"Super! Thank you, Herm.",Marshall
"These clothes are ridiculous. In addition, the armor of the amazon princess itch.",Robin
"Showdown. You're not the first to wear it here. But it expresses the power. And that, too. Now, I need you break these 15 bricks with your forehead.",Barney
What? But you do anything in your video. You were right next to a horse and sitting on a motorcycle.,Robin
I am a man. You're a woman. Assume that you can do nothing. You must prove that society is wrong.,Barney
I can not break 15 bricks with my forehead.,Robin
"There is more in 1950. Yes, you can.",Barney
I'm off.,Robin
Why?,Barney
It will not help me find a job. I'm going to evict. I know what to do.  This is where the auditions for the daughter of lottery?,Robin
And the lotto numbers for tonight are...,Robin
And the lotto numbers for tonight are... 17...,Robin
17.,Robin
Disillusioned? On the 17th?,Robin

As a vaginal rejuvenation?,Ted
You know who has not made a lot of vaginas in college?,Marshall
Who?,Ted
Dr. X.,Marshall
It was perfect!,Ted
"You know what? The two geniuses are going to remove that crap on their CV. You're not Dr. X, and you can not do the dunk. Forget.",Lily
Marshall and I are the only ones here with shit on our resume?,Ted
What are you insinuating?,Lily
"I know! Does July 4, 1995 does remind you of anything?",Marshall
A species of bastard.,Lily
"End! And the new champion with 29 hot dogs, Lily The Belly Aldrin.",Referee
What it's related to your job as mistress?,Ted
It teaches kids... I can eat a lot of hot dogs very quickly.,Lily
"Yes, but you can not!",Marshall
"You can dunk over, hip cardboard!",Lily
How dare you? These hips can...,Marshall
Guys!,Ted
I have not even been taken as the daughter of lottery. I must leave Canada.,Robin
I think so.,Lily
I remember the night before. They made me a farewell party. They gave me a camera to take pictures and send them home. Everyone was sure I will have much success. You will really miss.,Robin
What's the matter?,Barney
Robin must leave Canada.,Ted
"Oh, my God. It's horrible. It'll be along to commute.",Barney
What do you mean?,Robin
I've finished your video resume myself. I posted it to all channels of the city. A guy called from Channel 8. He adores you. He wants you to pass an audition.,Barney
My God!,Robin
I said no. Robin Scherbatsky do not audition. He is given the job or anything.,Barney
"So, I have the job.",Robin
"No. He cursed me and hung up. But after Channel 12, called. They'll love it too. They offer you to host their new talk show in the morning.",Barney
It's amazing!,Robin
I sent them shit.,Barney

Look. Three beautiful blondes drinking bad decision juice at 8am.,Lily
Pretty radar chest. This is my wife.,Marshall
"No, I must go.",Barney
Seriously? They are blond and stuffed. This is not your type?,Lily
"Maybe I did not like. My God, you think that the male spirit is really so simple, we all have a favorite type? Lord.Asian, big tits. I go to the bathroom, then I'm going.",Barney
You noticed that Barney is weird lately?,Lily
"Actually, yes. You know, he never gives flowers to a girl, because living things remind babies?",Ted
Yes.,Lily
"The other day I saw him in a flower shop on the 82nd, he bought roses.",Ted
What?,Robin
"Now that you say, Barney did something weird yesterday at the office.",Marshall
"OK, to Saturday.  I was thinking of a brunch, and perhaps a hike. I love you too.",Barney
"I thought he was talking to a girl he just wanted to jump. Or Ted, but now I know more.",Marshall
You think it is possible that Barney Stinson has a girlfriend?,Lily
A plus.,Barney

Nice to meet you. I feel I already know you. Barney can not stop talking about you every day.,Loretta

"What's that, Barney?",Robin
"It's a long story. As you know, my father had to leave my mother when I was a baby because he became presenter of the Just Price.",Barney
Very good program.,Robin
Bob Barker is your father.,Marshall
"She had to raise my brother and I, all alone. And his only wish was that his son did not end up alone like her. And there seven years, she fell ill.",Barney
I do not think she was going to make. So I decided to fulfill his wish. Mom. This is Betty. We're engaged.,Barney
I hired an actress to play my girlfriend Betty. His real name is Margaret. It is mainly small theaters. Superb actress.In it a Moliere. I say no more. This is political. I should not talk about it. But there is a problem. Betty has a slight tendency to improvise.,Barney
"You see, Mom? I found someone who makes me happy. As you wished.",Barney
It's beautiful. I wish I could stay for small children.,Loretta
I'm pregnant!,Betty
"And then my mother went better. It was miraculous.But I had to keep Betty and make a casting to find my son, Tyler.",Barney
It's crazy. Did you actually cast your own son?,Lily

"four, eight... thirteen, you stay. The other, you can leave.",Barney
"You said if I slept with you, my son would have the role.",Woman

And that's how the role of Tyler went to... Grant.,Barney
"Come on, Grant looks pretty good.",Ted
Really? Look. Tyler? Tyler? Tyler? Grant?,Barney
Yes?,Grant

It sounds like your mother kept your child's room as you had left.,Lily
It's a huge Karate Kid poster above your bed.,Marshall
"Karate Kid's a great movie. This is the story of a young karate enthusiast whose dreams led him to Karate Championship All Star Valley. Unfortunately, he loses in the final against another loser. But he learned an important lesson in accepting his defeat.",Barney
"Wait. When you watch Karate Kid, you are the wicked little blonde?",Lily
"No, I'm for the other loser from New Jersey who barely knows karate. When I watch Karate Kid, I'm for real karate kid: Johnny Lawrence of Cobra Kai dojo. Do not get dumber than you are, Lily.",Barney
"I just remembered where I know you. I saw you play at the theater of disorientation, Die heilige Johanna der Schlachth&amp;ouml;fe by Bertolt Brecht, last fall. You were a revelation!",Ted
Really?,Betty

"Hey, Santa, do you think we can take off with this weather?",Boy
"Cut! Cut! Grandpa and Grandma will be there in half an hour, and you always skinned my words. I feel like I'm going to write, direct and play this thing. Give me your elf hat. Sit down.",Ted
I always wanted to be an actor. It is this kind of dream that flies away with time.,Ted
"Look, if you want, I can give you advice as an actor.",Betty
Really?,Ted
I would love. Rule number one player...,Betty
At least one person who still loves to play. I miss that.,Grant
You do not like playing the son of Barney?,Robin
I hate. But what can I do? I get no phone call.,Grant
"I know what it is. I am a presenter. But I had to accept a job on a morning show that starts at 4:30. I thought evolve much faster than that, you know? I'm almost 30 years.",Robin
"Come on, you're still beautiful. I love your new nose.",Grant
I have not had surgery.,Robin
That's it. Neither do I.,Grant
I can not believe that there has never met you. Who knew that Barney's mother was so great?,Lily
"Thank you, darling. Actually, I was not so perfect a mother when I was younger.",Loretta
Do not say that. I'm sure you were great.,Marshall
"Yeah, I was rather a drag.",Loretta
I'm sorry?,Lily
"A drag, darling. A dirty streak. I am not proud. But...Finally, I had fun. There's no pleasure as intense as... to watch a guy in the eye and say, I do not know your name, and you either, but... the next eight minutes we're going to flinch foundations of this gas station toilet.  Then to proceed in opposite directions. And just drive.",Loretta
Barney Mom? Loretta.,Marshall
"Finally, all this is history now. I did the best I could, but... Sometimes, I wonder how Barney was able to become so perfect.",Loretta
"You must tell the truth to your mother, OK? Listen, this is a nice woman, loving, a little too direct that deserves better.",Marshall
"No, no question. The truth would k*ll her.",Barney
"I do not feel well to the idea of lying to a woman so warm, OK? It reminds me of my mother. What?",Marshall
"Warm? Remember to marriage, I said we would be together forever? On our return down the aisle, your mother leaned over and said, Not forever, darling. Marshall will go to heaven. ",Lily
She was joking.,Marshall
"She hates me, Marshall. But that's okay, because...Forget.",Lily
You're going to say what?,Marshall
Nothing. You want to go do it again in the bedroom of Barney?,Lily
On the bed race car?,Barney
"The handles are great. Listen, Lily, if you learned something today, is that honesty is important in a family.Whatever your feelings about my mother, we've been together for 12 years, baby. I think I can handle it.",Marshall
Really? I hate your mother.,Lily
You know what? I hate you!,Marshall
"In two minutes, meat loaf!",Loretta
Meatloaf? Tyler to love!,Tyler
We talked about it a million times! You get no slogan!,Barney
But it's funny.,Grant
I can make another cast. Will remember your sentences for the big dinner scene.,Barney
Wait. You wrote that we will have dinner?,Robin
Just a little script. Things that my mother will be pleased to hear.,Barney
What kind?,Robin
"And I really thought that Barney had forgot our anniversary. So I rushed into the garden, smoke coming out of my ears.",Betty
The nostrils dilated. They do it when she gets mad. I love it. As now. Like now!,Barney
You better stop!,Betty
"Sorry, my little bear. Continues. You really like that for a relationship.",Barney
"So I go out raging in the garden, and... candles everywhere... and a string quartet. You come to believe?",Betty
"No, not at all.",Lily
And my boy Ty-Ty. What's new?,Loretta
"Funny story, the other night, this little rascal had a nightmare. He came to tell us what it was, you remember what you said?",Barney
Well...,Tyler
Page 4...,Barney
The dinosaur bones at the museum have come back to life and chasing me?,Tyler
"Thank you very much, man. Tonight I will not sleep.",Marshall
"Tyler said: In my nightmare, mom and you did not know how much I loved you. So I'm here to say it was great...like that. ",Barney
It was cute.,Loretta
We're a happy family.,Barney
I will take a little ice in the freezer downstairs and make the ice creams in the kitchen.,Loretta
No weak link in this scene. Bravo!,Barney
"Come on, Barney. You have no idea of the difficulty of getting a job beneath you. I really liked your tip on the bones of dinosaurs.",Robin
You can stop with that?,Marshall
Go and eat your ice.,Barney
I can not. I'm lactose intolerant.,Grant
Guess who is not lactose intolerant: Tyler. Tyler will go there and enjoy every bite.,Barney
It's time for ice!,Loretta
Yum!,Barney
My God!,Loretta
Tyler dislike.,Tyler
You're not gonna get us out a slogan.,Barney
I do not understand.,Loretta
"I, yes. Follow me. I... been betrayed by my best friend.How could you do that, Ted? Think of the poor Tyler who tries valiantly to hold back tears. It's good my boy, you can cry.Weep!",Barney
I do not want my mom and dad divorced!,Tyler
What can you have to say for yourself?,Barney
Rule number one player: Do not be afraid to improvise.,Betty
"Is it I who betrayed, or that you have betrayed me?",Ted
Sorry. What?,Barney
Rule number 5 player: Invent a rich backdrop for your character. ,Betty
"November 14, 1998. The night train to Monte Carlo. I was in the car pool arnaquant Algerians few thousand dinars, while thou s√©duisais my bride! Who is blind and took you for me.",Ted
"For God's sake, what are you talking?",Barney
Rule number 8 player: Do not be afraid to come to blows. ,Betty
You know not well what I mean?,Ted
"No, not at all.",Barney
"Of course I do! And for sure I'll hear you admit it, manure!",Ted
"Mom, you leave us a moment?",Barney
There was chocolate and caramel. There are lots of kinds of noodles and marshmallows.,Loretta
You've lost your mind?,Barney
You were amazing! You really become that character.,Betty
"Honestly, I played a really Ted, I tried not to be him.",Ted
What's wrong with you? How do I explain this to my mother?,Barney
It may be time to tell him the truth.,Lily
"I know. Sometimes, honesty leads people to say bad things about the woman who always took care of me because I was the runt of the family. For God's sake, I'm just a 92 m!",Marshall
How were my tears?,Grant
"Perfect. You see? Even in a role that you hate, you manage to love what you do.",Robin
It may be like that in your new job.,Grant
You think so?,Robin
I know.,Grant
"Thank you, Grant. You're pretty smart, you know that?",Robin
We are sorry! I thought something was happening.,Grant
"Honey, you okay?",Loretta
"Mom, I've got something to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. Tyler is dying. And Betty said that when he is gone, it will go out. So it may soon be over.",Barney
My God!,Loretta
None of this is true! The truth is that... Betty and Tyler are actors I hired to pretend to be my family.,Barney
What?,Loretta
"I just wanted you to think I had the life you wanted for me. I wanted you to be proud of me. It sounds crazy, and I'm sorry, Mom.",Barney
"Well, Betty is not your wife?",Loretta
No.,Barney
thank you God! I do not like this woman.,Loretta
Really?,Barney
"Yes. And Tyler... I know I am his grandmother and I'm supposed to love him, but I hate him. Tyler not love! What does that mean?",Loretta
Is it not?,Barney
"With your fake friends over there, I wanted to sh**t myself.",Loretta
"I know! They are not horrible? So really, you angry with me?",Barney
"I'm confused. I do not know why you thought having to do that. I love you, perfect family or not. I love you, no matter what.",Loretta
Really?,Barney
Really.,Loretta
"I'm really relieved because in reality, I am also far from being a married man can be. My stories with women you would shock and horrify you.",Barney
Whatever. I love you always.,Loretta
"Seriously, you can not imagine what I could do.",Barney
"When you were 3 years old, I left you with a babysitter and spent three weeks with Grand Funk Railroad, from one guy to another like a bang.",Loretta
Mom!,Barney
"Promise me one thing. If ever you meet someone special, do not run away. Do not like me. Take a chance, okay?",Loretta
The taxi is here.,Robin
I'll try.,Barney
"And I just wanted to say, if I was never cold or distant, I'm sorry.",Lily
Who speaks it?,Robin
My mother.,Marshall
It mean a lot to me if we could be closer.,Lily
Breathe loudly as if the result would be hard to say. I love you.,Betty
I love you...,Lily
Mom...,Ted
... Mom.,Lily
Do like I was nice.,Betty
"Do like I was nice. I mean, it's really nice of you, Judy.You too. See you soon.",Lily
"That I understand that. You tell me when you watch Karate Kid, you're not in San Daniel?",Marshall
Nope!,Barney
Who do you like in Die Hard?,Ted
"Hans Gruber, the villain class. At the end, it is trapped.This is the title character.",Barney
"OK, and Breakfast Club?",Lily
The teacher who is watching. This is the only one who passes the whole movie in a suit.,Barney
I have one. Terminator.,Robin
"What is the title, Robin? Who among us has not shed a tear when his small red eye goes to the end and he can not k*ll these people? Sorry. The film...",Barney
I'll watch the film again with you.,Ted
They even try to help!,Barney
"Hello, everyone.",Robin
So you do really? You really gonna go to work at 2am.,Marshall
I do not for me. I do it for the fans.,Robin
Who is a fan of a program broadcast at 4am?,Marshall
Those with a show at 5am?,Lily
The addicts who have not sold their TV?,Ted
The strippers in this weird time between work and waking the children?,Barney
They are. Put me know. It's been what?,Robin
"You know, as usual.",Marshall
"Really, as usual.? Think the funniest thing that ever happened.",Barney
It's good.,Robin
And twice that.,Barney
So a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos?,Robin
Something even funnier happened to Marshall today.,Barney
"First, nothing is funnier than that. Then it's not such a good story.",Marshall
"Come on, guys. You are four young people active in the most exciting city in the world. And you have nothing to tell me?",Robin
What do you want? Sometimes it's like that. The same thing over and over again. One of my students ate glue.,Lily
I have used questionable methods to skip a very silly girl.,Barney
"My ex, Karen, is in New York. The usual routine.",Ted
Karen is here?,Lily
You're kidding me!,Barney
I like you live in a dorm. It's so American. Like eating rotten sandwiches and be r*cist.,Karen
"My God, it was a real idiot.",Lily
"Dude, the gold medal of the andouille de Vire.",Marshall
It was not that bad.,Ted
"Of course, for you. You had it turned into a zombie of andouille.",Lily
"I want to eat your brain, but only if it is organic and free range.",Marshall
What?,Ted
You pass me the salt?,Lily
The salt? It's so bourgeois.,Karen
Bluntly.,Ted
What is this?,Karen
It's... a TV.,Marshall
I not watch TV.,Karen
Bluntly.,Ted
You thought I would buy tickets to WrestleMania? It was ironic.,Karen
Bluntly.,Ted
This makeup has one month to go. I met with parents of Lily. I have never looked so stupid.,Marshall
"So far. Tells the story, tells the story!",Barney
Get off me!,Marshall
Wait. It's really funny?,Robin
"I'm not kidding. I almost do not want you to hear, because really, for the rest of your life, nothing will ever be as fun and you, curse you for agreeing to hear. You gotta hear it.This is too funny.",Barney
Okay.,Marshall
This morning I was in the gymnasium of the box to play basketball. The guys from work can be quite violent with their taunts.,Marshall
Look Wisniewski. He will cry. Look at him.,Bilson
Look at him.,Man
I think that the knees are made to bend like that. He may have torn his cruciate ligament.,Marshall
"Dude, all that he has torn, that's her uterus or maybe her hymen.",Bilson
"Yeah, or the fallopian tube.",Man
"I can be a bit watered down dialogue, whatever...",Marshall
I searched my bag to get my stuff working...,Marshall
Wait. Expect. I want to say.,Barney
Okay. Say it.,Marshall
"He searched his bag to get his stuff, and... No, say it.It's more fun if you say so. Let me say it. No, say it. You say.Say it. At the same time. No, go ahead.",Barney
I forgot...,Marshall
He forgot his pants!,Barney
He forgot his pants.,Barney
"He forgot his pants. It's pretty funny. Less than a chimpanzee wearing two tuxedos. I mean, he... he forgot that he was already one? Moron, the monkey.",Robin
"So, Karen in New York. Bizarre, no?",Ted
You can not get back with Karen.,Lily
I never said I'd do that. I thought it arrives. That would be the worst disaster if I called?,Ted
"It is not the worst, no. That would be the fourth worst.1: Super volcano. 2: An asteroid falls to Earth. 3: Any record of Evel Knievel is lost. 4: Ted called Karen. 5: Lily is eaten by a shark.",Marshall
"My name is Lily and I approve this order. You know the story. Ted and Karen had a rocky relationship in college. It always happened like this. They were having fun, being obnoxious until one day...",Lily
"You find pepperoni fascist and you're so right, so...  Oh, my God! Karen!",Ted
"Sorry, dude.",Man
"Before you say a word, I think you should read Les Fleurs du Mal by Baudelaire.",Karen
"After that, they broke. Ted was totally depressed, and we waited the necessary time to tell him what we thought of it.",Marshall
I broke up with Karen.,Ted
They hated it!,Lily
"Bye bye, the slut!",Marshall
Then Ted went up the noggin and took the bus to Providence to tell Karen's four truths.,Lily
How was it?,Marshall
Super. Look who's here!,Ted
"And finally, all over again from scratch.",Lily
"It's gonna be 10,002 Maniacs, because I have tickets to Natalie Merchant...",Ted
"Sorry, dude.",Man
"She came to see you in college and when you had my back turned, she brought the guys in your room?",Robin
Respect.,Barney
"I was an idiot. It was my first real girlfriend. I was crazy about her. We've all done things we regret in college. In the third year, Marshall has grown the goatee, wearing a beret and Rasta required to be called MJ Cool.",Ted
I regret it at all.,Marshall
So you really think that I should not call?,Ted
No.,Robin
Go back in your little head it.,Marshall
"OK, OK. Interesting information: it is already done.",Ted
Are you kidding!,Lily
The pants!,Barney
I can not believe that thou hast called. Why do not you invite him to lunch as you're at it?,Lily
Because I will not invite him to lunch... again.,Ted
You have to lunch?,Lily
Why do you want to lunch with an ex?,Marshall
"Good question, there are four reasons for a meal ex '.1: They want to get back together.",Barney
"As my high school boyfriend, Scooter.",Lily
"The Lilium, not stupid. Sorry, I have no scooter for you.",Lily
This is super funny! I forgot your humor.,Scooter
It is this server?,Lily
"Why? You like the servers? I can be a waiter. I will become the best server in the world, and you'll love me!",Scooter
2: They want to k*ll you. As my lunch with Wendy.,Barney
"Happy is that way at last. You know, after you have rejected nine times, I almost drop.",Wendy
"But you did not do it, you've continued to insist.",Barney
"Actually, there is one thing I wanted to give you.",Wendy
g*n! She's got a g*n!,Barney
It's a tie!,Wendy
3: They make you really want your business.,Barney
As my lunch with Curt.,Robin
"Actually, there is one thing I wanted to give you.",Curt
"My short-barreled 38 Special Police! I knew that I had left it somewhere. Every time I watch the news, I pray it is not my g*n.",Robin
We did well to break.,Curt
Or four: You taunt with their success.,Barney
As my lunch with Nicole Barsamian.,Marshall
Who is Nicole Barsamian?,Robin
My ex.,Marshall
"Hi, Nicole.",Marshall
You look good.,Nicole
You look pretty.,Marshall
I see someone.,Nicole
Already? Who?,Marshall
Lee Roberts. He already reads like a CM2.,Nicole
You must cancel the luncheon.,Marshall
"I'd do that, of course... if he had not already occurred.",Ted
"Robin, I will have to borrow the butt of your g*n.",Lily
I still lost. You come to believe?,Robin
How can you break bread with this chick?,Lily
It was a lunch and not eat wheat. It was nice to be back.We even laughed at the idiots we were.,Ted
Say I had a beret different every day.,Karen
Say I had a picture of Moliere on my backpack.,Ted
It was pretentious.,Karen
Bluntly pretentious.,Ted
What would you like?,Waiter
"I want to make a scene, but in your list of wines, there is a Chateauneuf-du-Pape listed under C&amp;ocirc;tes de Provence.You should tell your waiter.",Karen
And for you?,Waiter
"I hate change, but take us brushettes and fresh mozzarella. Grazie.",Ted
It was great. There was an odd moment near the end.,Ted
"How to say goodbye in these situations? A kiss on the cheek, too familiar. A handshake, too formal.",Robin
And a hug is like a hug in public.,Barney
You must embrace strangely.,Marshall
What has happened?,Lily
So...,Ted
"Schopenhauer had a discussion daring, in which he opposed...",Karen
"Ted, darling. Go outside and bite the curb. I arrive in 1 minute.",Lily
"Karen was the first girl I really loved. And after the year I had, I dunno, I think of lunch with her reminded me what it was to turn 18 and life ahead. And I would remind everyone that at least I was wearing pants.",Ted
You can not change the subject like that.,Marshall
The pants.,Robin
The pants! The pants!,Barney
"It was nothing! I had a small problem, so I called Lily.",Marshall
"Tell us, what was this concern?",Barney
I forgot my pants.,Marshall
What do you mean you forgot your pants?,Lily
I forgot. You have a bringest me.,Marshall
And the spare.,Lily
"Last Thursday, the mustard? You have a goldfish memory.",Marshall
"Ted, you're not going out so easily. While the history of pants is fun...",Lily
"Fun? Rather, very fun.",Barney
That's nothing compared to this crazy thing with Karen.Ends.,Lily
That's all. It was just a kiss in a restaurant.,Ted
Why do you say the restaurant? You've embraced elsewhere?,Lily
"As in a tree? No, it was not done in a tree. What is his problem?",Ted
You did what?,Marshall
How could you?,Barney
"Marshall forgot his pants today, and yet you are the stupidest in this table.",Lily
"Lily, let's be honest. We know both your motives. You hate Karen because she lingered.",Ted
assh*le.,Lily
What do you mean by linger?,Robin
"February 5,... In 1998. I painted...",Lily
"I'm sorry. Sorry.  The color palette is a bit derivative of the first Van Gogh, right?",Karen
"Ted Horn, critique my painting, anything, that's your business. But I catch you eyeing the mess of my guy and you lingered? You'll be received well.",Lily
The game is the game,Robin
"In his defense, I had just the muscle.",Marshall
Why paint naked?,Ted
"He had eaten my fruit bowl. The fact is that Karen is a dirty pervert, you can not bring into our lives.",Lily
"Relax, it was just one night! And three after. And one morning. But at least I had pants. Even if, in fact, I had not.",Ted
It happened to us? Where was I?,Robin
You know the sleeping pills you take for your crazy schedule? They are stronger than you think.,Ted
Do not worry. I will say nothing to Marshall.,Robin
I'll have a beer. You want one? A beer. I decanted Bordeaux.,Karen
"Ted, that's for sure, it's fun to look back when you were a farm girl fresh complexion and a virgin. But all that stuff... Ohio, Karen, in college... it was A.S. Before Stinson. Now your life is great! Okay, you still live with your ex, which is ridiculous. Laser tag your k*ll are almost nonexistent. And your wardrobe, it's like, what, you're allergic to fabric quality?Seriously, pull yourself together. What are we talking?",Barney
What is the result with the bimbo?,Robin
"It's a foregone conclusion. Ted is Charlie Brown trying to sh**t and Karen, it's Lucy who takes away the ball at the last second and sleeping with. You have understood me.Ted falls in love, and Karen is going wrong with a playboy, who says... Sorry, dude.",Marshall
"False! You got to let the right answer in your pants, because that's exactly what did not happen.",Ted
My God. How could you?,Man
"Sorry, dude.",Ted
That was me. Me. The one time Marshall forgot his pants?,Ted
"Damn! Stop changing the subject. You have gone too far. You are complicit in breaking the heart of this poor guy.And you, you are best placed to know how it feels.",Marshall
You really do speak of your pants?,Robin
What?,Marshall
"Pant, pant...",Barney
Okay! Lily came to the office to bring me my pants...,Marshall
Why she did this?,Barney
Because I forgot.,Marshall
"Lily, what are you doing here?",Barney
I just give something to Marshall.,Lily
He give something. Understood. Nice.,Barney
But I'm in a hurry. I can give it to you?,Lily
"Of course, yes.",Barney
And you give him?,Lily
Wait. I do not know. Yours had better be really good.,Barney
What are you talking?,Lily
What about you?,Barney
"Marshall forgot his pants, so I brought him one.",Lily
"He forgot his pants. Good thing you came because today it has an important meeting, and it would be embarrassing and not at all funny if it were to show no pants. I will make sure he has.",Barney
Awesome. Thank you.,Lily
And you did not give him.,Ted
"Theodore Evelyn Mosby. Of course I gave him. I gave him my word. It is concrete. For cons, I made a few alterations.",Barney
As you can see on page 44 of the contract...,Marshall
Since when you are in AC / DC?,Bilson
You can look at page 44 of the contract?,Marshall
Auditions for Oliver Twist are down!,Man
"Please, can I have more... pants?",Barney
More...,Barney
Is that all? It's the story?,Robin
What has happened to Karen?,Marshall
"I'll finish for you. Ted left without saying anything, and Karen got exactly what she wanted.",Lily
Not this time.,Ted
You have a boyfriend?,Ted
It's a moment you move away. I intended to break.,Karen
"You're unbelievable. You do not have the guts to break up with someone decent. So, you've preferred to ride it all.",Ted
"OK, you're right. I'm good in literature. Gifted in art.Good at identifying a French wine for less than a kilometer from where the grapes grew. But... I'm really bad to watch someone and say what I feel.",Karen
We're both zero for that. But... I think we need to change.Why do not I would start? You are really hurtful and reckless.Goodbye.,Ted
"Ted, wait. In fact, good bye means until we see each other again. So I guess you mean that in fact, we'll meet again?",Karen
"Sorry, dude.",Ted
I am impressed. For you too have worn it all day?,Robin
It shows my calves.,Marshall
The pants. Still tells.,Barney
"You know, this is perhaps good that you called Karen.",Lily
"Of course. And that for me, too. Later, she spoke with Jerry, and the discussion was that it avoided breaking with me.",Ted
Wait a minute. You said that you never reparlerais him?So how do you know she has followed your advice?,Lily
"Right. On this subject... After breaking up with this guy, we went out, we slept since we're together. It's really okay, this time it's different. Here it is. Be nice!",Ted
Hi all.,Karen
Hi.,All
"Sorry, can not stay.",Ted
It's unfortunate!,Barney
Disgusted!,Robin
They are real diamonds?,Karen
"Yes. Yes, absolutely. Thank you.",Robin
I did not say that I loved.,Karen
I got a great deal...,Robin
I'm sure that minors exploited in Sierra Leone you would type in five if they still had their fingers. But it's nice.Meet me at the top.,Karen
They need a finger to do what I think.,Robin
"Ted, Karen is an idiot.",Marshall
Nice set of forms.,Ted
I put the forms there.,Marshall
"Believe it or not, my friends do not have a say on which I frequent. This is my life. I decide.",Ted
Now!,Karen
I arrive.,Ted
"I do not know what it is, this shrew. Okay, she has boobs, but... In fact, I see.",Barney
That's because he met her in high school. This is his first girlfriend.,Lily
"For us, Karen is an idiot. For him, this is the first to have touched his penis in hand himself, his mother and pediatrician.",Marshall
It's almost 2am. I must work.,Robin
"How can they call it a daily? 4h, it's still the middle of the night. You impressed me.",Lily
"It's been almost a month. I'm used to. And then the show is not bad, right?",Robin
That is clear.,Marshall
I've never seen.,Barney
You've ever watched?,Robin
Sure!,Marshall
I've never seen.,Barney
Your favorite item?,Robin
Weather.,Marshall
I've never seen.,Barney
Have you ever looked.,Robin
Sorry.,Marshall
I just said.,Barney
"I know, this is basic and bland, and it is smaller audiences than the Korean channel that does that Kim Jong Il by the horse. But, friends, it would touch me to know that at least once you look.",Robin
"You know what? This Friday, everyone will come home at 3:30. We leave the pajamas and watch his show.",Marshall
You're the best.,Robin
We want to encourage you.,Lily
I just want to sleep!,Lily
I hate Robin not to have done better.,Marshall
"Hi, guys. Bad news: I was Karen plated. Go ahead.",Ted
I knew you were listening!,Marshall
"We should not celebrate. Ted has just been dumped.Tell us everything, everything that happened. Seriously, do not forget any details. She said what? You, you said what? How you going? If you had to redo it from start, perhaps you...?",Barney
How did that happen?,Lily
"This is totally stupid. We were together, you know, we laughed...",Ted
It's you who love the Chianti 2002.,Ted
"No, it's you who love the Chianti 2002. Expect. What is this?",Karen
Looks like the earring Robin. Bizarre. It's you...,Ted
What's she doing here?,Karen
I know.,Ted
Have you slept with Robin?,Karen
What? Of course not! She had to be found in the laundry.,Ted
Why I believe you?,Karen
"Maybe because I've always been faithful, when thou hast deceived me 6 times, bitch.",Ted
In your face!,Marshall
Right? I too would have said that.,Ted
Why I believe you?,Karen
"Maybe because I've always been faithful, while you... I love you...",Ted
I knew it was a mistake. It's good. It's over.,Karen
That's it. She's gone.,Ted
What a story. What courage to share it with us.,Barney
Wait. That's your pajamas? You sleep in pajamas suit?,Lily
Of course. You think I'm sleeping in it?,Barney
A coffin.,Ted
It's not look comfortable at all. You wear a tie.,Marshall
"First, it's a tie night. Second, it's not for comfort. This class is to be at any time.",Barney
Why have the class at any time?,Marshall
Let me tell you a story that happened to me recently.,Barney
"It's not an anecdote, it's a porno.",Ted
"This is not a skin flick, it's the scene... Forget it.",Lily
"But it could happen. If it happened and I was in top form for these oiled bitches, I would regret it.",Barney
"Sorry, dude, but it is the nightwear most ridiculous I've seen in my life. Finally...",Marshall
"Marshall wearing a nightgown! He wears a nightgown! You know when they say, Remember, he was wearing a nightgown? It is now! This is a nightgown. Call it, Held danger of Ninja, if you want. You stay still a tr*nsv*stite.",Barney
I do not care. It's comfortable.,Marshall
"Nice to fly to Neverland with Peter Pan? Me, again! It was nice to get out of bed to accompany Charlie to the chocolate? Oh, me, me! Something about Scrooge! Come on, guys. I do all the work.",Barney
"I know. I live with Marshall for 12 years. Every time I put something, it's a victory.",Ted
"Ted, it will start!",Lily
I arrive.,Ted
"Hello, New York. I'm Robin...",Robin
"Marshall, I found an earring Robin on your dresser. You know why the other was in my bed?",Ted
What are you talking?,Marshall
You hate Karen. You told me to break it. It's you. Did you put the loop in my bed for Karen to find.,Ted
I would never...,Marshall
Admit it!,Ted
There's nothing to admit!,Marshall
Why was it on your dresser?,Ted
It is pretty!,Barney
"I swear, if you tell me the truth on the field...",Ted
Wait! Marshall did nothing. It's me. I made you break.,Lily
You made me break with Karen? Are you sick? What right did you do that?,Ted
I did it for your own good. You do not see how it was horrible. She failed the test of the porch.,Lily
What is this test?,Ted
"You, Me and Marshall are friends since college. Imagine how they account for one another. So when I look to the future, I see us all together.  When will retirees, sipping tea on the porch of our house, playing bridge all day.",Lily
"You know not to play bridge, eh?",Barney
It will take over.,Lily
It's important to stay active.,Marshall
"So whenever you go out with someone for a while, I take the test of the porch. How that person will fit over the years?And when I think of Karen...",Lily
Karen has failed the test of the porch. She had to leave.,Lily
I can not believe you did that.,Ted
"Do you like is great, you, me and Marshall. Really, think about it.",Lily
It's pretty awesome.,Ted
"It is really great! So for that you will marry, one that will join the Team G√©niale, the bar is very high. I say that I did well, but...",Lily
You're better off without her.,Marshall
"If the angel Clarence says it's true, it should be.",Barney
"You know what? Go ahead, laugh.",Marshall
Why are you wearing this stuff?,Barney
Several reasons.,Marshall
You can not even give five.,Barney
A: You can not wear anything underneath.,Marshall
I confirm. You can cross your legs?,Ted
Two: It's sexy.,Marshall
I confirm. You can uncross your legs?,Lily
"Three: My grandfather was Olaf and he died at 107 years. Four: No elastic waistband leaving its mark around my Thanksgiving belly. And five: each night as I sleep, it's the most wonderful and free feeling in the world. I feel... as if I was flying. That's how I'm going to bed at night: happy, light. With a heart full of joy. And you?",Marshall
I have to stand still to avoid offending my pajama suit.But at least I do not wear a dress.,Barney
So you're really angry?,Lily
"I know. I mean, I guess if you get all this for Karen, then it may be better.",Ted
"I'm really sorry. I hated to do it again, but Karen had to leave.",Lily
Redo? How many times you made me break with my girlfriends?,Ted
Never! Six.,Lily
Like who?,Ted
"No one! Angie. In the second year. She used you to get revenge on her ex, and you will not see it, so...",Lily
... one day she was taking a nap...,Lily
"Creed? Oh, my God, I have to break up with her.",Ted
That's where is my CD of Creed.,Marshall
Who else?,Ted
"Do you remember this strange girl who wanted you to marry him after two months? You loved him in trouble, but you thought there anyway, so...",Lily
"Look, Ted, you're great, and it is very difficult, but I think it does not look the same. So, long life and prosperity. Or something else.",Woman
That was you? It's crazy!,Ted
"Ted, I did it to help you. You're addicted to the commitment. You fell in love with these women, even if they do not deserve you.",Lily
And if one of them was to be the mother of my children?,Ted
"If there was any chance, I swear, I would have done anything. As Victoria or Stella.",Lily
Or Robin. Or Robin. You made us break too? You made us break too?,Ted
"Stop talking to me as if I were your enemy! You know these women cry, but you have the luxury of not knowing what I know: you have these breaks tragic surely avoided a first marriage crap and very expensive.",Lily
You have made us break up?,Ted
"You do not want the truth, because deep down, you want me to watch over you. And basically, you know that none of these women would have been the mother of your children.",Lily
You have made us break up?,Ted
I did what I had to do.,Lily
You have made us break up?,Ted
Just as I did!,Lily
You made me break with Robin?,Ted
"No, it's not...",Lily
I can not believe it. I need another drink.,Ted
I feel a little breeze there. It's nice.,Barney
You think that's good? Come to the mouth of heating.It's like your bazaar was on a tropical island.,Marshall
The Little Barney says Mahalo.,Barney
"Seriously, just what is your problem? How could you do that?",Ted
I did it because I care about you!,Lily
"My God, what has happened?",Barney
You have not seen the show?,Robin
The show! Sorry. It happened something?,Barney
The routine.,Robin
Lily has just told us it made us break.,Ted
What? We do break? What does that mean? And why they wear a night gown?,Robin
A shirt.,Marshall
It's called a shirt.,Barney
"It turns out that Lily has decided to sabotage many of my relationships, including ours.",Ted
"Robin was different. I did not mean that you break, but you wanted different things and you refused to settle it. I could imagine the porch.",Lily
I do not like this scenario.,Marshall
I was just trying to make you talk about your problems. I did not know it would lead to your break.,Lily
I have a funny joke. Where you see yourself in five years? You know what's funny? Funny questions. Where you see yourself in five years?,Lily
Where do you see yourself in five years?,Ted
And you?,Robin
"Not that I want to make you say, but surely you want to get married.",Lily
I would probably get married.,Ted
You would surely be in Tokyo or Paris.,Lily
I would surely be in Argentina.,Robin
In Argentina?,Ted
"Or Tokyo, or Paris.",Robin
"We have a deadline, does not it?",Ted
My God.,Robin
"You can not manipulate people like that! I've known you for 12 years, but I've never been back!",Ted
I was not...,Lily
I want to hear!,Ted
Calm down! Let us be calm! I have a question. This is how when you're in bed?,Barney
"Come, let's check.",Marshall
"So, without you we would come out still together?",Robin
"Or you'd been together too long, and would have had an incredibly bitter break without even remain friends, and we would never become best friends.",Lily
Do not say that.,Robin
Stop cuddling! You got no right to interfere in my relationships you. You're lucky. You have found the love of your life in a dorm you turn 18. It gives you no right to play God while others are still looking for. You worry so much about who will finish with you on the porch. You know what? Keep it for you.,Ted
It is what happened to your jacket?,Lily
"Soot, breadcrumbs, placenta. You have not even registered?",Robin
"You're at home, every night, and Lily layer always with you?",Barney
"Yeah, marriage, man, unconditional love. You can wear what you want and you get laid.",Marshall
Tell me about marriage.,Barney
"Sometimes when you're married, the smell of breakfast wakes you ready.",Marshall
The coffee too?,Barney
The cafe also. Sometimes she even puts a vase of fresh flowers.,Marshall
"I love flowers. And sometimes when you're afraid of making wrong choices and you're not the one you wanted to be, what it does?",Barney
It says you're great and everything will be fine.,Marshall
It's beautiful. And it helps you to find other girls to sleep with?,Barney
"I guess. If you have agreed, perhaps. The guy had a hard day. We'll talk tomorrow. Good night, champ.",Marshall
What are you doing...  Lily rose and explained everything to me. And she gave me this for you.,Karen
"Ted, I'm sorry. No matter who you marry. I know it will be great because she will think you are. To prove my sincerity, I have prepared a surprise for you and Karen at the top. Kisses, Lily.",Lily
PS: Sorry that the envelope is opened. I read what she wrote. Marshall.,Marshall
"Sabotaging our relationship? I must admit that even setting the bar really low for judging friends, Lily really outdid themselves. Clearly, we can not see her again. I know. It's hard, huh?",Karen
"I realized that no matter what my friends think of my girlfriend, but it really matters what my girlfriend thinks of my friends.",Ted
"So, it's over?",Robin
"Yes. If you wanna be my guest, Lily is a sacred stove.",Ted
"beef pie, macaroni and cheese, butter cookie house.",Robin
Normal Marshall dies at age 68.,Ted
Thank you.,Robin
"Basically, Lily made us break.",Robin
It makes you wonder.,Ted
"If it had not been there, we always go out together?",Robin
"Maybe. She was right. We were not ready. We needed to move forward, we do our stuff. It is always the case.",Ted
"We should make a pact. If the years pass and only 40 years old, one is always alone...",Robin
Will you be my wife back?,Ted
"A girl dreams of hearing those words. A million times, yes!",Robin
"Okay, that's it. Do we must etablire rules?",Ted
Genre?,Robin
"I know. As not to become huge, that sort of thing.",Ted
Just one thing: no nightgown.,Robin
I'll never wear.,Ted
Too bad.,Woman
Wooden beams immersed in natural light from the atrium.They will love it!,Ted
"Wood? Natural light? Oh, no! It reminds employees that there is an outside world where they have family and friends. We want to crush it! You arrive in the dark, you come home in the dark. You spend your whole damn day in the dark!",Bilson
I need to hear Lily.,Marshall
Who told you to leave?,Bilson
"On the roof, a Zen garden to pray silently. In the lobby, a fountain where local kids can make wishes. The new GNB, your workplace and your home. Thank you, and.. welcome home.",Ted
"Yeah, it's Ted. No, no. I have not approved the change in plans for the new GNB headquarters, which I am the chief architect, just 30 years. Yes, I'm single and I give to charity.What is the relationship? Okay, bye, Mr. Mayor. You know it was bogus?",Ted
"Yes, and I also know that the draft of the new headquarters was abandoned last month. Nice try.",Woman
"Look at Scarlett Johansson at the Oscars. If I could get a celebrity, it would be Scarlett Johansson. Canon, talented and you do not turn as Woody Allen's father without issue.",Barney
"If I got a celebrity, it would be Lily. This is the star of my heart.",Marshall
For me it would be Hugh Jackman.,Lily
"You know, the celebrities, they like really weird sex stuff. Believe me.",Robin
How do you know that?,Barney
"It's embarrassing, but I... I came home one evening with a celebrity.",Robin
My God! Seriously?,Lily
"He wanted to do weird things with me, so I left. That's it.End of story.",Robin
"No, not the end of history. I need to know who, what, when and where. Balance!",Lily
"Please, calm down. You swallow too much air.",Marshall
"But before you poursuives, I'm flattered, but technically I'm not a celebrity. Also, one last time, the mask, it was a joke.",Barney
"Not you, Barney.",Robin
Who's who?,Lily
Now you've spun him hiccups.,Marshall
"I'll tell you anything specific. But all I will say is that he is Canadian, but you know it. And he brought home by offering to show me a single collection.",Robin
What do you mean collection?,Marshall
As you collect stamps or coins. But I say nothing.,Robin
Tell us at least the weird thing he wanted to do.,Barney
"I know not what you call it, but we have a name for it in Canada. Listen, I've already said too much.",Robin
So the mystery celebrity who collects something mysterious asked you to do a mystery Canadian sex act.,Lily
Yes.,Robin
Tell us.,Lily
I'll tell you. But only if you correctly guess the three parties.,Robin
It is simply impossible.,Marshall
Right.,Robin
I do not even know of Canadian sex act.,Lily
"You have the Sled Dog, the Lobster Trap, the Mounted Police.",Barney
How do you know that?,Lily
"Canadiansexact.org, this is a favorite.",Barney
Point org?,Marshall
Yeah. It's nonprofit. They just want to disseminate information.,Barney
"I just had a conversation strange. A woman at the GNB told me that the new tower was abandoned last month. It's crazy, right? What is this look?",Ted
It is said? It should.,Barney
No. I want to.,Marshall
There's been no light.,Barney
What's going on?,Ted
"It's time you know. A few weeks ago, Bilson called us.",Marshall
We abandon the project for the new headquarters. This recession is k*ll us. It cancels all the superfluous. And I have difficult choices to make during my semi retirement in St. Croix.,Bilson
"Dude, Ted will be devastated.",Marshall
Not if he learns his best friend.,Bilson
"Tell him, you're his best friend.",Marshall
"No, it's you.",Barney
"No, it's really you. Shhh, it happens.",Marshall
"White or Asian? You see, I hardly know him.",Barney
How are you?,Ted
You okay?,Marshall
"I'm frustrated. The least innovative thing in my drawings, Bilson cuts with a machete. I hate to depend on what kind of guy.",Ted
You should leave the project.,Barney
"It is clear, leave him. It is unworthy of you.",Marshall
It's decided. A new beginning! May the winds be with you...,Barney
"Are you kidding? They still come to turn a guy in my box.Bilson, is heavy, it is clear, but without this project, I have more work.",Ted
It's funny you mention the project. Because...,Barney
"You're super good. Keep it up, man. Your hair, your teeth are beautiful now. You shine like a diamond!",Marshall
"Thank you. I needed it. Well, I go back to work. I must insert a plank in the dark hallway of Bilson. You have understood me.",Ted
What was that?,Barney
I have an idea. The next two months Ted has paid anyway. We could not let it continue and not to tell her? He had a tough year. Let the fun a little.,Marshall
You suggest a complicated lie in the long term that implies a lot of discipline. A guy like you will not succeed.,Barney
But if I can.,Marshall
"Lie to me, there.",Barney
I have a spaceship.,Marshall
What kind of fuel?,Barney
I have no spaceship.,Marshall
"But no! Defend yourself! If someone asks, diverts it from the original lie with other lies. I show you. I have a pony.Question me.",Barney
It is what color?,Marshall
"When I was Dandelion, her complexion was of a deep hazel, unfortunately, his barn is located near a chemical plant, which contaminated water. Over time, it became a dull gray and the vet can not do anything to help.",Barney
"My God! It's horrible. Dandelion will make it? Okay...You're strong! Dandelion is not sick, huh?",Marshall
So the tour is canceled and you really have lied to me.,Ted
We did it to protect you.,Marshall
I think so. My two best friends have planted and I saw nothing.,Ted
"In Canada, it's called a snow plow Vicious.",Lily
This tower was the dream job and it went up in smoke.,Ted
"Sorry, Ted.",Marshall
I need a drink.,Ted
The poor. It's moved if I return to Canada on sex?,Lily
Not at all.,Marshall
You've been slow.,Barney
What is a Zamboni with 2 hands?,Lily
"Well, the only thing that carries the woman is skates with his hands.",Robin
Pack milk Manitoba?,Lily
"It's like the Moustache of Chicago, but the person below wearing a combi.",Robin
A Lobster Trap of Newfoundland?,Lily
"I dunno, I want to know. These people are crazy.",Robin
"Well, I decided my first proposal.",Lily
"Okay, but I say only if you find the person, the act and the collection.",Robin
"Well, I'm starting. Bryan Adams. He collects baseball cards and he wanted to make you... an oily Kayak.",Lily
No.,Robin
"Wayne Gretzky, former Hot Wheels, an Eskimo kneeling.",Barney
No.,Robin
"Kiefer Sutherland, souvenir glasses, tights and a Pancake.",Marshall
No. I would have accepted it.,Robin
"Wait. If they canceled the project a month ago, why did I go every week to see the new working group?",Ted
"Of course, you could not see you point and Bilson.",Barney
So we... invented the working group. It was enough just to gather a team.,Marshall
"You see Roy Waterman, Vice President of Venture Capital? It's actually... Roy maintenance.  I'm sorry, Roy. How would you like to make you some money?",Marshall
How far I have DESAPER?,Roy
"Louisa Mendoza, Vice President at Capital ex√©cutie, It's actually... Louisa from the cafeteria.  Louisa, I need your help, but forbidden to speak.",Marshall
I speak English.,Louisa
Exactly. This is an important secret. How do you say secret in Spanish?,Marshall
Pellets?,Louisa
"Okay. Albondigas. This will be our little albondigas. I have balls, please? Arthur and Nasmith, the eccentric genius, investment guru, it's actually... Arty the cracked one-man band of 15th Street.  Excuse me. One can argue?",Marshall
"Actually, my assistant, Reginald took my appointments.",Arty
It was completed with the group of trainees and paid $ 50 for them to look enthusiastic when you talked...,Marshall
"Reginald, next week, get me out of here.",Arty
That was one of the most inspired designs of my career. I was so excited.,Ted
"Alex Trebek, a Guardian Event√©, teddy bear!",Lily
No.,Robin
Damn!,Lily
Wait. It explains what happened to Louisa.,Ted
Good job.,Marshall
All right!,Barney
Louisa. What can we do about it? Do not like you not understand. You feel the same. After all!,Ted
"No, I can not. I am engaged to Mr. Barney. We do not care. We live once!",Louisa
"No, it's not good! Damn, you're in the working group!",Ted
Is there anything else you want to tell me?,Ted
When you played third base for the softball team GNB.,Marshall
"There is no softball team. We just rented a field, a bunch of guys together so they make you a hero.",Barney
My lap of honor was bogus?,Ted
"Sorry, we knew you'd be unemployed soon. We wanted you to feel good. Friends do that.",Marshall
Lying?,Ted
"Sometimes, yes, to protect them.",Marshall
False! Never lie to his friends. I should never have lied.,Ted
Really? And this open mic night at the Comedy Club?,Barney
"You're like me, people? Have you ever considered the amount of fish species? And... the name of these fish?Here are a few. Trout. Right? Sturgeon. I think so buddy.Salmon. I'll say it again... Salmon. Who thought it was a good idea? Bar. This guy is what I mean. Halibut. Thank you, good evening. How do I?",Marshall
Super. Very funny.,Ted
Fatal... Thursday evening for everyone.,Barney
Timeout. You do not like fish?,Marshall
It was horrible! You've just read a list of fish.,Ted
Whatever... This proves my point. You lied to me to protect me.,Marshall
"It has nothing to do! I lost one month of my life to work on a dead project. I could have spent that time to find new contracts. Instead, I'll go tomorrow morning and probably get fired. Best Screenplay, my boss yelling at me going in front of everyone.",Ted
"For me, it's called a...",Robin
A Totem of Saskatoon. It's here.,Lily
"Hello, lying bastards. No lies before I go to work to get fired?",Ted
Nice shirt.,Barney
You're the devil.,Ted
"What if we told you that you found another project to GNB, where you have to redo part of the 20th floor.",Marshall
"If it's a lie, it's really bad. And I will do what?",Ted
"This is the P.T.E. 18th floor. Basically, Bilson wants a piece like that, two floors above us.",Barney
"Wait, what is a P.T.E.?",Ted
Room for Transitional Employees.,Barney
What does that mean?,Ted
It's a place where a manager and an employee initiate a transfer of knowledge about an impending career change.,Barney
It turns people here.,Marshall
It's horrible. Why have a special room to turn people?,Ted
GNB think we need a safe place to meet new.,Marshall
It's serious there.,Barney
"Leaving space dismissal, you get into what I call the Renaissance Corridor Quiet. Here, an oval room of rest with psychological support. Right there, after the fountain of the New Departure. And here it is. Instead of a sad and gloomy cell, a protective womb... giving birth to a new life.",Ted
I love.,Bilson
Really?,Barney
"Good job, Ted.",Bilson
Thank you.,Ted
You can add these keys to the PTE the 18th floor?,Bilson
Absolutely.,Ted
Awesome. 'll See about that.,Bilson
"OK, I think this wall...",Ted
You're fired!,Bilson
What?,Ted
"I wanted this piece! This same room, two floors up!",Bilson
But...,Ted
"You're fired! Away from here.  Hi, honey.",Bilson
"Anyone of Rush, a Meat Pie from Montreal and a lunchbox superhero.",Lily
No.,Robin
"Rick Moranis, the Reverse Rich Moranis, of Jewish antiquities. I give up. It's been three days that I seek. I stop. If that means I could ever be.",Lily
Well.,Robin
Tell us about it!,Lily
You really want to know?,Robin
But this info does not leave the table.,Robin
My God. I am so excited.  I will read.,Lily
Read it.,Barney
Read it.,Marshall
"I will read it. Let's go. The Frozen Snowshoe, Old King Clancy, The Plateaux of Harvey.",Lily
So?,Robin
I do not understand any of these words.,Lily
One of them is supposed to be famous?,Barney
Who the hell... The Old King Clancy is?,Marshall
"This is not the person is the sexual act. It's like the Sacramento Turtleneck, but with maple syrup.",Robin
"And fame, this is Harvey L√©plateaux?",Marshall
"No, it's the collection. Harvey trays. These orange trays they give you when you eat at Harvey. Restaurants? Will you take a trip on the Trans-Canada Highway, you have a hollow between Milverton and Wawa, where you stop eating, eh? At Harvey. More than 12,000 customers!",Robin
So fame was...,Lily
"The Frozen Snowshoe. Oh, my God! You know Racket jelly? This is the most famous pro wrestler of Canada. I met him after his victory over Rick The Daredevil at the Rogers Memorial Arena in Kamloops in 2002. A classic.",Robin
"So you say you Racket Jelly invited him home to show you trays of Harvey, and you've asked him to do an Old King Clancy?",Lily
"Right. And I'm serious, do not tell anyone.",Robin
My hiccups are gone. Perhaps forever.,Lily
You again. You even found a way to spoil it. Why?Why let yourself do we as a country?,Barney
"Hey, Mister Whisper. You should not be up there to draw your super PTE?",Marshall
I'm more about the project.,Ted
What?,Marshall
Bilson fired me.,Ted
You're kidding.,Marshall
What does that mean for your company? You're going to be fired?,Lily
"Actually, I just resign.",Ted
Why?,Marshall
"I can not work for large corporations with no heart. In selling me your working group, I was the most inspired work of my career. In fact, you reminded me how my job could be fun when I'm not dealing with Bilson, so... I resigned.",Ted
"They've turned, eh?",Barney
"Yes, sir. But I have good benefits and I have made a great decision. I'll start my own box.",Ted
It's exciting.,Lily
With this economy?,Barney
"So, do we want it?",Marshall
"Ultimately, I am grateful.",Ted
What was it with Bilson?,Barney
"After he proposed a career change, I made an impromptu presentation with a four-step approach that put him in the knee.",Ted
You've hit with a chair?,Barney
Yeah.,Ted
Well done.,Barney
"That one, I got to the restaurant between Milverton and Wawa.",Man
"It's very impressive, The Frozen Snowshoe.",Robin
We're friends. Call me racket. Sit down.,Man
So... Snowshoeing Would you like me... Old King Clancy one?,Robin
You should go.,Snowshoeing
You believe not what happened last night laser tag.,Barney
People freaked out because of a calibrated in suits who bothered their children?,Ted
"Yeah, almost.",Barney
Go! You want that!,Barney
My shoulder!,Girl
Come on.,Barney
"Stinson, in my office! Now!",Pattern
Shit.,Barney
"Foul Play, three stampedes, and now this! Stinson, you are a ball!",Pattern
"I know, I'm not your precious rules, McCracken, but, damn, the results are there!",Barney
"Listen, you're a good player laser tag. Perhaps the best I've seen. But someday, you will hurt someone.Maybe even you.",Mccracken
You forget what it's there. Your fat ass is stuck here for too long.,Barney
My pleasure. Do not do that. This game is all I have.And I nearly enough tickets for the remote controlled helicopter. Pity.,Barney
"I can not believe I do that. But I'll leave you one last chance. But be aware, if you exceed the limits of a toe, you play the duck sh**ting in your mother's so fast it will make you dizzy. Get out!",Mccracken
You regret it.,Barney
"It's over, Stinson. You are banned for life!",Mccracken
I can not believe you're kicked out of laser tag. Are you gonna do?,Marshall
What shall I do? I'll tell you that Ted and I will do. We will introduce and apply the PQ everywhere.,Barney
"Barney, you're too old to put toilet paper because you can play laser tag more. And by the way, too old for laser tag.",Ted
"Ted, laser tag has no age limit. As the striptease in the West Midlle.",Barney
"Yeah, whatever. I added laser tag to the list of Murtaugh.",Ted
No list of Murtaugh.,Barney
What is the Murtaugh list?,Robin
"... two, one, chug!",Marshall
"It's hard to admit, but with age, we can do certain things.This is why I have this list, not to make the mistake of thinking that I can still make a sleepless night.",Ted
I'm too old for this stuff.,Marshall
Or eat a whole pizza in one sitting.,Ted
I'm too old for this stuff.,Marshall
Or put posters on the wall without a frame.,Ted
"Riggs. I'm too old for this stuff. In fact, it's Lethal w*apon?",Marshall
"I know. It looks pumped. An old cop associated with a young and rebellious. It reminds you of anything? Mackleroy and LaFleur. Do not tell me you have never seen Mackleroy and LaFleur. This is the best action movie of all time Canadian. Mackleroy is a young Mountie whose horse is k*ll by evil Americans, and LaFleur, his old partner grumpy and Afro-Canadian, just buy a nice fishing shack in northern Alberta...",Robin
I gotta go.,Marshall
"Hi, baby. Good workout.",Lily
What? It's still one-man band? Because it was crap.,Robin
My God! Orange wedges. That's nice. What are you doing here?,Marshall
I could not resist. I wanted to see Marshmallow coach at work.,Lily
"The children, who wants to stop earlier and eat orange slices?",Marshall
Yeah!,All
"Yeah? No way! Oranges, it's for the winners, and you little shits, you have not yet put one basket! Shame on you, shame on you Miss Aldrin, and worse, necks make me ashamed! Enough! su1c1de, on the line! And make it snappy!Here we go.",Marshall
"There's nothing on this list for which you're too old. In fact, if you did everything on the Murtaugh list, I would call it a nice weekend.",Barney
"Barney, you have more 18 years. If you did the whole list, you would die. It was not a challenge.",Ted
"Challenge accepted. The next 24 hours, I will do everything on the list. And after that, you go to the PQ laser tag with me.",Barney
And if you fail?,Ted
I'll spend three hours listening to you talk about architecture.,Barney
"It works for me. Robin, you do the honors?",Ted
An agreement of honor!,Robin
"Come on guys, you do it!",Barney
Are you sure you want to do that? You know how it is.,Robin
"There's some pretty hefty on the list. Finally, do you really think Barney is going to get ear pierced?",Ted
"To pierce the ear. Done. Well, I go to a laundry at my mother.  Do you mind if I use your futon?",Barney
There is no futon.,Robin
"Put it there, guys.",Barney
What's the matter?,Robin
It's on the list. Landing on the futon with a friend rather than going to the hotel. ,Barney
I'm too old for this stuff.,Robin
You got anything in your ear? It looks like the inside of a pumpkin after Halloween.,Ted
"What, this? Just a quick foul '. Just a kid like me has to worry about. Then, pushing a medical on the list.  Hold on. Bar here...",Barney
"It is not stop! You know, it's funny, I came to teach them... Do not stop running! All this time, it is they who have taught me things.  you not being there! You fall!",Marshall
Done.  Drinking shots with strangers. Done.,Barney
"OK, Barney? You seem to have a bad back.",Ted
"No, it's just the raver's hump. I like it. It brings me closer to my glass. A youth!  You should have a straw?",Barney
There's a side admirable in its way to remain young.Who wants to be old?,Robin
"This guy. Life is a meal and old age, the dessert. I get so many worries about the future. Where will my career? Who will I marry? When you're old, you do not worry, because all this has happened before. You got pumps and a comfortable seat for the stairs. That's perfect.",Ted
"It's not perfect, it's pathetic. You can not skip to the end.The best thing is the journey.",Robin
"I thought that, too, you'll understand when you grow older.",Ted
"Marshall, you can avoid the attack today?",Lily
"I will not attack, Lily. I attack this pervasive culture of failure. I have to toughen them if you want to win the match tomorrow.",Marshall
Winning? There are no points.,Lily
What?,Marshall
There are no points.,Lily
"You not count... What interest not to do? How do you know... Lily, what were you doing with the team before I arrive?",Marshall
I was training.,Lily
That's my little angels. You are luminous beings of light.,Lily
What's the score?,Boy
Gender: joy joy!,Lily
"Because that's the point of playing, having fun.",Lily
"The point of playing is to win the trophy. And if you do not know who wins, wins the trophy?",Marshall
"Everyone. This is a participation trophy, everyone has one.",Lily
Everything that's Chinese to me.,Marshall
"Hi, this is Barney.",Barney
And Robin.,Robin
We can not answer because...,Barney
He watches football and I'm...,Robin
"Part shopping. Leave a message, you are reminded...",Barney
... soon...,Robin
... we...,Barney
"Making an autoresponder message to two annoying.Done. It will probably cost me a few appointments, but it's okay.",Barney
Your ear begins to feel.,Robin
It's good.,Barney
"I hate to refuse, but you told me that the turkey was extremely thin, and see for yourself.",Ted
Okay. It's good. You have your own list.,Robin
What?,Ted
A list of things that you are too young. Do all these things and tell me if you still want to be old.,Robin
"Removes colonoscopy and sleeping with an old, and is a cinch.",Ted
"New bet, then. If you can finish your list before me, we will cover the laser PQ and you pay toilet paper.Biodegradable and not this crap. I want up there forever.",Barney
"Well, if I finished first, it's six hours of study of American architecture from the early 20th, and you can not ever do something in the list of Murtaugh. This is for your own good.",Ted
Bet held.,Barney
An agreement of honor!,Robin
"Marshall, they were in kindergarten. It teaches not basketball like that.",Lily
Sure. I learned that way.,Marshall
Are you kidding? What kind of sociopath told you like that?,Lily
"Come on, Dad. I'm tired.",Marshall
Sleep is for the winners. You go to bed when you get labeled.,Father
I'm trying.,Marshall
I give you two points for trying. But I take off two points because of your big head.,Father
"With my father, no mercy and I did not ask. I really need to call this guy. Continue stretching!",Marshall
Put on reading glasses. Done. Yelled the boy from the neighborhood. With pleasure.  What happened to you?,Ted
I just had a little screw up my knee and it hurts incident.,Barney
How did you do?,Ted
It... Helped to move the sixth floor walk against pizza and beer.,Barney
Or you helped steal the sixth floor. They were in a hurry and left the pictures.,Robin
16 pm! Supper time.,Ted
"Your father was hard on you. It's ugly, but you do not have to be like him. You can learn from mistakes.",Lily
"Errors? Lily, result. The guy was successful. He taught me to be a winner. This is what I teach these kids. And besides, this is what I will do with our children.",Marshall
"OK, enough. This is not how we will raise our children!And that's not how you gonna lead this team! In tomorrow's game, if you're anything but a teddy bear with the cotton candy and rainbows, I foudroierai gaze so hard that you bruise! The times I've found your internet history, it was a mere side! Is that clear?",Lily
There are different...,Marshall
Is that clear?,Lily
"Yes, ma'am. What is ironic is that...",Marshall
Ted Calls. I want to go.,Barney
Okay. I call it. But it is 4:30 am. It will not be awakened.,Robin
Got up at 4am... Done.,Ted
It answers?,Barney
I have not called yet.,Robin
"Hurry up, Robin.",Barney
Okay. Take time to answer the phone. ,Ted
"Come on, Ted. I was given aspirin and I do not think it was.",Barney
Done.,Ted
"I know I was a little hard on you, the last two days.And I apologize. Today, we will not think of victory. We'll go there and... have fun.",Marshall
"Let them score easily. Now you're sitting. Great.Addison is not football. Do not sh**t! Unless you find it funny, in this case, have fun though. It was not a foul, referee?",Marshall
"I'm no referee, but Kenny. And watch your tone.",Referee
"No tone, Kenny. Good job. Thank you very much.See you later.",Marshall
"As a manager, I threw in the towel. This bet is over.Your ear looks like a Danish pastry in a French breakfast.",Robin
"No, he remains a. The beer funnel. ",Barney
"It happens. I found these weird Russian beers, in the basement.",Ted
The Russian beer? I will take a bierofski. Bierofski. Got it?,Robin
"Yes, it's... a little hot. I hope this is not a problem.",Ted
"No, no. Okay. You won, I hate it. I hate it. My back is k*ll me. At the rave, I was mistaken for a cop. I have an earache so I can hear... I hear my own ear. Think about it. My clothes... What... Take that! I have redeemed you your best costume for twice its price. This is... $ 30. And throw the shoes. You won, Ted. I will not make anything of the Murtaugh list. I'm too old for this stuff.",Barney
"You know, yesterday I went to bed at 20h because it was on the list and I could not sleep... because it was 20h. So I watched Lethal w*apon.",Ted
"I still could not sleep, so I watched Lethal w*apon 2. And then 3. And in the middle of Lethal w*apon 4, I realized...",Ted
"... that Murtaugh kept repeating: I'm too old for this stuff, but every time he says, he changes his mind, made another movie, and stuff. What I'm trying to say is that... the toilet, age.Will cover the PQ laser tag.",Ted
And then the hospital.,Barney
"Good job, guys. At least, there are no points, eh? No idea of the score. It could be 53-0. It could be something else.It's 53-0.",Marshall
"What are we doing wrong, coach?",Boy
"You do not do anything wrong. It's great that you lost, because in life, no matter the effort you make, or how much you try, people give you things. Since graduation, jobs, promotions. No matter what you do on the ground, as... As you're having fun.",Marshall
Do not look at me like that.,Lily
I take it anymore! Your coaching is crazy!,Marshall
Stop yelling at me!,Lily
I'm sorry. But is what I can do it my way?,Marshall
"OK, but I'll do it my way too. With the guitar.",Lily
There is a werewolf on the ground! It can not be legit.,Marshall
"They look different, the children, but make sure they feel surrounded.",Lily
"It was not a market, right? You're k*ll me! You k*ll me outright!",Marshall
"Attention, coach, or I put a technical foul.",Kenny
I beg you to put me in one.,Marshall
I understand that you like it not.,Lily
I love it. I worked hard. It's nice to be appreciated at its true value.,Marshall
"I know, baby.",Lily
Your way is perhaps not completely stupid.,Marshall
Thank you. Yours is.,Lily
My great... you cause me problems since you joined this club. But damn... if this is not the best battle of PQ I've ever seen. You are returned... And right away.,Mccracken
Really?,Barney
"Good God, no! I call the police! Major cons with pink hair that dangle from the PQ. Are you kidding. I'm too old for this...",Mccracken
I heard a joke at work.,Barney
"Come on. She will not like it. It's funny for the guys, not girls.",Ted
"It's sexist! When it's funny, it's funny. Lily's cool. She'll love it.",Barney
Do it yourself.,Marshall
Tell it.,Lily
Ready? What is the difference between jam and Nutella?  It's funny.,Barney
For the guys.,Ted
She will not like it.,Marshall
Why do not I decide? What is the difference between jam and Nutella?,Lily
"Yeah, I can not hang out with you.",Lily
Come on. It's funny. This is...,Barney
I told you so.,Ted
She'll be back.,Barney
Thank you. And thank you for letting me use the apartment.,Ted
"Yeah, sure. Anything you want.",Robin
"A little thing, do you mind to cut off the TV during labor?",Ted
It's not work!,Robin
"Sorry. It's just... I can not concentrate during the Wheel of Fortune... A penny saved is a penny, Helen!",Ted
"I know you're nervous, but we must stop procrastinating. You've spent two days to choose the pen official Mosbius Designs.",Robin
I've suggested! I removed the felt. I make fun of that? The felt is back.,Ted
You know for layoffs?,Barney
"Yes, I know. I tag. Are you worried?",Marshall
"Are you kidding? I know one thing about this company. I will never be fired. It is likely that one day I was stranded on a beach with no footprints or teeth, but I will not fire.",Barney
I would like to have your insurance.,Marshall
You just gotta find a way to make you absolutely critical.,Barney
I work harder than anyone in my division.,Marshall
Keep your job has nothing to do with being a hard worker. You need something.,Barney
What do you mean something?,Marshall
"You know, something that makes you funny and loved, as Marcus Denisco.",Barney
I brought donuts. They are probably stupid.,Marcus
Chow-man!,All
Who wants pork barbecue? Of course you want!,Marcus
I love Chow-man. They can not fire him. You know what I like about Chow-man?,Marshall
It's always food.,Barney
It's always food.,Marshall
You see? You need it. You need that thing that makes you a man.,Barney
I have this thing that makes me a guy. Maybe even a guy and a half.,Marshall
"Not this stuff. You know, something. Toy-like man.",Barney
"Bad news. As HR, I must review the new overtime policy with you. The good news is that we will do with Wolverine's claws!  Section 5A: doing overtime will no longer be paid double.",Toy-man
That's great!,Marshall
Claw tape!,Barney
I love Toy-man.,Marshall
You see? You need something. Youtube-like man.,Barney
You're right. I need something.,Marshall
But choose wisely. You want to become the horrible man Massage.,Barney
You filled it. Grub-man has a panna cotta in his office.,Barney
"Hi, Douglas.",Marshall
You're so tense.,Douglas
"I was relaxed, two seconds ago.",Marshall
Welcome to Mosbius Designs.,Man
Who are you?,Robin
"PJ, the assistant of Mr. Mosby.",Man
What's going on?,Robin
Sorry. You do not interrupt Mr. Mosby during his hours of reflection.,Pj
"Sorry for the inconvenience, sir. You need something else?",Pj
I would not refuse a cup of coffee.,Ted
You're right next door!,Robin
So now Ted is assisted to do nothing.,Robin
"PJ is a great help. Install the desktop, create the Web site. And in return, I guide a young brilliant mind.",Ted
"Yes, the guide.",Robin
I want you to go out today and... put your hands on the buildings. Okay? Sense the vibrations of the concrete. Listen to the stories that you tell the stones. And going to the cleaners.,Ted
"I will. Thank you very much, Mr. Mosby.",Man
All right.,Ted
This table just told me that you're an idiot.,Robin
This idea of being a guide is to procrastinate the fact of calling customers.,Robin
"I do not procrastinate. I just want everything to be perfect, right? I have only one test.",Ted
"Okay, but PJ does not help.",Robin
"If Ted says that PJ is necessary to society, then PJ will go nowhere.",Barney
You see? It is useful.,Ted
"PJ is a guy? PJ, this is not a hottie you f*ck?",Barney
"No, I guide him.",Ted
"A Guide. I guided a young, once. I made him my co-pilot. Then one day, he hired an assistant to work 3 meters from her room, which... Check it out... is not a hottie, proving he has never listened. You know how to call this type?",Barney
Ted Mosby?,Ted
"Maybe. I remember more. Because for me he is dead! PJ will receive a mail with a disruptive place, it should in any circumstances be three days and then send it to me.",Barney
"I thought of something to become indispensable.The Ecolo-man! Everyone loves recycling, eh?",Marshall
Fired. What else you got?,Barney
I have others. Ties-Fun-man.,Marshall
Fired.,Barney
Info-Unusual-man?,Marshall
Did you know? Whether you're fired?,Barney
Stretch-man?,Marshall
upside down Vir√©.,Barney
The Monty-Python-man?,Marshall
We are the knights who say... You're fired.,Barney
Wait! I ran a simulation league baseball in school.,Marshall
Not bad. You got maybe something.,Barney
Great! Great! I Simulates-man!,Marshall
"Actually, you'll Sports-man. We have already Simulates-man.",Barney
"OK, guys?",Man
"Hi, Frank.",Barney
"Hello? Hello, PJ. Where are you? You're never late.You're mounted on the Empire State Building? Listen to the old lady. She knows stories. Take your time.  Wait.Ted Mosby House. The call comes from within!  This is not the Empire State Building. You can not sleep with my assistant. I try to work here, me. How did that happen?",Ted
"At noon, when you go to any walk of reflection, that leaves us time to spend together.",Robin
Inspiration... do your work.,Ted
"Each time, chief. Every time.",Pj
"Tell me, PJ, I have a question for you architecture.Ted's ass what taste?",Robin
"No idea, but probably the taste of engineering.",Pj
It's locked?,Robin
Visitors must register for the key.,Pj
"Listen, PJ. And I want you to think seriously before answering. You tell me I can not go to the bathroom with me?",Robin
I tell you that you must ask permission to use the toilet in my premises.,Pj
Why does it excite me?,Robin
There's billions of guys on Earth. Why do you sleep with him?,Ted
"When I leave the job, it is 5:30 am. Got an idea of guys I meet?",Robin
"I distribute the newspaper, it's dirty but someone has to do. Do not worry, I wash them before you fiddle with the parties.",Man
I live with my mom. In the evening they watch TV in bed.It's called The club hugs.,Man
"So, you get up very early to discuss the European market? How is it?",Robin
"Look, we'll do it or not?",Man
"First, I know Simulates-man, this is a good match.Second, it must stop! If you distract PJ, you lose productivity.",Ted
What productivity? You did not call a single customer.,Robin
"Once launched the website, printed brochures, and the choice of games at the business seminar, I will call.",Ted
Seminar?,Robin
Mr. Mosby and I are going camping on the roof.,Pj
Sports-man. I heard people talking about your club.,Barney
"It's a bit harder than I thought. Registration fees, transaction charges penalty, I... keeps a lot of money.",Marshall
"Good job, Sport-man. That's last week.",Grub-man
"60, 80, 100. $ 18 000 in cash. It's nothing. I'll bring it home and put them in a safe place.  OK, walk down the street with money in his pocket. Not touch the money. It's so obvious. Be natural. The baby looks at me.Babies can smell money. It is known! I carry a lot of money!",Marshall
"Really, dude, I know not how long I'll keep.",Marshall
Last week you were a waste that nobody was looking.Now you're Sports-man.,Barney
A waste?,Marshall
Last week!,Barney
This is Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. How is the home office?,Marshall
"Okay, until Robin sleeps with my assistant.",Ted
"This is our apartment. You let a cake on the counter, Mama's going to offer a slice.",Robin
"I've told you, commits a pretty assistant with whom you can sleep instead of hiring an assistant with whom Robin sleeps. Of course he'll sleep with her. It is the coolest on the planet. I am off topic! You're an idiot! This is my message!You're an idiot! An angry person, that's not enough! Marshall with me!",Barney
"Dude, why are you so upset that Ted does not sleep with the people he hires?",Marshall
Because it hurts!,Barney
How so?,Marshall
It hurts because I love... when Ted... layer with women. I am a very devoted friend! Lily is the only one I can talk. Tell him to talk to me.,Barney
"I'll try, but no warranty. She is still shocked by this joke. This joke. It tore our group, which turns the people I love against the other. Frankly, I would... I would like this joke is never entered our lives.",Marshall
"It's funny anyway, right?",Barney
It's very funny.,Marshall
"Good news, PJ. The brochures just arrived. Great choice for coverage. I like that instead of one of my creations, you to choose that.",Ted
You know what? I had to send the wrong photo.,Pj
"You think so? Listen to PJ, the website is still not done.You're not even come to the seminar... In fact, I saw a sh**ting star... and you're late every day. Sorry, PJ. I must be concentrated. You're fired.",Ted
You can not fire me...,Pj
You're fired.,Ted
"Well!  Hi, baby, I've just been fired.Yes, I'll wait with you.  The Wheel of Fortune.",Pj
I like having all this time to spend with you book. I'll kiss you there... And there... And here and there. And...,Pj
One more.,Robin
Stop.,Ted
I'm going to the toilet. I'll miss you.,Pj
I'll miss you too.,Robin
You've already tired of him.,Ted
"It is driving me crazy. When PJ was working, he was sexy. The keeper of the key toilet. A sexy guy that says when you can go to the bathroom or not? It's the dream.",Robin
It's the dream? The dream? As mentioned by Martin Luther King?,Ted
"I have to stop, right? I know not break.",Robin
"I still have to go, but I could no longer stay away from you.",Pj
"Listen... Dude, I know.",Robin
What?,Pj
"Yes, it's just... It's not really... that, you know?",Robin
It's on what?,Pj
I feel it.,Robin
Do you not feel anything?,Pj
But friends and others.,Robin
"My God, this is the worst break.",Ted
You're breaking up with me?,Pj
"If this is what you want, I totally understand.",Robin
You do not use this short-stop that the Mariners have discussed. I must have.,Toy-man
"You see, Sports-man. People adore you.",Barney
"I can be more Sports-man. I'm going crazy! I keep receiving text messages, emails and calls in the middle of the night. Sometimes I even think that I follow.",Marshall
"Hi, dude. We need you to do this exchange, I can prepare my team. You are really tight, is it not?",Douglas
"Seriously, it's over.",Marshall
I stop?,Douglas
No.,Marshall
Welcome Mosbius Designs.,Pj
Are you kidding?,Robin
Are you kidding?,Ted
"Apparently, Robin and PJ are together again.",Marshall
You're kidding!,Barney
How are you?,Marshall
"As Lily not speaking to me, I must tell you something.And it's not easy to say, OK? I... wait... 'm... wait... love...wait... of... wait... a... wait... some... wait...",Barney
I know you're in love with Robin.,Marshall
What?,Barney
Lily told me.,Marshall
She told you? Great. I guess you marrez my back all this time.,Barney
"Actually, oddly, we both think you're meant for each other.",Marshall
Really?,Barney
It even tries to sit on the same side for you to sit side by side.,Marshall
"Really? This is so cute. But let's be clear. I do not like it, OK? It's just that... I miss when she is not there. I think about her all the time, I guess one day we will run towards each other in slow motion and I wear a suede jacket.",Barney
Tell her how you feel?,Marshall
"No. Perhaps. Ever. I know not. Listen... I just need to get rid of that idiot PJ. If Lily was there, she would know how to get rid of him.",Barney
I can perhaps help you.,Marshall
"You're not Lily. Lily is a diabolical puppet master, the subtle situations to achieve its ends. This is evil incarnate. You have the right. Cling to it.",Barney
I was going to do my walk with wisdom. Want to go?,Ted
I took the key to the toilet without asking. Are you gonna do?,Robin
"Listen... you're great. But I chose another job. This is for you. Robin, I hope this letter will offer a conclusion. You will really miss.",Pj
Manny Ramirez is not exchange against two replacements!,Chow-man
"If you put your veto, I am going!",Toy-man
I'll find something.,Pj
"Hire the kid as his assistant. He does all the work and you're still Sports-man. Evil incarnate, Eriksen. Evil incarnate.",Barney
Are you okay?,Robin
And if I did not think the books?,Ted
Sorry?,Robin
"There is a history of architecture on a famous architect who designed the library. She was perfect. But every year, sinking a few inches into the ground. Obviously, the building was condemned. He forgot to take into account the weight of books. This box... it's just me. If I ever thought not to books?",Ted
"No one goes to the library, so you do not care of this type. And you must pick up the phone and call customers.",Robin
"The more I delayed the launch of my box, the more it can remain a dream and not something that I screwed up. It's like if I quit before it began.",Ted
"You wanna talk drop? I described as the perfect guy funny, intelligent, passionate, ambitious. And apparently, I just... In my apartment. You thought that you would have understood, now?",Robin
"Are you kidding? At 30, I had to have an insolent success, being married to the perfect woman, maybe a kid on the way. Instead, I'm just a guy sitting in his apartment, which is a competition look with his phone. And who loses.",Ted
You can do it.,Robin
"Hello, Ted Mosby Mosbius Designs. I learn about your design needs, present or future.",Ted
It looks good.,Robin
I looked confident?,Ted
Now known as a real customer.,Robin
Great.,Ted
"Hey, Chow-man!",Marshall
"Hey, Toy-man!",Barney
Who's this guy?,Marshall
He is not here. I think we should leave.,Barney
Really?,Marshall
It's happened before.,Barney
Super. So I'll call you.,Ted
I hope so.,Woman
Look at this.,Marshall
I had the number of that girl. Look. Holly.,Ted
"Owl. The girls with a name ending in LY are dirty.Holly, Kelly, Carly, Lily.",Barney
"Yeah, it's true.",Marshall
"And not to mention the girls with names ending in I instead of a Y. These girls are like rides. You make the long tail, but once inside, you hold on, hoping not to lose your keys.",Barney
You know what I'm going to do? I'll call on. I will do you remember me? It's been a . It's funny because I just saw.,Ted
You can not. You must wait three days before calling.This is the rule.,Barney
"This rule is completely outdated. They know exactly what you do. I have another rule. It's a bit crazy, but I call it, you like him, you call him.",Ted
Sorry. Can you repeat that? I do not mean the f*ck.,Barney
"My rule of three days, it is anything. Who invented it?",Ted
Jesus.,Barney
"Barney, do not do that. Not with Jesus.",Marshall
"Seriously. Jesus began this thing for three days. He waited three days to return to life. It was perfect. If he had waited one day we would not have known he was dead! They would have said: Jesus, are you? And Jesus would probably have said, You okay? I died yesterday! And they would say: You have the air alive, man.  And they should explain his resurrection. And the miracle. And then the guy would say, Okay, whatever you want, dude.",Barney
The dialogues seem pompous old now.,Robin
"And he will not come back on a Saturday. Everyone is busy doing chores. Weave, cut the beard. No. It looked exactly the right number of days... Three.",Barney
"I promise, I'll wait three days. Stop talking.",Ted
"And it's Sunday, they are all already in the church.They are all there, No, Jesus died. Then, bam! He burst through the door, crossed the aisle, everyone is excited. And by the way, that's where he invented the tope there! 3 days.We wait three days to call a woman because it is the time that Jesus wants us to wait. True story.",Barney
Okay. I promise. I will call not before three days.,Ted
What was that?,Robin
What?,Ted
You made a noise.,Robin
"This is my laptop, a text message.",Ted
Not that. You made the sound of the naked girl.,Robin
What?,Ted
"When you see a naked girl, you make noise.",Robin
That's not true.,Ted
Really?,Robin
"Sorry, Lily.",Ted
"While the men hunt, women of the Korowai tribe native wash their clothes in the river.",Voice
It's a breast.,Ted
This is Holly who writes to you? You're not promised to wait three days?,Robin
"To call. Texting, it's different.",Ted
"Okay, just try to proclaim your sound of the naked girl.",Robin
I make no noise.,Ted
Really?,Robin
Holly just told me what she wears. It's pretty exciting.,Ted
"Whatever it is, I guarantee you she do not wear it. She lies to please you.",Robin
How do you know?,Ted
"Because no woman in history has never, asked to read architectural magazines in my old... uniform cheerleader. ",Robin
"Okay, maybe she's lying on the architectural magazines.No. This is bad.",Ted
What?,Robin
She just sent me a message clearly intended for someone else.,Ted
"Baby, I got to eat at Generro. I come home soon. Yes, it sounds bad, but thinking a little. It is perhaps for his brother or father who is ill.",Robin
Come down.,Ted
And then I want to... you to take me on the couch.Maybe not a sick father. Father or a really sick... Right? Sorry.,Robin
Hi guys! What is it?,Robin
A meal that I Generro back to Lily.,Marshall
Bizarre. Holly sent a message to Ted talking about a meal Generro. A second. Band of bastards!,Robin
What?,Barney
You are Holly! So Ted did not send messages to Holly? He sent to you?,Robin
"We knew he would try to call three days before, so I took his cell phone and changed his number from mine.",Barney
"We wanted to call the chopper too early, but then he... sent text messages.",Marshall
Piti texting?,Barney
"Poor, little Ted. It should... He should say it estnous.",Marshall
Yeah. Or... it pretends to Holly and we are in the bath.,Barney
It's better. It was funny. He should say that it is us.,Marshall
It should. Or... it is said that red is our favorite color and found the look cowboy sexy.,Barney
It's better.,Marshall
I wear them right now and they are very sexy.,Ted
He put the boots!,Barney
He bluntly put! It was great! But it's time to tell him that he wears.,Marshall
Or... we remove our shirts.,Barney
It's better.,Marshall
"Maybe that door below, a black bra with lace.",Barney
I believe that wearing anything underneath.,Marshall
It is hot.,Barney
"There, he wears only cowboy boots! Here we go!",Marshall
Too! Tell him we slowly drag our... What do we do?,Barney
I think we'll... have sex with Ted.,Marshall
You did this all day? This is wicked.,Robin
"No, actually it was for his good. It protects it from itself. He really likes this girl. He had that look.",Marshall
"The crazy eyes, I'm going too fast and I will f*ck up everything.",Barney
The same he had with you the first time.,Marshall
We all know what it gave.,Barney
I'm in love with you.,Ted
What?,Robin
"I was a single case. This is not Holly Robin Scherbatsky. What is wrong with her hair? News Flash: detangling, it exists for not having a helmet. I'm so mean.",Robin
It's been that Ted did not like someone. He stored much... We thought him to say I love you when he contacted her.,Marshall
And it's coming. It shows all the telltale signs.,Barney
First: he jokes with the marriage.,Marshall
You like architecture? We should get married. Ha-ha.MDR. Just kidding. So what? ,Barney
Deuzio: it's far too early suggestions crazy travel.,Marshall
I like beer. We should go to Germany. MDR. JP.MDR. ,Barney
Third: it says too early personal things.,Marshall
My parents divorced two years there. It was really hard. MDR. ,Barney
And he really knows not what means MDR.,Robin
"Yeah, but that's the problem. Ted did not say I love you as easily as we thought.",Marshall
And then we met Stan.,Barney
Why do you so much noise?,Stan
"So, he explained everything and once finished, there was something fascinating.",Marshall
"Why not say you know it's there, thinking of you, concerned about you, and you feel safe? Your fears, your past disappear. And that the only hope is the promise of a hug.",Stan
Super Stan. Who is it?,Robin
A guard who works nights.,Barney
He eats here every day.,Marshall
And he had not finished.,Barney
Far from it.,Marshall
"I thank God for every mistake I made, because each of them told me the path that led me to you.",Stan
It's... really nice.,Marshall
No matter. It's OK.,Barney
"And when, finally, we will be together, I want you to enlaces. ",Holly
Hug me all night. Stroking my hair. Tell me I'm a woman and show me that you are a man. Until there is now. You and me... and now.,Stan
You want me to send it to Ted. I knew it.,Marshall
"I do not ask someone to explain the night. I wait and it envelops me. And you're like bread, light and shadow. ",Holly
This is Pablo Neruda.,Stan
"I do not know... what comes to the bread here, but it touches me... here... and here.",Marshall
"Well, if Ted does not say, I will. I love you.",Barney
That's cool. Still nothing?,Stan
It is perhaps not in love with us.,Marshall
How is this possible? It's all there waiting!,Barney
I do not understand men.,Marshall
I go to work.,Stan
Do... you come back?,Marshall
"I'll be back when the wind, destiny and luck will take me back. That is to say tomorrow. This is the day of the cheesesteak.",Stan
That guy you fell in love. I hope his girlfriend is not jealous. He spoke of a friend or...?,Robin
All was well until he sends a text message for Lily and ruins everything.,Barney
"It's okay. It's over now. I have to leave, but that's what happens: you call it now, tell him what you did and apologize.Got it?",Robin
Yes.  Or...,Barney
"Holly explained everything to me, it was just a misunderstanding. All is well now.",Ted
Really? How she explained the scope of texting?,Robin
"Apparently, his idiot friend of Marsha accidentally used his phone for a message to her husband Billy.",Ted
Marsha and Billy. They are not trampled.,Robin
"And now I feel better than ever. It sounds crazy, but I think that I am attached to this girl.",Ted
You cling to Barney and Marshall.,Robin
What?,Ted
"They did not believe that you'd wait three days, so Barney has changed his number by that of his work laptop.Holly is Barney and Marshall.",Robin
"Wait. It was them all along? So Holly was not in his bath?Or sitting by the window, gazing at the stars thinking of me? Or on his couch cheerleader reading architecture magazines?",Ted
I think they have done that. They were just at the bar.,Robin
It's true.,Ted
"Yes, it was them.",Robin
Incredible!,Ted
I know. You should tell them that you are not fooled.,Robin
Or... I send them a text message that will really confuse them.,Ted
"I see. Why not: I have told anyone yet, but I only have three months to live?",Robin
"Not bad. And: I k*ll a man with a shovel, and those feelings resurface?",Ted
I love this thing someone said about three months to live.,Robin
I've never told anyone but I slept with the mother of my best friend. ,Ted
"It's good, but I think it comes down to trick the three months to live.",Robin
Wait. I think I have.,Ted
"He replied! I probably should not tell you, finally, we barely knew, but never mind, I say it anyway. ",Marshall
"That's it, man. This is the I love you.",Barney
I would like Stan to be there.,Marshall
Stan. What?,Barney
I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend.,Marshall
I sometimes have dreams about my gay best friend. ,Barney
"Ted Why send text messages to a girl he barely knows, where he says he dreams about me gay?",Marshall
Easy. You? He speaks clearly to me.,Barney
"Dude, I'm his best friend.",Marshall
"Okay, one: It has never been proven. Two: If anyone had any dreams about gays one of us would be on me! Finally, look at me. Now look at you. An octogenarian still in her closet would not be in this state.",Barney
"That's the trick. I hug you, no. Who would not want to cuddle in this case, on Sunday morning? Wrapped in the quilt while it is raining, and there are muffins in the oven. I'm cuddly, bitch. You must do.",Marshall
I train every day. One thing we know about Ted is that he likes a nice body. This body would vibrate.,Barney
"Ted and I, we lived. I know what he likes. There are things I can do it... he √©poustoufleraient Why do they sleep with Ted?",Marshall
I know. It's weird.,Barney
"Crazy, no? Ted had dreams about me gay.",Barney
"And by me, he means Marshall Eriksen, star of Ted's gay dreams.",Marshall
"So what? So Ted has gay dreams about one of you. It's not as if he had three months to live. It would... Shocking, no?",Robin
Look at this guy. How is my best friend for 12 years?,Marshall
"It's a bit weird, but... I had a strange dream yesterday. It's a bit embarrassing.",Ted
You can tell us. This is a secure area.,Barney

Of course.,Ted
"So, the machines... k*ll everyone. And there are only you, me, and Barney. Who among us would you... you?",Marshall
And.. why should I make me one of you?,Ted
Machines force you. They want to watch. That's how they erupt.,Barney
"It's hard. I imagine it would be... Holly. Robin told me everything. That's why I invented everything. Guys, here is Holly. And I have not waited for your precious three days to call. I knew where she was working so I found. Let me ask you? It was too early?",Ted

Holly and I are going to dinner.,Ted
I'll meet you outside.,Holly
Sorry. It was just trying to help you.,Marshall
"And also, it was really funny.",Barney
"I do not need help, OK? I can look after myself. And yes, maybe some girls do not like to be called away or they may say too, but guess what? These are not good for me. Maybe the good is the one that loves me to do that, because... this is who I am and I will not change because of a stupid rule of the Three Days. Holly spells his name with an I.",Ted
"It's funny! I also love indie music. We should get married. I laugh. Or not? I laugh again. That's it. We go to Brazil together! I saw my doctor this morning, he told me that everything was settled, so I can go. I think I love you.",Holly

I see it. I see it.  What is it good?,Ted
All-Nighter?,Robin
I told them I had a vision for this thing. They want a drawing in a week and I have nothing!,Ted
It's cute.,Robin
"Cute? I can draw concert halls and bridges. Bridges so beautiful they could be in museums. And I could draw these museums. But I draw, what instead? Where is my career? A two-story Stetson... with a terrace on the edge. It's a cosmic joke. The universe conspires against me.",Ted
Did you just need to get out. Take a walk. Pay yourself a bagel.,Robin
"Yeah, that'll solve everything. I have not slept for 34 hours, but a bagel is the answer. Cinnamon and raisin bagel with some cream. It looks good. I'll buy one.",Ted
"Take an umbrella. It's going to rain, according Galoshes, our clown-weather.",Robin

"I will raise this child with you. You're not alone. You can get married if you want, but I want to see other girls, it would be one of those marriages...",Ted
"Stop! I'm not pregnant. This is an intoxication. I ate something at the restaurant, three hours later, I vomited like a fountain.",Robin
Where?,Ted
This is a disgusting issue.,Robin
Where was your meal?,Ted
I want to tell you.,Robin
What?,Ted
Someone has already put on YouTube?,Robin
Yeah... someone. So... why did you vomit? You're pregnant?,Barney
"Yeah, I'm pregnant.",Robin
Why do you not tell me where you got your intoxication?,Ted
"You adore this place. If I tell you, it will ruin it.",Robin
It makes sense. Do not say anything.,Ted
This Indian restaurant where the cat jumps on the tables?,Ted
I say nothing.,Robin
The Spanish restaurant with the cradle?,Ted
I say nothing.,Robin

The 200th with that... get laid?,Ted
Who I'll lie. I want the highest Tope there.,Barney
Even if I was wearing protective clothing. 200 is too much!,Ted
"As if there could be too much of something wonderful.Babe Ruth, gently, my grandfather. Do not hit too many home runs. Steve Guttenberg, you should not do that three Police Academy. America has laughed enough. ",Barney
Who are these girls? It was rhetorical. Show me the list.,Ted
"199 satisfied customers. Finally, the big night is Thursday. I give a reception before, in McClaren's. Prepares a toast. Tuxedo optional but desired. Gifts are, I would say useless, but follow your heart.",Barney
200 is too much.,Ted
It's not too much.,Barney
That's too!,Ted
It's not too much.,Marshall
Thank you.,Barney
"Do not misunderstand. You're disgusting and the cops should put a shoe on your part, but this number should be higher. After Barney told me about that, I reviewed the figures and... I have some graphics. Barney dredge about 20 girls a week.",Marshall
It's more than 20. B. Does nothing more precise estimate.,Barney
"Let 20. So 20 girls a week, that's 1,040 girls a year.In its 16 years of sexual activity, it would mean that he has dredged 16,640 girls. If he has slept with 199, it's a success rate... slightly higher than one per cent. This is an average of 12 hits, eight times worse than average in career... launcher in one hand, the launcher... Jim Abbott.",Marshall
"Jealous. Jealous. Hero. Strangely silent during this conversation on his number of sexual partners. Hero. The grand total, it is the only number that matters.",Barney
Who said so?,Ted
"Matthew Panning, the stud of Port Richmond College.",Barney
"Stinson, you're an amateur. I bet you've never done.",Matthew
You neither.,Barney
How many times I have to tell you? I did it with 100 girls. Fifth in school from my cousin in Long Island.,Matthew
"You know what, Matthew? One day, I would have done with 200.",Barney
Call me when it happens.,Matthew
And I'll call.,Barney
I think he'll say it again very slowly.,Ted
I will... the call.,Barney
"You have noted Gaby Allan dual, 78 and 162.",Robin
"What? Let me see. Sixty... Once. Oh, my God. Wait...I counted the same girl twice? That means I'm only at 198?",Barney
It just means you're less than 0.5% was thought disgusting.,Marshall
I win a Czech supermodel in two hours. I can not waste it in the 199th. Petra must be the 200th.,Barney
are you gonna do? You will find not a partner in the next 2 hours.,Ted
Astronaut Millionaire. You come home to see shells?,Barney
I come from the grave of my wife. I buried her there was just one year. I miss her. I need comfort.,Barney

"Marshall? Knowing how important it is for me, you think that Lily... I would do the job...",Barney
I'll k*ll you.,Marshall
Okay.,Barney
Where did Barney? It's been over an hour.,Ted
"You know, looking at the names on this list, I do not see a lot of ethnic diversity. It should really be questioned.",Robin
"It's done. 199 made of, more than one. Have you finished your drink?  That's better.",Barney
It has happened to you what?,Ted
There... a girl in the gym. Pauline. She runs after me for a while.,Barney
Why wait till then?,Ted
It's not really my type.,Barney
"Good, Pauline. You're going to have all of Fonte Leveuse Sarasota Classic this fall. I thought... to you and me.And if you're still interested...",Barney
"Ok, this is the hour of cardio.",Pauline
Good grief! Mom!,Barney
"Every inch tasted like roast beef and creatine. But I did. I did and I still have 30 minutes before meeting with Petra.Robin, you have the foundation? I want to cover bruises and razor burn.",Barney
"I hate to tell you this, but...",Robin
What?,Barney
"You did the right Gaby Allan counted 2 times, but...you're also spent 138 to 138. Have you used the same number twice.",Robin
"So that means... Pauline is not the 199th, it is the 200th?",Barney
Congratulations!,Ted
"It must have Petra! Petra was to be the 200th!Beautiful, feminine, unrestrained power in bed, Petra!",Barney
"Go! Happened to you at 200. You should be proud. You should be tested, but you should be proud. We do not care if Pauline does not pose in bikinis in magazines.",Ted
"It does. She will be in the next Muscle Sexxy. And like many women in this magazine, Sexxy has two X and one Y.",Barney
"Fran, I will not bother you, but I have a presentation tomorrow and it would help me if I could have tables and graphs. Can you help me?",Marshall
"This is the graphics department. We can make all the graphs, tables, in all colors on the paper you want.",Fran
We'll have fun.  I ranked the presidents in order of disloyalty. A: Johnson. Two: Bush. Three Harding.Four: Polk.  This circle represents Those who break my heart. And this circle represents Those who constantly undermine my confidence. And where they meet: Cecilia.  This is a pie chart describing my favorite bars. And that is a graph describing my favorite pies. What is it?,Marshall
That's enough tables.,Robin
What about the graphics.,Barney
Any visual representation of data.,Ted
"I'm not stupid. I know what you think of my paintings and graphics. In fact, I made a picture of your reactions to my paintings. See it. Yes, that's true, since Cecilia, your interest in my paintings do not stop falling. But based on recent trends, I also... projection boards! And look... a large peak of interest is coming! And it's not just a blip dead cat. It is a long-term growth.",Marshall
"It's you, sustained growth.",Barney
"So, I prepared some charts to show how the setting up of a shell company in Bermuda could minimize our losses in the second quarter. And you avoid jail. To begin with...Excuse me a moment?",Marshall
Mosbius Designs.,Ted
What happened to my pictures?,Marshall
They were thrown.,Ted

"That's an intervention. You could not stop eating, so we threw your cam.",Ted
"Come on, Ted! I need my pictures! Only for today and I promise to never ever do. I suffered a lot of pressure. I need my paintings, Jack!",Marshall
You make tables work?,Ted
"It's for work, idiot! I make a great show and if I have not these pictures, I'm gonna get fired!",Marshall
Damn. Not move. I bring them.,Ted
"Magne! I will research how to wait.  Sorry, there is a little late with the tables. But we'll begin in a moment. Fish are weird, right? I mean, what's their problem?",Marshall
Tables! Buy your tables!,Voice
"I'm sorry, Milt? I think these are my paintings.",Ted
These tables? On my coverage?,Milt
This is my blanket. We'll see later. But I need these tables.,Ted
Good thing they are selling.,Milt
"Okay, how?",Ted

The problem is that the distributor...,Ted
The alien time machine...,Milt
The alien time machine has a withdrawal limit. That's what I'll do. I give you a dollar... per day... for a million days.,Ted

"You've thought of consulting as I win, you lose?Suddenly, your 100 girls in fifth, it is so impressive.",Barney
100 girls? This is what it is? I lied!,Matthew
Of course.,Barney
"I was 12, I was lying of course. I had no Ewok companion.",Matthew
Of course.,Barney
Your adult life is built on... something... on which I lied to 12?,Matthew
Jealous?,Barney
"I get my kids to school. Looks like you got a lot of problems. Good luck, I guess.",Matthew
I'm awesome. 200. Now what?,Barney
Stella! Glad to see you again!,Ted
I do too.,Stella
And Tony! What a nice surprise.,Ted
"What a nice surprise? No, a nice surprise would have been a safe falls from 40 stories e crushes them both. You let yourself do?",Robin
We had a friendly discussion and we resumed our respective paths.,Ted
"You're f*cked up. He f*cked up, right?",Robin
"Well played, sir.",Barney
Well done.,Marshall
What?,Robin
"You know, Ted has played cool, that's exactly what he should do. In fact, I would say on a scale of...",Marshall
... up...,Marshall
Enchanted.,Tony
I think you've been great.,Marshall
"I would say even more. You, sir, did think Stella. Ted looked so cool now. Do I chose the wrong? Wait a week. The bush on the back. And belly. Have you felt that? There was an earthquake Tope-there.",Barney
I am not on the back. Or stomach. I want to move forward.And it was an important step towards that. The future.,Ted
I made a terrible mistake.,Stella
I know. I'm better than you.,Ted
Bluntly. Ressortons lie down together and much more.,Stella
Sold!,Ted
"Hi, Ted.",Tony
"No, between. It's not weird at all.",Ted
"I knew it was wrong to steal someone's girlfriend. I got used to it. I could not sleep. And for the wrong reasons.Sometimes for good reasons. Stella and I, we had not seen for five years, so you can imagine, at first it was fast and intense.Broken lamps, furniture moved. You see this bald area?Regardless, we turned the page. Me, Lucy, Stella, we would be moving to LA I was going to become a screenwriter. Then, you have been crossed, and you looked so... sad.",Tony
Sad? No. I think what you call sorrow was only... jovial nonchalance.,Ted
"You're wrong, OK? As a small dachshund with back pain who should be walking in a bag.",Tony
Why are you here?,Ted
"I know I can be a bit harsh, but I can not bear to have you as many wounded. Fate put me in the street to fix it.Obviously, I can not fill the crater left by Stella in your heart.",Tony
I met lots of girls.,Ted
And I know you've been fired.,Tony
I switched to running a small business. This is the lung of the economy.,Ted
"No. Ted, my family has a lot of money. And I want to use that money to fix it with you.",Tony
Tony is rich? Tell me that you wrote a check. Tell me that you did a very big check. So big that he not remove his shirt to go swimming.,Marshall
"It's a very big check. IF big, that if you sleep with, you would not tell your friends.",Barney
It's a very big check.,Marshall
"So big, that when you sit next to on the plane, you wonder if the check would not have had to buy two seats.",Robin
It's...,Marshall
A very big check!,Barney
Yeah! He has not signed a check.,Ted
"Ted, I want to offer you a job.",Tony
A job?,Ted
"Every year, my family gives a lot to Columbia University, I have contacts. How would you like to design...",Tony
... your own resume as professor of architecture.,Tony
No thank you.,Ted
"What do you mean no thank you? You'd be a great teacher. You are an expert, you can talk, and when necessary, you can get to grow a beautiful beard.",Marshall
"I will not be a professor. That's what you do when your career is in trouble and you have to pay the bills. Manager of small business. The lung of the economy. I will not take this job, okay? I'll get through. New topic.",Ted
"Okay. Today, I had a $ 200 fine for speeding.",Barney
"That sucks, dude. You did not manage to blow it up?",Marshall
You can not blow a fine.,Barney
I have done. It was... when? In 1998.,Marshall
Where's the fire?,Policeman
"There is no fire. In fact, you know, there's a fire in the barbecue where I go. Nothing special. Burgers, chops...merguez.",Marshall
You know it's dangerous to go... You said sausages?,Policeman
"Yeah, merguez. My mother's marinated in beer for 2 days. That's it. It's weird, I could have sworn that what those big, succulent smoked sausages had writing on it. Bizarre.You were saying?",Marshall
That was writing what? The merguez?,Policeman
"It said: Ownership of Minnesota police, Jorgensen.You like merguez, Jorgensen agent?",Marshall
You go to this address? Follow me with the siren.It will burn red lights.,Policeman
"I would have done that too, if I went to a barbecue.Slim, I went there.",Barney
It's all in the assessment of your enemy. I knew he loved the sausages because he was out of breath just by coming to my car and he had mustard on his holster.,Marshall
Handling a police officer with your sausage. It's sexy.,Robin
"You think I can not blow a fine? You think I can not blow my fine? I am Barney Stinson, master of manipulation. If I managed to make me pay for a stripper to dance, I can blow a fine. Challenge accepted... wait.",Barney
I understand. Ack-Ted. I understood.,Ted
What now?,Ted
You wanna be an architect? Super. A guy I was in school wants a new home. The job is yours if you want.,Tony
"Tony, I do not need your help.",Ted
That's his job.,Tony

Let's go.,Barney
Driver and vehicle registration.,Police
"Of course, officer. On.",Barney
"Sir, this is a gift certificate for a custom Italian suit.",Policeman
"So, what's good?",Barney
$ 375! And he kept the gift certificate. Emilio and I'll call him tell him to shorten the crotch.,Barney
"You're wrong about that, man.",Robin
"Anything, Robin. Like you've already blown a fine.",Barney
Are you kidding? Robin is a pretty girl. They have no fines. I bet she was often stopped and has never had.,Marshall
This is outrageous! And relevant.,Robin
"Permits and... Sweetie. No, do not cry. OK, not fine for you. Drive slower next time, OK?",Policeman
Thank you.,Robin
Excuse me. I left something in New Jersey.,Barney
How was your lunch with the rich? It started well.,Robin
"I want to design a home that showcases the landscape without dominating. IN 1935, when Frank Lloyd Wright designed the house to the waterfall...",Ted
"Yes, that's fine. You will do a good job. My concern is the basement. Especially the laundry.",Man
The laundry room?,Ted
"I want a laundry room of 5 x 5 meters, ceramic tiles stain-resistant floor to ceiling. I am a man who likes to do his own laundry, and sometimes it's messy.",Man
Gruesome?,Marshall
Gruesome.,Ted
steel chains hanging from the ceiling 3 meters. This is where my bags of laundry will be hung for three days and three nights before I... cleans.,Man
"Ted, it looks like this guy asks you to design...",Robin
A deadly house.,Ted
That's it. A house of horror.,Robin
"By practicing martial arts, I learned to believe in my instinct and my instinct tells me that... it sounds great.",Tony
The steak is very rare.,Ted
Do not you?,Ted
"One last point, soundproofing. I tend to make much noise when I wash. I'll show you. I'll go in the laundry room and tell me if you hear me.",Man
"It's a bit serious, huh?",Ted
Grave well. You hit the nail.,Tony
You can not do this house!,Robin
I will not do.,Ted
You can not do it!,Marshall
I will not do it!,Ted
"Come on. Mr. Officer, please, my wife is having a baby! She just lost the waters!",Barney
Where is your wife?,Policeman
"She took the other car. It's Italian leather, so... I... go...",Barney
"Sorry for this house of horror. It was my fault. It is for me.New plan. My friend, you will build a husband to the Statue of Liberty. I have some knowledge in the town hall.",Tony
"Stop! I do not want your help, OK? You did not do that.",Ted
Yes,Tony
Why?,Ted
"Because... when you were with Stella, I missed her terribly. I can imagine how you feel.",Tony
"Let me reassure you. I do not want to Stella. She lied to me, dumped me at the altar. Who can do that? I'm better off without her. It is all yours, buddy.",Ted
Okay. A weight less.,Tony
Stella?,Ted
Tony left me.,Stella
Tony left you?,Ted
He said it was because of what you said.,Stella
"You did break Tony and Stella? Really sorry, but I must insist that you topes there.",Robin
Let's talk in the hallway.,Ted
I'll wait.,Robin
Why are you here?,Ted
"Look, Ted, I was 7 months late, but that's how. I'm in love with Tony, since high school. We went out for a long time, and then... I became pregnant and for a 19 year old daughter, it was too much to handle, and it broke. And for a long time, I too thought about my role as mother. I forgot Tony. I forgot...what it was like being in love. Then you came and everything was resurrected. And I loved you for that. I loved you so much, in fact, it was just... enough. But I always liked Tony.",Stella
"No, it's not what happens. Tuck, Mrs. Matsen. Delighted to have you review, Stella.",Ted
Can you talk to Tony?,Stella
What?,Ted
He'll listen. You made him change his mind. You can do it again. It is cruel to ask that...,Stella
"Yes, it's cruel to ask it.",Ted
I do not know what else to do. I love it.,Stella
"You love her? What, you do call my romance? It's your strategy? Because this guy is gone. You can have me over like that. I am attached to nothing, thanks to you.",Ted
Enter!,Ted
"OK, you can do it. You can do it! You can do it.",Barney
Driver and...,Police
Licensing and registration papers.,Barney
Pardon?,Police
You must have a permit to be as pretty. And this body? I imagine that something as expl*sive must be registered with the authorities.,Barney
Exit the vehicle.,Police
"Why, am I under arrest?",Barney
No. It depends on what you will do me.,Police
False. This has never happened.,Robin
"It's from a porno. I saw him. Shit, I did.",Marshall
When will you understand the difference between my life and a porno is that my life has better lighting.,Barney
You're lying.,Robin
I'm not lying! I swear on my mother. I swear Goliath National Bank. I swear on my costumes. I... do... mens... not.,Barney
"Tuck, Mrs. Matsen!",Stella
Enter!,Ted
I can not do anything to fix everything?,Stella

It's me! This is Barney. With the help! I have big problems!,Barney
Slow down. What's going on?,Ted
I imagine that something as expl*sive must be registered with the authorities.,Barney
Get out.,Police

You wanna do something for me? I have to go in New Jersey.,Ted
"You pay the toll, eh? I laugh.",Stella
"By the way, how's the girl you see? This superb French with huge tits?",Barney
You talk about Claudette? She is fine.,Ted
The highest good of all those with whom you're never out! Ever!,Barney
"Again, sorry for everything. Actually...",Stella
I talk to Tony.,Ted
Really?,Stella
I want you to be happy. I will speak to him.,Ted
"Just tell me one thing. Why Tony? I mean, it's money, pajamas kung fu? Finally... What is it?",Ted
That is correct.,Stella
Good.,Ted
"It's a little silly, but yes.",Stella
"I will say out loud something that I had managed not to say out loud. Have you, Tony and you... That at one point I thought I had with you... I know that Marshall and Lily... I want that. I want to. I keep waiting and waiting for that to happen and... I guess I'm just... tired of waiting. And that's all I have to say about it.",Ted
I've already told you that I avoided a PV?,Stella
Really?,Ted
"I was at my parents by doing 130 and I was arrested.The cop comes out of his car. He struts around a bit to me like, Girl, I've waited all day. Then I looked and I said, Sorry, Mr. Officer. I came as fast as I could. ",Stella
Really?,Ted
"An old joke. I know you're tired of waiting and may require you to wait a little longer, but it happens, Ted. And it happens as fast as she can.",Stella
"She was found two days later, in the directory. I've never put my name in my underwear.",Barney
You're back!,Barney
"When listening to this joke of peanut butter and jam, I was completely disgusted. But this morning in the shower, I thought about it and it made me laugh. Peanut butter. So I think I could win. According to Marshall.",Lily
"It's good to see you, Lily.",Barney
Thank you. So what's new?,Lily

"I pass this building, so I see you in three days.",Ted
What are you doing?,Barney
A hat-shaped building.,Ted
It's time to talk?,Barney
No.,Ted
What do you think of Robin?,Barney
"I have to really work, so...",Ted
"Awesome. Say that is a tailor and you have found a nice suit. A nice suit Canada. Superb chest. You try it, but it does not suit you perfectly. So you return it. Then I try it. I'm not too keen... a suit that you have caught the eye, but at the same time, I love this costume.",Barney
Buy the costume. It is important to you. Tell him how you feel.,Ted
"But Ted, remember your answer, because... The costume is Robin. I know! Okay?",Barney
I'm with you.,Ted
Now. For I have explained.,Barney

"Come on, man, you're on it for three days without stopping. This is your birthday. Come have a beer on the roof.",Marshall
"Impossible, the presentation is tomorrow. These hats are not alone.",Ted
That's a big restaurant for tourists. Just put wide doors and chairs strengthened. Birthday beer on the roof. Let's go!,Marshall
Why do you want as I go on the roof? You made me a surprise party?,Ted
"What? We brought you a surprise party, last year.Thou shalt have no surprises on two holidays. The fact that the world has come to the first was surprising. Not? Two surprises on Christmas! It is very strong! It is very strong! Great! Super... It still will not mount.",Marshall
Come on. This is boring! I knew it was a bad idea.,Robin
"Yes, Robin, I know. This festival is... is... a disaster.It was my idea. I take responsibility. There is one thing to do.",Marshall
"Marshall, no.",Lily
"Lily, I have to!  It's useless to procrastinate.",Marshall
"Forget it. It really is not class. At best, it sucks.",Barney
You know who knows how to live? These people.,Marshall
It looks to be a... sacred... spa.,Marshall
Owl. How do we go? We will do what? Jump?,Barney

"Do not worry. If I can jump tonight, it will save the evening.",Marshall
"Honey, come down here, please.",Lily
"When Evel Knievel rode his rocket star on the shore of Snake River Canyon, you think his wife said Honey, come down here '?",Marshall
"For the last time, I'm not Linda Knievel! I will never be Linda Knievel!",Lily
No need to remind me.,Marshall
"Marshall, do not do that. Do not jump, please.",Lily
"Sorry, but I have to.",Marshall
You can not.,Lily
Why?,Marshall
You want a reason? You're going to have one. I am pregnant.,Lily
"My God! My God, really? I saw you look fat...",Marshall
"I was lying, bastard! Go ahead, jump! I hope u gonna die!",Lily
This is the permission I needed.,Marshall
"Look, Robin... I must tell you something.",Barney
"Wait. Before that, I must tell you something.",Robin
What is it?,Barney
I think I love you.,Robin
"This is Ted. Everyone! Ted, are you?",Lily
"She's here, Lily. She looks at me.",Ted
What?,Lily
The goat.,Ted
"It's been an incredible thing. I was talking to Robin, I would tell him my feelings, but just before, you will believe what ever she said.",Barney
I think I love you.,Robin
You said what?,Lily
In your opinion? What we can say to that?,Barney
"Robin, you're great listening. You're really great, but we're friends. This is not a good idea.",Barney
You must be right. Have fun.,Robin
"You too, sweetie.",Barney
What?,Lily
"Once she told me that, more than feelings. I'm more in love.",Barney
"You were in love with her, throughout the year and when she feels the same, you love him more.",Lily
It's not great?,Barney
It's a wuss. Not food.  How...?,Ted
It is. It... is... go! It is.,Marshall
"Tracey, tell Lily what you just said.",Barney
What I just arrived in New York?,Tracey
"No, how you've arrived there.",Barney
I just get off the bus from Iowa.,Tracey
Come off the bus from Iowa! How lucky that apprentice... dancer off the bus from Iowa... meeting... the producer of the Rockettes?,Barney
I believe in a classic story of showbiz.,Tracey
"Honey, you're there. You're really there.",Lily
"You can make us one of those rum and beer, that your father loves so much?",Barney
Of course!,Tracey
Damn.,Lily
What?,Barney
"Everyone always says, Do not tell Lily. Lily can not keep a secret. And, usually, they are right. But this time I kept the secret. And here you come with that crap and you force me to become the Lily will spill the beans!",Lily
What song? There was a piece?,Barney
There was a song.,Lily
The costume is Robin. I know! Okay?,Barney
I'm with you.,Ted
Now. As I explained...,Barney
What...,Ted
Shit.,Robin
He said that? My God! What an incredible surprise!,Lily
You know since when?,Robin
And you've said anything since? Bravo.,Robin
"Bravo, Lily. I mean, what a b*mb. Who saw this coming?",Marshall
You know since when?,Robin
7 months and 29 days.,Marshall
I will do what?,Robin
I know. Are you gonna do?,Lily
I'll marry Barney in a large church. We'll move to New Hampshire and open cottages.,Robin
Really?,Marshall
No! This is Barney. I mean... This is Barney. But it's Barney. I have to say no.,Robin
"Boy, you're going to break her... The thing that this black mud pump through his veins.",Lily
"You're right. For the first time he likes a girl, she pushes him away? And not just any girl. It's going to destroy it.",Robin
"OK, first... Second, there is a trick you can try. It's risky, but it can pay off. Lack of anything better, I'll call it... The Mosby.",Marshall
The Mosby?,Robin
"No, she can not mosbyser.",Lily
It could squarely mosbyser.,Marshall
What is the Mosby?,Robin
"Do you remember your first time with Ted? You wanted to get on the train Ted, visit his yard.",Marshall
I was ready to jump the turnstile.,Robin
What changed everything?,Marshall
I think I love you.,Ted
What?,Robin
The Mosby! It's great! And... excuse me.,Robin
"You're really pretty, but abnormally high and you will not believe in ghosts.",Marshall
"So... when she said love me, she meant... otherwise.",Barney
That's it. It worked well. You are back to normal.,Lily
Yes. It's true. And it's great. It's great.  So Robin does not like me.,Barney
No.,Lily
Why?,Barney
Mr. Goat?  M. The goat? Enough.  Crazy Goat. I do not understand your fascination with this mop. It should be normal with a brain the size of a...,Ted
"Marshall, you can pick up Ted?",Lily
I was about to jump. You've not heard saying OK loop?,Marshall
I'm sorry. Go ahead and jump.,Lily
"It's good. Sorry, everyone. Lily does not want me jumping.  Thank God.",Marshall
The hospital!,Ted
What has happened?,Lily
It happened... you left a wild animal in our apartment. I've been attacked.,Ted
This is the sweetest and adorable goat in the world.,Lily
The sweetest and adorable goat in the world?,Ted
You're the one who wanted to be a goat?,Doctor
It's the goat jumped on me! Can I go?,Ted
"Yes. But remember, Bee means bee.",Doctor
"Great, I'm late for my presentation. Thank you, Mr. Goat.",Ted
Mr. Goat? It's a girl. Her name is Missy.,Lily
You got b*at by a girl.,Marshall
So... You're in love with me?,Barney
What? Yes. Much.,Robin
You can stop. Lily told me everything.,Barney
"Damn, Lily!",Robin
I can not believe it.,Barney
"It's just... You mean to me, Barney. And... This kind of stuff, the emotional side. This is not your type. I thought you avoid that.",Robin
"Maybe I will not avoid it. I am perhaps. I have not wanted for a long time. But with you, it does not look so...difficult. I know not. I thought... you felt the same.",Barney
"Maybe. I know not. I am not good to face the feelings.There is clearly something... between us. Maybe my head said, stifles it in the bud because my heart said... something else. Listen... I feel for you. Maybe even that I love you.",Robin
"It's going pretty fast, do not you think?",Barney
What?,Robin
We're good friends. Why risk everything? Friends?,Barney
Friends.,Robin
My God. You just do it again. You've mosbys√©!,Barney
But no.,Robin
"But if, little flirtatious.",Barney
You're right. I've just mosbyser.,Robin
Why are you scared to try?,Barney
Because I'm afraid of how I could love you.,Robin
Bad idea.,Barney
You're right. There must be a mistake.,Robin
No.,Barney
I love you.,Robin
Friends.,Barney
"Friends, then.",Robin
I love you.,Barney
Let's get married.,Robin
"No, you're smothering me.",Barney
"OK, forget it.",Robin
You know what? We'll see later.,Barney
"Yeah, let's go.",Robin
"There he is, gentlemen. Rib Town. Is it not? Is it not?",Ted
"Ted, listen. You are great and you did a... great job, and you'll make other restaurants very happy one day, but... we...decided to go... in another direction.",Man
What?,Ted
Sven...,Ted
"I'll tell you, I will eat more chops.",Marshall
"Yeah, right.",Barney
I will not eat.. never... chops! Before Ted!,Marshall
It's a disaster. How I will recover?,Ted
"OK, I'm just asking. You really want to recover?",Lily
What does that mean?,Ted
"Architecture is k*ll you and it k*ll us to see her k*ll you.You're like the goat with the mop. You want it so much, and whenever the world try to get the resume, it hooks you. But you know what? This is only a wimp. Why do you want?",Lily
Because I have to be an architect. This is... That's the plan.,Ted
"In the crapper, the plan. I wanted to be a famous artist.Marshall wanted to be environmental lawyer. Robin wanted to be a TV reporter.",Lily
I am a TV reporter. I am on the air at 4am.,Robin
It continues? Bravo.,Lily
"What someone looks, please.",Robin
Barney wanted to be a violinist. Need not tell me. You can not draw your life as a building. It does not work like that. You must live it and draw it to itself.,Lily
"So what, I should do anything?",Ted
Look what the world tells you to do and took the leap.,Lily
"You're right. You're completely right. I love you, Lily.",Marshall
A metaphorical leap. A metaphorical leap!,Lily
Do not do that. Not cool.,All
I did it!,Marshall
"Honey, you did it!",Lily
I can do anything!,Marshall
It's true!,Lily
I bought a motorcycle!,Marshall
"No, not at all!",Lily
"OK, sorry. Come on, guys.",Marshall
Whoo!!!,Lily
Lily! All we need is your indoor whoo.,Robin
"Sorry.  Whoo! It's just they kissed! They're finally a couple. Oh, my God, you guys! This is our first double date! First of millions! What if our kids get married?! Oh I love this!",Lily
"Yeah, Lily, listen.",Barney
Barney's awesome.,Robin
Robin's more than just awe-some. She's awe-quite a bit. She's awe-a whole darn lot.,Barney
"Wait, what are you saying?",Lily
We're just not feeling it right now. But we'll totally still be friends.,Robin
Oh yeah.,Barney
Is it something I did?,Lily
"Oh no, no, no. God, no. Lily, it's not you. It's us.",Robin
"Yeah, It's us. You understand, right?",Barney
"Sure, of course. As long as you're happy, I'm happy.",Lily
We were gonna take cooking lessons together and we were gonna go on camping trips together and then we were gonna sit around telling funny stories about our cooking lessons and our camping trips.,Lily
I know. I Know. So... has the boat sailed on sex tonight or...,Marshall
Wow! What's this?,Ted
It's just a little something that we got for you that used to belong to my favourite professor of all time.,Marshall
A fedora!  I'm Indiana Jones! I'm Indiana Jones!!,Ted
"That, my friend, is the Dominator 8000, the best bullwhip on the market, according to my whip guy. Yeah, I have a whip guy.",Barney
You know what we should do? We should...,Ted
"Finish our drinks, go out in the alley, and whip stuff.",Marshall
God... you just get me.,Ted
"OK, I should get going. I got a date.",Robin
You're still seeing that guy?,Barney
"Even better, seeing him naked.",Robin
"I should go, too. I hooked up with this Chinese girl last night and I don't know, it's weird. I already feel like seconds.",Barney
"OK Ted, You got first whip!",Marshall
"All right.  Hey, dummy . What did tell you about smoking in here?",Ted
"Make him whip the habit! I'so excited about this whip! I got whip fever! Just whip him, Ted! Don't even aim! Just whip him!",Marshall
I'm so sorry.,Ted
"It's just the whip's not a toy. There's such a thing as common sense, you know.",Marshall
You can whip me if you want.,Ted
"I will, some other time.",Marshall
Whoo!!!!!!,Lily
"So, how long has this been going on?",Lily
All summer.,Barney
I knew it! I knew it! I knew it! You guys are boyfriend and girlfriend.,Lily
Girlfriend?,Barney
"Slow your roll there, Lilypad.",Robin
"Yeah, yeah.",Barney
You've been together all summer. I don't get it.,Lily
"Ok, It's like this. After we kissed, we sat down to have the talk.",Robin
We should figure out what this is.,Robin
"Yes, we should. Or. Or...",Barney
"Okay, now, we have to figure this out.",Robin
"Yes, we do. Or. Or...",Barney
We kept trying to have the talk and then we realized we hate the talk.,Robin
"Yeah, the talk sucks. You have to, like, talk. And be all, I don't know.",Barney
"You needs it. Guys, you can't just keep hooking up and not at least try and figure out what you mean to each other.",Lily
"Yeah, we knew you would say that. That's why we kept it a secret.",Robin
"Well, that and the fact that elaborate lies really turn us on.",Barney
"No, no, no . You need to define the relationship. You ne to have the talk.",Lily
Or. Or...,Barney
"I know what you're all thinking. Who's this cool peer of mine up in front the class? I know the board says Professor Mosby, but to you I'm Ted.",Ted
Question. Awesome. Hit it.,Ted
They're at home. I...,Ted
"Oh, God.",Ted
"Barney, it was awful. I was teaching...",Ted
"Ted, now's not a good time. Where do you keep your condoms?",Barney
I am freaking out. I don't think I can do this.,Ted
"Okay, look, mistake number 1 was taking that girl's question. You don't take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Mistake number 2 was you should've hit that. Dude, your pants were already off, you had a classroom full of people to cheer you on, and you can't knock her up 'cause it's a dream. Class dismissed.",Barney
"Mistake number 3, dude, where was the hat? Cause if you're not going to wear it, I'm taking it back.",Marshall
"I think what Barney's saying is that definitions are important. You're their teacher, not their friend.",Lily
Exactly.,Barney
"If people don't know their place, nobody's happy.",Lily
Amen.,Barney
You have to make things clear.,Lily
Run tell that.,Barney
Define the relationship.,Lily
"Yes! No! Lily, private convo time.",Barney
"Lily, can't you just let us be happy?",Barney
You're not happy. You just think you're happy because you feel happy.,Lily
And that's not happy?,Barney
Of course not. You and Robin need to have the talk.,Lily
Why? Give me one good reason.,Barney
I'll give you 20...,Lily
"Waow, You can't even think of one. Headlights. Dear. Lily, for the last time, things with me and Robin are as good as they can possibly be. Oh, hey, look, Brad's here.",Barney
"I've got two tickets to the Rangers/Canucks game tomorrow night. I know you're a hockey fan, so I was thinking...",Brad
"Euh, oh, hum, heu...",Robin
What do I have to do? Put a g*n to your head? Buy you a six pack?,Brad
"Come on, Brad, that's... Wow, There's really six of them. But, I can't.",Robin
Why not? You have a boyfriend?,Brad
"No. No, no boyfriend.",Robin
Great! It's a date.,Brad
Hey Barn!,Brad
Hey Brad.,Barney
I just thought of a reason.,Lily
You're probably wondering why I've been quiet all night.,Robin
"Damn it, Hordichuk! You miss another gimme like that, I'm gonna come down there and put a slapper right up your beerhole! Come on!",Robin
Not really.,Brad
"The truth is, I feel kind of weird being out with you.",Robin
"Oh, man. Is this the talk?",Brad
What?,Robin
"No, this is good. Let's get it all out of the way. Robin, I'm looking for something serious.",Brad
"No, Brad, no, it's...",Robin
"But before we go any further, you should know something about my stuff below the belt. I was born a little different.",Brad
"God, no... Brad, no... This is about me and Barney.",Robin
"You and Barn... oh, so you guys are...",Brad
"Well, we don't know what we are. I mean, my heart says leap into it. My brain says it's a bad idea.",Robin
Sounds like you guys need to have the talk.,Brad
We're not gonna have the talk.,Barney
"Would you just have the talk, okay? It's a five-minute conversation, and then you get to have sex afterwards. It's great! Back me up, Ted.",Marshall
I don't think the talk is necessary.,Ted
What?!,Marshall
"Thank you, Ted.",Barney
Because Robin is already his girlfriend.,Ted
What?!,Barney
"MacLaren's Bar, four years ago...",Ted
"How do you keep a girl from becoming your girlfriend? Simple, the rules for girls are the same as the rules for gremlins.",Barney
Gremlins?,Ted
"Gremlins. Rule number 1. Never get them wet. In otherords, don't let her take a shower at your place. Number 2. Keep them away from sunlight. I.E. Don't ever see them",Barney
What about brunch? Is brunch cool?,Ted
"No, Ted. Brunch is not cool.",Barney
"OK, new topic. How do I pick a tie?",Ted
Simple. Remember in the movie Predator...,Barney
I've done all three of those things with Robin. Is she my girlfriend?,Barney
"Just once, I wish you guys would call me on Tuxedo Night.",Marshall
"Ladies and gentlemen, time to pucker up for the New York Rangers Kiss Cam!",Voice
"Okay, how about this. If you kiss me, and you feel bad about it, you're meant to be with Barney.",Brad
Why not? Lay it on me.,Robin
Hey Brad!,Barney
"Brad, we can't fight like this all night! We both got some good shots in. Let's call a truce!",Barney
"It's okay, dude. I shouldn't go kissing some other guy's girlfriend.",Brad
"Wow, wow, wow, Girlfriend? Hey, come on.",Barney
That's putting it a bit strongly.,Robin
A bit strongly. She's not my girlfriend.,Barney
"A gifriend's a bit much, Brad, okay?",Robin
"Okay, seriously. We're at the point of physical violence. Now, will you please have the talk?",Lily
Because of that? Come on. That's my thing. I'm always punching guys. Girls... I'll punch a baby. I don't care.,Barney
"Wait. Does professor have one F or two? Oh, my God... Oh, my God! Professor. Pro-fess-or. They're all staring at me. I don't know. Just do something! Two F's. That looks right. I think that's right.",Ted
"Hey, sorry I went little too far last night.",Barney
We've been over this. Unless I say flugelhorn you haven't gone too far.,Robin
"No, I meant punching Brad.",Barney
"Right. Look, don't even worry about it. It's...",Robin
"God. The doorknob's broken off. We're locked in here. Did, did you do this?",Robin
No.,Barney
Flugelhorn. Did you do this?,Robin
"Ted, are you out there?",Robin
"Ted's not here, Robin.",Lily
"Lily, let us out of here.",Robin
I'd be glad to. Just as soon as you and Barney have the talk.,Lily
Lily! Come on. Let us out!,Robin
"No. Sit down, define the relationship, write down that definition on a piece of paper, slip it under the door, and if I like what I read, you can go.",Lily
We are not having the talk!,Barney
Then you'll die in there.,Lily
"You're gonna lock us in here? Well, guess what? Maybe we'll spend the whole day having sex!",Robin
"Well, guess what? I broughtMarshall with me, so maybe we'll do the same.",Lily
"Hey, guys.",Marshall
"Good morning. 'Sup, dudes? Silence! This is Architecture 101. I am Professor Mosby. But you can call me Ted. Professor Mosby. T-Dawg. Do not call me T-Dawg.",Ted
"Never take questions on the first day. It shows weakness. Also, don't look right here . Okay, good luck. Byesies.",Barney
Please save all your questions until the end of the lecture. Thank you! Now...,Ted
Here's your think-about-it for the day. Every single person in this room... is already an architect.,Ted
: We're just hanging out.,Marshall
Just hanging out? Not good enough.,Lily
Not good enough!,Marshall
Can anyone here tell me what this class is really all about?,Ted
"Don't laugh. He's not... He's not entirely wrong. An architect must be economical in his use of space, so... well done. Looks like someone's building towards an A.",Ted
We're seeing where things are going.,Marshall
I'll tell you where things aren't doing... out of that bedroom. Not good enough.,Lily
Not good enough!,Marshall
You... Why do you want to be an architect?,Ted
I don't want to be an architect.,Student
"Yes, exactly. It's not something you want to be. It's something you need to be. You don't have a choice, right? None of you has a choice.",Ted
No questions!,Ted
"We're Barnman and Robin.  Come on, you got to admit, that's kind of fun, Lily.",Marshall
Not... good enough.,Lily
Not good enough!,Marshall
"So if any of you have even the slightest inclination to do anything with your life other than become an architect, you're wasting my time and yours. There's the door... You can go. I'm serious. Get out, now.",Ted
Wait... Don't... all leave! Architecture's fun! Look! I brought a hacky sack!,Ted
"Sorry, sir. This is... Architecture 101. Who invited their dad, right?",Ted
"Young man, for the last 28 years, Economics 305 has been taught right here in building 14, room 7.",Professor
"Euh, yeah, but, I'm sure 200 architecture students and their professor all got the room wrong.",Ted
"T-Dawg, you're in the wrong room, bro.",Student
"Kids, out of my way! Sorry. Coming through. Excuse me. Coming through.",Ted
20 minutes late on your first day? That's rough.,Lily
"Yeah, but here's the funny thing. By that point, I didn't have time to think about what kind of teacher I was going to be. I just got up there and talked about architecture. And it was kind of great.",Ted
"That's awesome, Ted.",Lily
"Congratulations, buddy.",Marshall
Thanks.,Ted
"Nice job, Ted.",Robin
"Hey, Ted, door five! Were you there?",Barney
"Yeah, I got you, buddy.  They still haven't had the talk?",Ted
I think I know how to speed things up,Marshall
Not cool!,Robin
"Pancakes, fresh bacon. It is so yummy.",Marshall
"Dude, I'm starving. Let's... Let's just have the stupid talk. Come on.",Robin
Fine. But how do these things even work? What do we say?,Barney
"Where do you see this relationship going? My God, that sounds so cheesy.",Robin
"I know, right?",Barney
Totally. But hum... Where do you see this relationship going?,Robin
"I don't know. I mean, it's not like I don't like you. I just haven't had a girlfriend",Barney
"Mad? I feel the same way. I suck at relationships. I mean, except with Ted. He really got it right. I know it's a clich√©, but... he really ruined me for other men.",Robin
Maybe we should go back to being just friends.,Barney
Maybe. But hum... I don't want to stop having sex.,Robin
"Good. Me, neither.",Barney
Friends isn't gonna work.,Robin
We're not good at being friends. We're not good at being in a relationship. What are we good at?,Barney
I know something we're good at.,Robin
"I don't know. If we're gonna do it again, I'm gonna need some Gatorade...",Barney
"No,not that. Lying. Think about it. We spent the whole summer lying about being just friends. Why not just keep lying?",Robin
Really?,Lily
Really. We sat down. We had the talk. Barney's my boyfriend now.,Robin
"And Robin's my girlfriend. I know it sounds nuts, but it feels good to say.",Barney
"We're both afraid of commitment but... the fact is, we also can't live without each other.",Robin
"And if the alternative is not being together, then it's worth taking this risk 'cause... she's awesome.",Barney
And he's awesome. He looks nice in a suit.,Robin
She can handle her Scotch.,Barney
He's my boyfriend.,Robin
And she's my girlfriend.,Barney
Good enough!,Marshall
She bought it.,Robin
"Hook, line, and sinker. We are good.",Barney
"Totally. So, you want to get some breakfast?",Robin
"You know, brunch actually does sound kind of good.",Barney
"Well, lead the way, sweetie pie.",Robin
Flugelhorn?,Barney
"Yeah, that felt wrong.",Robin
"You do realize they were lying, right?",Ted
"No, Ted, they don't realize they weren't lying.",Lily
Hello. Hello. Good evening. Hello. Don't get up. Didn't we meet on a yacht? Hello.,Marshall
"What? Did I not tell you guys that it was Tuxedo Night? Doesn't feel very good, does it?",Marshall
Ted?,Jen
Jen?,Ted
It's nice to meet you.,Jen
"It's nice to meet you, too.",Ted
Guess who just got four tickets to the Origins of Chewbacca Star Wars exhibit?,Barney
Why?,Lily
"No, I said, Guess who?",Barney
I heard you.,Lily
"Yeah, um, isn't it a little early in our relationship to do something that would end our relationship?",Robin
"What? No, what are you talking about? It can be our first double date as couples! And plus, it sounds awesome! Is the original Chewbacca going to be there?",Marshall
"Peter Mayhew, in the fur. Who's with me?",Barney
"Hey, do you think they'll have Wookiee to English dictionaries there? I mean, even just an everyday phrase book would be helpful.",Marshall
"We're not going to the Origins of Chewbacca exhibit,Marshall. It's inHouston this year. Everyone knows that. I just wanted to get rid of the girls.",Barney
"Where are you taking me, Barney?",Marshall
"Wait a second, the Origins of Chewbacca exhibit's inMontreal this year. Everyone knows that. Where are you taking me?",Ted
My guy in the DA's office scored us front row seats to a lethal injection. But we're still stopping for chili dogs first.,Barney
Stop the cab.,Ted
Where are you taking me?,Marshall
"Barney, why are we here?",Marshall
"Marshall, now that Robin and I are together, I've learned a lot about relationships by watching you and Lily.",Barney
"Thanks, man.",Marshall
You're a terrible couple. Lily has taken all the man out of you. I used to think that's just every relationship. But what I've got with Robin proves that you can have a girlfriend and fully functioning male genitalia all at the same time.,Barney
"Okay, right. So, if Robin knew that you were here, she would be completely fine with it?",Marshall
"Are you kidding? She'd sprint down here with a purse full of singles and a poncho for the 10:30 Jell-O show. BT-Dub, I called ahead it's lime.",Barney
"So, Jen, what do you do?",Ted
I'm between jobs banking crisis.,Jen
I'm between jobs Internet bubble burst. Makes me realize I should go into something more stable... like banking. So what about you?,Jen
"I'm an architect. Hopefully, one day, I can use my own humble brush on the masterpiece that isManhattan's skyline.",Ted
"I teach architecture. Get 50% off so, that's pretty sweet.",Ted
Married!,Marshall
What is wrong with you? You're just looking. It's like fantasizing about other women. It's harmless. Wait. Don't tell me you don't fantasize about other women.,Barney
I do! It's just not that easy.,Marshall
False! I once fantasized about that silhouette chick you see on a truck's mudflaps. Took me less than a mile.,Barney
"Not everyone is you, okay, Barney? Even when I do start to have a dirty thought like that... it seems so much like cheating on Lily, that I feel guilty. So first, I need to have a different fantasy.",Marshall
Bad news. Lily has a rare and fatal hiccup disorder that's apparently medical illegitimate.,Doctor
"b*at me, but it says it right here on this doctor clipboard that doctors have.",Doctor
"It's time, baby.",Lily
I will never love again.,Marshall
"No,Marshall, you must. And after an appropriate number of years, you should find someone else. Someone like that busty delivery girl from that one time. And plow her like a cornfield.",Lily
"And so,Marshall, to honour Lily, you must find that busty delivery girl from that one time and plow her like a cornfield.",Priest
This one's for you Lily.  Where do I sign?,Marshall
"And then watch out, because it is on!",Marshall
"That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. Dude, Lily gets you in real life She has no business in your fantasies.",Barney
"It's all I know, okay? I can't, I can't help it.",Marshall
"I accept your invitation. Marshall Eriksen, from this day forward, I will be the wingman of your mind. Now, focus on the next dancer. Put Lily completely out of your mind.",Barney
"Gentlemen, say hello J-J-J-Jasmine.",Voice
Barney? Is it just me or does that stripper look exactly like...?,Marsahll
"Ted, we found a stripper who looks exactly like Lily!",Barney
"Yeah, I can't talk right now.",Ted
"I'm speechless, too. Everything's as perky as we've always imagined!",Barney
Stop looking at her.,Marshall
"Uh, look, I got to go. Take a picture.",Ted
"Oh, I will. But first, I'm going to makeMarshall watch as I wedge Ulysses S. Grant between his wife's tatas.",Barney
I'll k*ll you!,Marshall
Sorry about that.,Ted
"So, any thoughts on food?",Jen
"Yeah, do you wanna share the oysters?",Ted
I would love to share the oysters.,Jen
Good. 'Cause if you didn't......that would be mighty shellfish.,Ted
"Wow, that's bad.",Jen
That's why it's funny!,Ted
We've been on this exact blind date before.,Ted
In this exact same restaurant.,Jen
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that blind date went too well.",Ted
Me neither. I remember thinking that you were a little snobby.,Jen
"Wait, you... You dressur cats up in weird costumes.",Ted
"They're not weird. See, you're being snobby again.",Jen
"Oh, my God. Do you realize what this means? Since our first date, we've done a complete lap of all the single people inNew York only to end up back here, with each other.",Ted
"Whoa. We're going to die alone, aren't we?",Jen
"Well, you've got your cats.",Ted
This is insane.,Jen
"Wait, I got to ask. Why did you think I was snobby?",Ted
"Wait... Okay... yeah, we were sitting over there... ",Jen
"Main Lobster. They spelled Maine without the e. Good to know we're not getting the crappy understudy lobsters, right? Tonight, the role of pound-and-a-half lobster will be played by...",Ted
"I get it, Ted.",Jen
Pointing out spelling errors in a menu makes you seem kind of snooty.,Jen
Huh. I had no idea.,Ted
"Okay, well, what about me? Aside from the cats, how did I come across?",Jen
"That's right-- the check. The check came and, of course, I was going to pay, but you didn't do the check dance.",Ted
Huh. I had no idea.,Jen
"This is good. We're learning stuff. You know what we should do? We should retrace the rest of that night and figure out what else we do wrong on first dates. 'Cause let's be honest, we are scaring people off, Jen.",Ted
"We really are. Okay, I'm in.",Jen
Great.,Ted
Where'd we go next?,Jen
I think we went to MacLaren's.,Ted
Okay.,Jen
"Hey, I didn't really talk about my cats that much, did I?",Jen
"And then, there's Tabby-gail Adams, the jester of the group.",Jen
Tone down the kitty talk. Check.,Jen
You will not believe who we saw tonight.,Barney
"Dude, um...",Marshall
We saw the third doppelganger!,Barney
"Hey, hey, hey, hey! ",Barney
"Ladies, meet Stripper Lily. ",Barney
Oh!,Lily
"Yeah, I couldn't get her face in it. But she looks just like you.",Barney
So you went to a strip club?,Lily
Busted.,Barney
And there was a stripper who looked exactly like me?,Lily
"Okay, babe, look, before you get mad, let me...",Marshall
"Awesome! I bet the guys were going crazy. Oh, I bet they wanted to touch her so bad. But all you can do is look, unless you go into the back room, but honey, you got to pay for that.",Lily
So... Strip club.,Robin
Marshall made me go.,Barney
"All right, so what did I do wrong next? Let me have it. I'm here to learn.",Ted
"Well, I kept telling you I was cold, but you didn't offer me your jacket.",Jen
"It's a little brisk out tonight, huh?",Jen
Not really.,Ted
Really? I can't feel my fingers.,Jen
I'm pretty impervious to stuff like that.,Ted
I couldn't admit I was cold. I didn't want to seem like a wimp compared to your action hero ex-boyfriend who you wouldn't stop talking about.,Ted
"After a day of fighting fires, Jim would love to come home and unwind working on his '68 Camaro. That or bare-knuck boxing, which he learned in the Marine Corps.",Jen
I had an aunt in the Coast Guard.,Ted
"Okay, so no talking about the ex. Not even about his shockingly small wiener?",Jen
See? Why didn't you lead off with that?,Ted
Was there a shower on stage? Sometimes there's a shower on stage. I bet stripper me would get in there with another girl and just go bananas.,Lily
"See,Marshall? We got to have a bros' night at a strip club and both of our ladies are totally cool with it.",Barney
I'm not cool with it.,Robin
Because they understand that it's healthy for us to do that from time to time.,Barney
It's disgusting.,Robin
Because it's harmless.,Barney
Did one of your whores tell you that?,Robin
"And, Lil,Marshall shouldn't have to go to so much trouble just to have an innocent fantasy.",Barney
Trouble? What trouble?,Lily
"It's, no, it's nothing.",Marshall
"Marshall, tell her. We're all friends here.",Barney
"No, we're not.",Robin
"Lily, Sometimes I think about other women. Okay, it happens. But even when I do, I feel so guilty that I have to imagine you... passing away first, because even in a fantasy world, I could never cheat on you. You're... you're just my life, baby. And I love you.",Marshall
"You k*ll me off?! I mean, fantasize about other girls all you want, but could you maybe not m*rder me?!",Lily
"m*rder?! No! I, baby-no. You develop a chronic illness! I spare no expense for your care! I even stand up a foundation in your name. We're, like, this close to a cure.",Marshall
Remember? ,Ted
"Oh, yeah! I do remember. We went in here for a drink with your friends. Who I loved... Or hated, depending on whether you're still friends with them.",Jen
You loved them.,Ted
"They're family, Ted.",Jen
"Let's go in and see what they remember. And they are my best friends, so don't be surprised if they suddenly can't think of anything I do wrong.",Ted
Did he juggle? Bad puns? Mmm. Expect a standing ovation for picking up a $19 check,Robin
"Oh, let's not forget the menu typo gold mine. Keep pannin' that river, buddy.",Lily
"Well, it is a lot cheaper than buying a condom. Oh!",Marshall
Actually you know what it was? I remember him coming across as kind of a player.,Jen
Me?,Ted
Yeah. We were all sitting over there... ,Jen
"And here's a picture of my cats dressed up like Batman villains. You got the Joker, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze...",Jen
What about Cat Woman?,Lily
"Yeah, that would've been good.",Jen
Psst! Ted! ,Barney
Nice.,Ted
"Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no! I remember that. I was not checking out a girl.",Ted
Nice.,Ted
We were checking out Moustache Marshall.,Ted
"Gosh, I thought you were such a jerk. I'm so sorry.",Jen
"Yeah, well, it's nice to know past me wasn't a total jackass, huh?",Ted
"Present you isn't so bad, either.",Jen
Thank you very much.,Jen
You got it.,Ted
"Yes. Oh, yeah! I remember this.",Jen
"...and there's theChryslerBuilding. And the Empire State Building. And at 12:00, a rotund couple going at it against the glass.",Ted
"Aww... That's kind of sweet. Oh, look. Snack break.",Jen
"Good for them. Letting a guy eat pizza off your back, that's love. So, um... I know this wasn't the best",Ted
"Me, too.",Jen
That was really great. Wh... What went wrong?,Ted
I remember now.,Jen
Wow.,Jen
"Yeah. So would you maybe, um... want to go out again?",Ted
"Yeah, I, I would. Will you call me?",Jen
Absolutely.,Ted
Promise?,Jen
Promise.,Ted
I have been so busy.,Ted
"Good night, Ted.",Jen
Hello?,Jen
"Jen, I sorry. Look, I know I'm seven years late with this call, but I was an idiot back then. You saw the goatee. The truth is, I had a great time tonight, and I'd love to see you again.",Ted
"Ted, there are two kinds of guys. The guys that you want to call you, who don't; and the guys you don't want to call you, who always do. And somehow, right now, you're both.",Jen
"Baby... You should be able to fantasize about another woman without feeling guilty, or you know, k*ll me off.",Lily
"I wish that I could, but I've been doing this for so long, I'm all confused about death and sex. It's gotten to the pot where every time I drive past a cemetery, I'm sportin' a partial.",Marhsall
"All right, we got to fix this.",Lily
"Okay, when Stripper Lily gets out here, you have my permission to fantasize about her. And since she's basically me, maybe you won't feel guilty.",Lily
"Thanks, baby. I'm-I'm so lucky I have you. And stripper you.",Marshall
Bring out Stripper Lily!,Lily
"You know, I don't come here that much.",Barney
"Hey, Barney. He's the usual and I'll send over the other usual as soon as she's done stretching.",Waitress
"Thank you, kindly stranger.",Barney
"Ladies and gentlemen... Oh, hey, Barney. Didn't see you come in. I'll load up some AC/DC for you, buddy. Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for J-J-Jasmine.",Voice
"I am hot! Oh, crawl for it, stripper me.I is awesome. Baby, can I get another hundred?",Lily
That was a hundred?,Marshall
"Wow, she crawls fast.",Lily
"Look, Jen, I wish I could go back and talk some sense into 2002 Ted, but that guy's a lost cause. He's 24. He thinks a little facial hair makes him look like John Depp. And he has no idea what a great girl he's missing out on. But I've learned a lot since then. I've learned a lot tonight.",Ted
"The only thing that we've learned is that, seven years ago, it was mistake for us to go out. And I guess it was a mistake for us to go out tonight.",Jen
"No, it wasn't. I had a great time tonight. And seven years ago, if you think about it, we didn't miss by that much. If a couple things had gone a little bit differently... who knows what",Ted
Wow.,Jen
Wow.,Marshall
You are the best. My girlfriend is at a strip club with me and she couldn't care less.,Barney
"I do care, Barney. Look, we're dating now, okay? That changes things. We have to have a serious talk about this.",Robin
Just the best.,Barney
"Hey. Girlfriend trouble? I wish I could help, but my unbelievably cool wife just bought us a private dance with her stripper body double. So if you need me, I'll be getting grinded like some pepper, in theChampagne room.",Marshall
Just the best.,Barney
... now what?,Jen
I just remembered why I didn't call you.,Ted
Why?,Jen
"I can't believe I'm gonna screw this up again, but, um... I like finding typos in menus.",Ted
What?,Jen
And I know my shellfish pun is stupid but the truth... I'm not suddenly gonna stop making stupid jokes.,Ted
Now that you mention it... I'm never going to stop talking about my cats. They're funny and adorable and totally worth having to take six Benadryl a day.,Jen
"Shouldn't we hold out for the person who doesn't just tolerate our little quirks, but actually kind of likes them? Even if it means finding ourselves on another blind date with each other, seven years from now?",Ted
"Oh, dear God, I hope that doesn't happen.",Jen
"Well... good luck out there, Jen.",Ted
"You too, Ted. You'll find your shellfish lady.",Jen
"Hey, Lil. Looks like, uh, Jasmine's having a hard time getting out of those boots.",Marshall
"What did you say, buddy?",Lily
Lily?,Marshall
"Who? Oh, yes... I am this Lily. We married long time. May I have monies for shopping?",Lily
Lily!,Marshall
Mm-hmm. And yes... we can.,Barney
"Boyfriend. Barney Stinson is my boyfriend. I've said it, like, a hundred times it still sounds weird to say.",Robin
"Well, anything sounds weird if you say it a hundred times. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.",Ted
"But other than that, things are good?",Lily
Bowl. Bowl.,Ted
I don't know. I think Barney's been single for too long.,Robin
Bowl.,Ted
"Like, the other night, I wake up at 4:00 a.m",Robin
Bowl.,Ted
"Barney, are you awake? Barney?",Robin
Barney. This is not a one-night stand. We're dating. Come back to bed.,Robin
Bowl.,Ted
That's happened three times.,Robin
Bowl.,Ted
"And it's not just that, it's other things.",Robin
Hey. What's wrong?,Barney
"It was just one thing after another at work today, and then...  I found out my aunt's in the hospital. I'm just, I'm feeling so overwhelmed and it's just...",Robin
"Shh, shh, shh. What you need to do is talk through this stuff.",Barney
"Oh, thanks.",Robin
"And then, once you're off the phone with Lily, I'll be down in the bar ready to have sex. Mm-kay?",Barney
Bowl.,Ted
"Look, I'm not the touchy-feely-est person in the world, but... a little more effort would be nice.",Robin
Bowl. Bowl.,Ted
I understand.,Robin
Bowl.,Ted
"I guess, in a lot of ways, Barney doesn't stack up.",Lily
Bowl. Bowl.,Ted
"I mean, you've had some pretty incredible boyfriends.",Lily
Bowl. Bowl. Bowl. Bowl.,Ted
"No, that's not it.",Robin
Bowl.,Ted
I don't know.,Robin
Bowl,Ted
Maybe he just doesn't have it in him.,Robin
Bowl. Bowl.,Ted
Maybe is whole thing's a big mistake.,Robin
Bowl?,Ted
She really said that?,Barney
"And she meant it. Trust me. I dated Robin for a year-- if you don't want to lose her, you gotta try a little harder. Be more attentive to where she is emotionally. You know, just be present.",Ted
"Yes, totally. Yeah. Only thing, and this is just me--",Barney
Mm-hmm.,Ted
"I like my testicles attached to my body, rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!",Barney
He's cheating on me.,Robin
What?!,Lily
Why else would he buy me flowers? He's gettin' some on the side.,Robin
"Oh, come on, Robin. Barney's not the type of guy who would... Go on.",Lily
"Plus, he keeps saying he's working late. But when I call his office, they say he left hours ago.",Robin
"Well, that doesn't prove anything.",Lily
Yes. Proof. Go word. I'm glad you brought that up. Barney's briefcase. He forgot it here this morning. .,Robin
And what do you plan on doing with it?,Lily
"We, we-- you and I-- are going to open it up and look for evidence. Ted probably has a sledgehammer around here somewhere.",Robin
"No! Stop! Stop! Eye contact. Listen to me. Robin Scherbatsky is many things: friend, confidant, occasional guest star in some confusing dreams that remind me a woman's sexuality is a moving target. But she is no crazy, jealous stalker-bitch.  Let go.",Lily
"Hey, I've been down in the basement storage area going through all the stuff that Lily and I left behind when we moved out. I'm Robin. We should've cleared it out for you much sooner.",Marshall
There's a basement storage area?,Robin
"Oh, you're not upset. Good. Baby, guess what I found.",Marshall
"Oh, that's great, honey.",Lily
What the hell is that?,Robin
Marshall got it in college. He used it as a nightstand for years.,Lily
Until we found out that Lily was allergic to barrel resin,Marshall
Barrel resin?,Robin
Just go with it.,Lily
So you need a hand throwing it out?,Robin
"No, I'm not... I'm not just going to throw her out, okay? Mabel's like family.",Marshall
"So, um, what are you gonna do with Mabel?",Robin
"I want to give her away, um, to a lucky new owner. Do you know anyone?",Marshall
"Yeah, hmm, let me think. Do I know any rodeo clowns? Oh, that's weird, I do. But even Lenny wouldn't go near that mess.",Robin
"Well, he's not going to have the chance, because I am putting old Mabel in the Bermuda Triangle.",Marshall
This is so exciting. Right now there's some out there who has no idea that tonight they're going home with just... just the best barrel.,Marshall
"Well, let's just hope they're not allergic to barrel sin like Lily here.",Robin
"Be cool, baby. Damn!  See you, sweetie. Good luck.",Lily
"Bye, babe.",Marshall
"Now, can we please get out of here?",Lily
Yeah. I'll grab my coat.,Robin
Oops.,Robin
A college notebook?!,Lily
"Oh, my God, he's cheating on me with some college girl. I knew there was a skank but I thought she'd at least be dumb. Birthday: July 23.Favorite hockey team: the Vancouver Canucks. Age: 29, but tells people that she's 26. Oh, my God,these are notes about me. Or some 29-year-old version of me.",Robin
I hope I'm not too late! I want to see the look of joy on the new owner's face!,Marshall
"She's still there! Okay Mabel, let's find you a new home. Here comes a guy! And he... he just walked, walked right on by it. He's probably rushing home to get a handcart or something. Yeah! Hey, better hurry up, pal. What are you guys doing with Barney's secret Robin notebook? Let me rephrase that. Did you two ladies lose some weight?",Marshall
"What do you know about this,Marshall?",Lily
Why would Barney have a notebook full of information about me?,Robin
Well...,Marshall
Welcome to Robin 101.,Ted
Why is Ted teaching a class about me? It all started a few weeks ago.,Robin
...rather than rolling around next to some eyeliner in Robin's purse. Stinson out!,Barney
"Stinson back in. Say, hypothetically, I did want to change who I am to become a better boyfriend to Robin, which I do not! What kind of changes are we talking about?",Barney
"Why, I mean, there's just so much you need to know about her. Okay, for starters, don't ever cry in front her.",Ted
Okay.,Barney
"And whatever you do, don't cry in front of her four times.",Ted
"Hey, guys. What you talking about?",Robin
"They realized they couldn't talk about this stuff at the bar, and since you live with Ted, they had to find someplace safe. So... Ted's classroom.",Marshall
"How To Date Robin Scherbatsky. Lesson one. Now, even though she puts up a tough exterior, what Robin really wants, deep down...",Ted
I'm bored.,Barney
You said you wanted my help.,Ted
Can we draw boobs on the chalkboard?,Barney
We did that ready.,Ted
"No, like, really big boobs.",Barney
"No. Look, I need this, too. I've only been a professor a few weeks. Being up here, it's, it's good practice for me.",Ted
Can we have class outside?,Barney
No! What Robin really wants deep down...,Ted
Barney!,Ted
What? I'm tweeting about you. You should be flattered. How do you spell blah-blah-blah- H's or no?,Barney
"Wow, you were just, like, the worst student in the world, weren't you?",Ted
They said I had A-D... something. Can we have class outside?,Barney
"Barney, I'm only gonna say this once, so listen up. I love you and I love Robin. And I want to make this work. So if you give me a few weeks of attention, I could give you a lifetime of happiness. Can you do that for me?",Ted
Do you think I should get Sports Illustrated for 70% off the cover price? Can we have class outside? I got to find a way to reach this kid.,Barney
Class number two.,Lily
Top Ten Robin Scherbatsky Facial Expressions and Their Meaning.,Robin
"Now, notice the vacant eyes, the pale, queasy expression, suggesting nausea. What do these mean?",Ted
You guys just had sex? Oh! Wasn't me.,Barney
"Dude! I worked really hard on these slides, okay? Can we just...",Ted
Okay.,Barney
"This look is hunger. If you ever see Robin looking like this, get some food in her quick,or one of two things will happen. One: weird, out-of-context laughter.  Or two: spontaneously falling to sleep in strange places. But the most important facial expression of all?",Ted
That's a building.,Barney
Oh...  That's for my class. TheFlatironBuilding. Fun story about it. It was designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style; this architectural gem...,Ted
Dude!,Barney
Right. The most important facial expression of all.,Ted
Whoa...,Barney
"Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. If you ever, ever see this face, Barney, run. And don't take a picture of it. She will punch you. And you will cry... for the third time... that night. Which brings us to an important point: defusing the b*mb.",Ted
Defusing the b*mb? What does that even mean?,Robin
Three Topics To Distract Robin From Being Mad At You.,Lily
"Distract me? Oh, that is so condescending. These guys are really starting to piss me off!",Robin
"Immediately switch the conversation To one of the following, unless you want Robin to start throwing her shoes.",Lily
One. Vancouver Canucks 2004 Division Title.,Ted
"What?! That's not distracting. That's just talking about the story of a scrappy little underdog team that prevailed despite very shaky goal ending and, frankly, the declining k*ll of Trevor Linden.",Robin
Two: Proper g*n Cleaning and Maintenance.,Ted
"You have to clean your g*n. My uncle had a filthy old g*n, blew both his thumbs off trying to sh**t a beaver. You want to distract someone, make them watch my uncle try to eat corn on the cob.",Robin
Three: Emperor Penguins.,Ted
"Did you know that before intercourse, the male and female emperor penguins bow to each other? Mr. Penguin . Mrs. Penguin . Oh, God, silly penguins, acting all fancy.  What were we talking about?",Robin
"Neither can you, sweetie.",Lily
"Well, he doesn't know that, baby! God!",Marshall
Ted's only teaching Barney horrible things about me.,Robin
I don't know. Check this out. This is actually kind of sweet.,Lily
"Now, we all know Robin's not what you'd call touchy-feely. She doesn't say, I love you, like a normal person. Instead, she'll laugh, shake her head, give you a little smile and say, You're an idiot.",Ted
You're an idiot?,Barney
"Yup. If she tells you you're an idiot, you're a lucky man. And if she does say I love you, she's already broken up with you in her mind.",Ted
I think 's nice that Ted knows you that well.,Lily
"Ah, well, too bad it's next to a page entitled...",Robin
Robin Scherbatsky's Surprising Erogenous Zones. Right knee-- ticklish. Left knee...,Ted
Does lefty like that?,Ted
"Oh, yeah...lefty like that.",Ted
"I can't believe I'm taking sexual advice from Ted Mosby. That's like taking fashion advice from... well, Ted Mosby.",Barney
"Oh, here's a good one. Top Five Things Never to Do Around Robin.",Lily
"Three: Never, ever play the 'Guess Who' game with her.",Ted
What do you mean?,Barney
Guess who?,Ted
It's me! It's me! It's me!,Ted
"Number four: Unless you want to see it 80 times a day, for the next month, never show Robin a YouTube clip of an animal playing a musical instrument.",Ted
Barney! Do you have a problem with this class?,Ted
"Yeah, it's boring as hell and I'm not learning anything.",Barney
"Uh, well, maybe the problem is your attitude. You're not listening to a word I say.",Ted
"Uh-huh. Uh, can you hear this, Professor?  Or should I turn it up for you? .",Barney
"Oh, you think you're not learning anything, huh? Okay. Pop quiz.",Ted
What...,Barney
"When Robin's PMS-ing, what kind of chocolate should you get her?",Ted
Trick question. Get her butterscotch.,Barney
Correct! Why?,Ted
Butterscotch is to Canadian women what chocolate is to American women.,Barney
Correct! What is Robin's dream job?,Ted
To become the most successful female TV journalist of all time.,Barney
"Correct! And if she achieves that, will she truly be happy?",Ted
"No! Robin's deep-seated need for attention can traced back to her father's emotional distance, and no amount of success will ever make up for what she truly needs, which is six simple words from her Dad: Robin, I'm proud of you, eh?",Barney
Yes! But I guess you're right. You haven't learned anything. Sorry to have wasted your time.,Ted
"Oh, Captain! My Captain!",Barney
How good was Dead Poet's Society?,Ted
"I know, right? The end? Tears.",Barney
"Okay, can I just say that my deepest need in life not to have my father to say, I am proud of you, eh?",Robin
So why are you crying now?,Marshall
I'm not crying.,Robin
"Oh, sweetie. Can I get you some butterscotch?",Lily
"Oh, stop it.",Robin
Wait a second. It says here that the class meets at 6:15 on Tuesday.,Robin
So?,Lily
That's right now.,Robin
"Now, as you can see, well over 50% of the blankets have been dragged onto her side. Make no mistake. Robin Scherbatsky is a classic, textbook... cover hog. Any questions?",Ted
"Yeah, I have one.",Robin
"Yes, Robin?",Ted
"Flared nostril ridges. Wide, unblinking eyes. Uh-oh.",Ted
"I got this. So, emperor penguins-- crazy, huh?",Barney
What the hell do you two think you're doing?,Robin
"Marshall, did you sells out?",Barney
"I was vulnerable, I said good-bye to a very dear friend today.",Marshall
"Dude, it's a barrel!",Robin
Aw! You're giving Mabel away?,Ted
I have so many questions. Why would you do this? What were you thinking? Who the hell is that guy? .,Robin
"Oh, that's Shin-Ya. He's sort of been auditing the class.",Ted
Auditing?,Robin
"Well, tried to explain to him it wasn't a real class, but I don't think he speaks much English.",Ted
"On the bright side, he came in handy standing in for you during the role-playing exercises.",Barney
Wait. You did role-playing exercises where I was played by Shin-Ya?,Robin
"They made me wear a wig, It was very demeaning.",Shin-ya
"You know, I can't believe you, Ted. You actually think you're some kind of an expert on me?",Robin
Hey! He is an expert. He's a great teacher!,Barney
: Kiss ass.,Lily
"You know, half the stuff in this notebook is patently wrong.",Robin
"Uh, really? Name one wrong thing.",Ted
"Robin Scherbatsky's Surprising Erogenous Zones? Let me clear something up for you, Ted.",Robin
Does lefty like that?,Ted
Oh. Yeah...,Robin
Don't wanna leave out the righty.,Ted
"Oh, uh, no. Um, the right one's ticklish, I guess. But the left one, yeah, I'm glad you're back there. Because that is just some sweet, sweet lovin'.",Robin
Noted.,Ted
That was a lie?,Ted
We had just started dating. I was being nice.,Robin
"And you. You know, I got it into my head this week that you were cheating on me. I even broke open your briefcase to look for evidence.",Robin
That is a huge violation of my privacy! Go on.,Barney
"You know, in a way, I was right. You cheated. You can't get some crib sheet on dating me. That's not how it works. If we didn't figure out how to be with each other in a real, honest way, I don't see the point of even trying.",Robin
What do you want?,Robin
Look. All that stuff I told Barney... It was personal between you and me. I'm really sorry.,Ted
I guess I'm impressed by how much you remembered.,Robin
"It's funny. When you date someone, it's like you're taking one long course in who that person is and then, when you break up, all that stuff becomes useless. It's the emotional equivalent of an English degree. I guess I just liked the idea of putting all my Robin Scherbatsky knowledge to good use, you know?",Ted
"Well, since you know me pretty well... am I fooling myself with this whole Barney thing?",Robin
"I don't know. I will say this, though. I've seen Barney work very hard to get women. I've seen him work very hard to get rid of women. I've never seen him work this hard to keep one around. I was going to give him an A. Well, B+ -- Shin-Ya kind of screwed up the curve.",Ted
"Hey. Before you say anything, I am done with this stupid Robin 101, okay? Here, I'll get rid of the notebook.  But there's... there's something that I did want to say to you. Robin, I have been with a lot of women, blondes, brunettes, redheads, big boobs, small",Barney
You're an idiot.,Robin
You know...,Robin
Hmm?,Barney
"That notebook, um, does contain a lot of personal info, and I think it has my home address.",Robin
And your work address.,Barney
Whoa.,Barney
"Hey, guys! If you don't want the barrel, can you sit somewhere else? You're scaring away potential takers.",Marsahll
"Designed byChicago's Daniel Burnham in the beaux arts style, this architectural gem was the first of its kind...",Ted
"Uh, Professor Mosby?",Student
"Yes, Susan?",Ted
That's a woman drinking beer on the toilet.,Student
"Right. That-That... was Daniel Burnham's wife. She was a troubled, troubled woman. We are moving on.",Ted
"Ah, tweed. Textile of the eunuch.",Barney
"You know, I've always wondered why those tweed jackets have elbow patches.",Marshall
"Because the people who wear them are constantly going, Aw, geez, why can't I get laid?",Barney
You are wrong. The ladies dig the professor look.,Ted
"You know, there is something to that. I remember thinking my tenth grade math teacher was very sexy. I wonder if Harold's still in jail. What? Tax evasion. Among other things.",Robin
"So guys, Marshall and I wanted to invite you to our place for a little couples' night.",Lily
"Uh, sure. Why not?",Robin
Welcome.,Lily
Gouda?,Marshall
"This is great. We're having fun. You're having fun, right?",Lily
"So, should we just go ahead and lock the four of us in for new year's?",Marshall
"Um, it's April.",Guy
Right. Sorry. We're getting ahead of ourselves. Let's talk Thanksgiving.,Marshall
Our parents really want to meet you!,Lily
"Well, we should probably be going.",Guy
"Wait. But, wait, if you leave now, Colonel mustard just gets away with it.",Marshall
It's getting pretty late. We're going to go.,Woman
There's still pie.,Lily
Tonight was fantastic. We should do it again.,Marshall
"I'm sorry, Marshall, but g*n and I are just not that into you. And you.",Man
Wohoo!,Lily
Marshall and I wanted to invite you to our place for a little couples' night.,Lily
"Um, sure, why not?",Robin
Okay. Game time. Let's review the flow of the room.  Barney and Robin enter here. Stop here for margaritas. That's a great conversation starter. We can tell them about nour trip to Cabo.,Lily
"Great, 'cause I got that story about Sammy Hagar Anthe Belgian waffle locked and loaded.",Marshall
"Then we'll move on to the hot apps station. And, depending on how things are going, Some lively pre-dinner charades.",Lily
"Right, but, uh, we'll play that one by... ",Marshall
Sounds like?,Lily
"Okay, you can be Robin's partner.",Marshall
"Oh... Baby, we can do this.",Lily
Welcome.,Lily
Gouda?,Marshall
So is it hard to grade papers?,Girl
"No, you've just got to make it fun. For example, uh, every time I spot a grammatical error, I do a sh*t. I'm trashed right now, and I blame our public school system.",Ted
"So, you said you live right upstairs...",Girl
Take care. Bye.,Lily
Nailed it!,Lily
Best night ever!,Marshall
Worst night ever.,Barney
"Hey, how was the big couples' night with Marshall and Lily?",Ted
Brutal.,Robin
Really? How?,Ted
"It was like we were on a date with a sad, chubby girl our mom made us call.",Barney
"And they were so nervous, that they weren't even making sense half of the time.",Robin
Hey. Come on in. Would you like a margarita?,Lily
"In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar eating a Belgian waffle!",Marshall
And they kept shoving platters of food in our faces.,Barney
"Let me guess: Did Marshall get, like, super intense about the cheese?",Ted
"Yeah, how'd you know?",Robin
"Poor Marshall., Lily's this gourmet cook, and all she letsMarshall do ss pick out one sad block of cheese.",Ted
That's prosciutto-wrapped melon.,Lily
You guys are going to want to get in on thisgouda.,Marshall
That's seared scallops with a mango chutney.,Lily
"Seriously, don't sleep on thegouda.",Marshall
And that's Lobster ravioli in a black truffle oil.,Lily
Ooh...Tick-tock goes thegouda clock.,Marshall
"Um, we-we-we didn't realize there was gonna be dinner. We sucked down a couple tacos outside the subway.",Barney
"P.S., not sitting great.",Robin
"And if anything didn't go according to plan, they would freak out.",Barney
"What do you mean, the egg timer is broken? What are we going to use for charades, sweetie?",Lily
"I'm working on it, darling. Okay? Just stall them.",Marshall
"Now, Robin... You work in television. We're experiencing some technical difficulties. : You get that? We're still laughing. Right? Laugh,Marshall.",Lily
"Come on, they just got excited. They've been looking for couple best friends forever. Plus, I'm sure they weren't that bad.",Ted
Show him.,Robin
This is a web siteMarshall already made about last night.  It's called itwasthebestnightever.com.,Barney
"oh, that's not good.",Ted
"Needless to say, we've both changed our e-mail addresses.",Barney
"I don't understand. If last night went so horribly, why do Lily and Marshall think it was such a hit?",Ted
"I mean, we knew we were gonna have fun tonight, but we had no idea how much.",Barney
Oh.,Marshall
"Yeah, tough luck, every Saturday night I've ever had, 'cause this one just blew you out of the water.",Robin
"Let's do it again, soon.",Barney
"Yeah, we'll call you.",Robin
They're your friends! Why would you just blatantly lie to them like that?,Ted
"Well, that's what you say at the end of a crappy date.",Robin
"Hey, Ted. Great time last night. Well, let's do it again, soon. I'll...uh, call you.",Girl
Right?,Ted
Who was that?,Robin
"Oh, I don't want to brag, But it seems chicks are really digging the whole professor thing. Last night, she picked me up at the bar. And then... Well, she actually wound up falling asleep on the couch. But, hey, that happens.",Ted
"Uh, no, it doesn't.",Barney
"Sure, it does. You know, she was, she was just exhausted from being turned on. But you heard her. She wants to do it again, soon.",Ted
"Ted, let me ask you a question. Where does this girl live, exactly?",Barney
Westchester. Why?,Ted
You're the sexless innkeeper.,Barney
"Oh, my god! You're right! He's totally the sexless innkeeper!",Robin
What the hell is the sexless innkeeper?,Ted
"Ted, many a man--nay, many a soul--has their own tale of the sexless innkeeper. Why, I had run-in with one just last year. I even composed a poem about it. Would you care to hear it?",Barney
Not really.,Ted
"T'was the night before new year's, and the weather grew mean. It was 3:00 in the morning, And I was stranded in queens.  The tavern grew empty, the gas lights grew dim. The horse-drawn carriages were all but snowed in...",Barney
"Wait. If this was last year, why are you acting like it was Oliver Twist?",Ted
"Ted, it's a poem. Last call was approaching, and my fortunes looked bleak. Then I turned to my left and stifled a shriek. She had a peach fuzz beard and weighed 16 stone. She gobbled up hot wings and swallowed the bones. I muffled a scream and threw up in my mouth.I asked, where do you live?And she said, one block south.. I swallowed my pride and six shots of whiskey. And prayed to the gods that she wasn't too frisky. Back in her cave, she prepared us a snack. 'neath her mighty hooves, the floorboards did crack. But when she returned, she found a sound sleeper. And thus she became the sexless innkeeper. And so are you",Barney
"Wait, you're saying that girl just used me for a place to crash?",Ted
"Ted, you mentioned that you live right upstairs. She saw the tweed jacket",Barney
No way.,Ted
"I'm not the sexless innkeeper. Ted, that girl had no intention of ever hooking up with you.",Barney
"Which is funny, because usually it's the innkeeper who offers turndown service. Oh!",Robin
"Hey, guys. Good news. First of all, you can ignore all the e-mails and texts we've sent you.",Lily
We have. Go on.,Robin
Because we went ahead and booked that couples' weekend for all of us inVermont!,Lily
"Wait, you guys were serious about that?",Robin
"Oh, we never joke about b&amp;b's, especially at the height of syrup season.",Marshall
"Check it out. Saturday we've got apple-picking, antiquing, then a hated hay ride.",Lily
"And then on Sunday, we're up at 6:00 a.m. for the fall foliage hike. Now, you better pack your long johns, 'cause it is cold up there.",Marshall
"Look! I'm sorry that we have been dodging your calls, but we respect you guys too much as friends to give you some song and dance. You deserve the truth.  The US Navy has found intelligent alien life at the bottom of the ocean. For reasons I can't explain, Robin and I have been tapped to lead the expedition.",Barney
"Wow, Barney. That kind of sounds like the stuff you say to girls when you're too much of a coward to dump them.",Lily
"Yeah. You know, that's exactly what it sounds like. But if that's true, that's awesome.",Marshall
What's going on?,Lily
"Look, all the couple-y stuff, it's just not us. Barney and I are barely equipped to date each other, let alone you guys.",Robin
"Plus, the alien thing.",Barney
"Come on,Marshall.",Lily
Let's go.,Marshall
No...Lily...,Robin
You know what? I hope those underwater aliens are cold-blooded. 'cause then you guys will get along just fine.,Marshall
I think they bought it.,Barney
I can't believe they broke up with us.,Marshall
We're so lovable.,Lily
"No, we're not. We're ugly and gross.",Marshall
I thought we did everything right.,Lily
I know! I know. We had thegouda. We had my waffle story. I even sent them a awesome photo montage. Nothing.,Marshall
"Oh, dear god.Marshall, we've been over and over this. You have to stop sending those to people.",Lily
"Cat-sitting for Lily's mom, cat-sitting for Lily's mom, it's gonna be fun, it's gonna bring us all closer together. ",Marshall
"Cat funeral, cat funeral, it was an accident and not entirely my fault, cat funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow, ca funeral, meow, meow, meow, meow. We'll miss you, whiskers, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow...",Marshall
I can't believe you sent them one of those. They think we're insane now.,Lily
"If I recall, they didn't dump us until you brought up thatVermont trip. It was way too early. First, a boat ride around the city, then a trip toVermont. It's a rookie mistake, and you're better than that.",Marshall
"Oh, what about you forgetting to check the egg timer for charades? I gave you one thing to do,Marshall. One thing.",Lily
"One thing?  One thing? Wow. Really? So, I guess that gouda Just walked itself right through the door...Sliced itself up, and arranged itself in a perfect semi-circle around not three, not four... But five different kinds of sturdy, cheese-bearing crackers?",Marshall
"You're a sturdy, cheese-bearing cracker!",Lily
"Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't been to the bar all week. They're taking this really hard.",Ted
"Ted, I could listen to this guilt trip all day, But don't you have to get back up to the inn? I mean, who's working the front desk?",Barney
"Seriously, they're your friends. You got to go apologize.",Ted
"To your point, Ted, as an innkeeper. Do you do that cheapy thing where you only change the linens upon request? I mean, I mean, I mean, how much water is that actually saving?",Barney
"Robin, you know I'm right. Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away. Usually, it just makes it bigger.",Ted
You're right.,Robin
Thank you.,Ted
All that sexlessness has made you wise.,Robin
For god's sake!,Ted
"Mint on the pillow, Ted! And don't charge for wi-fi. It seems greedy! It does.",Barney
Hey. We wanted to say we're sorry.,Robin
Oh. I wish you had called.,Lily
"I swear, he was right there just eating a Belgian waffle!",Marshall
"Well, he can't have enjoyed it as much as I'm enjoying thisgouda!",Guy
Oh!,Marshall
"Um, listen, now's not a good time. We'll call you.",Lily
Wait. We just want...,Robin
"Hey! Hey, guys.",Marshall
Hey. Long time no see. Have a seat.,Barney
"Oh, we can't. We're here with Py and Shea.",Lily
"Yeah, sorry.",Marshall
"Oh, it's just... We haven't seen you guys all week.",Robin
"Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out.",Barney
Yeah.,Robin
"Oh, it might be weird. We're kind of on a double date. Wouldn't want you to feel like a fifth and sixth wheel.",Lily
Who the hell are these people?,Barney
They just moved here fromHawaii. Py is a total foodie,Lily
Mmm!,Marshall
"And Shea, well... She's...",Lily
Shea...Shea is just...,Marshall
"Anyhoo, we can't stay long. We're just gonna grab a quick beer and then take these kooks for a boat ride around the city.",Lily
"Wow, it sounds like this is getting pretty serious.",Robin
"Well, we don't want to jinx it, but, uh... We kind of think they might be the two.  Ooh.",Marshall
"Pfft, who needs 'em?",Robin
Pfft. Not us.,Barney
Hi. Two for dinner.,Robin
Just the two of you?,Woman
"Hey, why don't we call that weird couple down the hall from you? You know, with the ferrets? Maybe they want to come over and play taboo.",Barney
"After midnight? No way. We can't tabooty-call them, it's pathetic.",Robin
"Hey, guys.",Ted
"Barney, are you wearing sweat pants?",Ted
Maybe. But they're Armani.,Barney
"Okay, guys, I've got some bad news for you. So I'm just going to come out and say it. You're a couple. And no matter how hard you try to fight it, couples need other couples. That's why you miss Marshall and Lily. And can't you just admit that?",Ted
"Oh, yeah!",Marshall
"That was amazing, Lily!",Girl
"I know! When I got that left-hand- yellow, I was like, what?!",Lily
You guys are the best.,Guy
"Oh, right back at you!",Marshall
For charades.,Robin
How do we know you two won't hurt us again?,Lily
You don't.,Robin
You know what? We have two very nice people up in that apartment Who are perfect for us.,Marshall
"Then what are you doing, standing out in the rain with us?",Barney
Damn it. Why is there something so attractive about a bad boy... And girl?,Lily
I think we can change them.,Marshall
"Come here, you two.",Lily
We'll never sleep on thegouda again.,Barney
"Hey, Barney. I got a little poem for you. You want to hear it?",Ted
"No, not really.",Barney
"'twas the night before, I had hours to k*ll.  I sat in the tavern, grading parchments with quill.",Ted
With quill?,Barney
"Barney. It's a poem. A busty, young lassie flashed me a grin. Her garb said classy, but her eyes whispered sin. She said, you're a teacher? I said, yes, indeed. I must have you, she moaned.I'm turned on by tweed. With haste we did scamper to my chamber anon. We fell to the couch, and, bro, it was on. I unlaced her bodice. Our passions grew deeper. And thus ends the tale of the sexless innkeeper.",Ted
No way. You made that up.,Barney
"Are you coming back bed, professor?",Girl
Whew!,Barney
"God, I love being single.",Ted
"Barney, you ready for brunch with Lily and Marshall?",Robin
What have I done?,Marshall
"Okay, let's do this!",Robin
"Ted, this hydro bill is bigger than Louis Cyr's biceps. What, you leave the garburator on all night, eh?",Robin
You want to go? You want to go?! Come on! ,Fighting
The... mmm. Social experiment. ,Barney
"Okay, okay. You know what, what does that even prove, okay? You chant anything, people we join in. ",Robin
No!,Marshall
What Gazzola's?,Robin
"A filthy mecca of spectacular if undercooked pizza located at 316 Kinzie Street, Chicago, Illinois.",Ted
"Back in college, Ted and I used to take these crazy road trips from Connecticut all the way to Chicago just for Gazzola's pizza.",Marshall
"22 hours. No map. We'd just jump in the Fiero and drive. We were like Lewis and Clark, if Lewis and Clark peed in empty soda bottles and had a bong made out of a cantaloupe.",Ted
"Man, those Gazzola trips, that's... that's when we really became bros.",Marshall
Mm. We ate nothing but jerky.,Ted
Drank nothing but Tantrum.,Marshall
"Oh, man, we went through a whole case of Tantrum one trip.",Marshall
I was color blind for two weeks after that.,Ted
I think that's the reason that I pass out when I hear church bells.,Marshall
"It's probably a good thing they're closing Gazzola's. Those trips were brutal, right? The long hours in the car, the motion sickness, the smell.",Ted
So what time are we leaving for Gazzola's tomorrow?,Marshall
"I was thinking 9:00, 9:30.",Ted
"I am ready to hit the road. I got baby wipes. I got a variety of jerky. I got six cans of Tantrum. Well, four. One b*rned though the can, the other one I drank already. ",Ted
What do you mean?,Barney
Think about it.,Ted
"Hey, haven't seen you all week. How you doing?",Ted
Do you watch the Jets game?,Ted
We most certainly did.,Marshall
How'd things go at the doctor?,Ted
We no longer have a hemorrhoid problem.,Marshall
Hmm.,Barney
You guys will not believe this. I've been talking to my lawyer all morning. You know that guy I have a slight disagreement with at the Hoser Hut? He's filing as*ault charges.,Robin
Come on!,Robin
"I broke his nose with a chair. And now, apparently, I may end up getting deported.",Robin
"Oh, my God, that sucks! Yeah. I'm gonna go do push-ups in the kitchen. Tantrum!",Ted
"Well, there's only one possible way to avoid getting deported. My lawyer said I could become an American citizen.",Robin
Perfect. Problem solved. Welcome aboard.,Barney
"Well, it's not that simple. I'm a Canadian. I was born there. My family's there. It's who I am.",Robin
"I know, and it's provided us with a lot of laughs. But, Robin, if you want to live here, work here and throw chairs at people here, you have to do this.",Barney
"Well, there's a citizenship test tomorrow.",Robin
A cit...,Barney
I'll think about it.,Robin
"No, no, you have to do it. I'll help you study. We're gonna stay up all night long. I'm gonna drill you, and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna do some cramming and then we're gonna study. No, seriously. We're gonna bone up on...",Barney
"Okay, Barney.",Robin
Sorry. It's a rich area.,Barney
It is.,Robin
"But you know, it's not going to be easy, this test. It's not like the Canadian citizenship test.",Barney
How do you know the Canadian test is easy?,Robin
It's Canada. Question one: Do you want to be Canadian? Question two: really?,Barney
"Yes, I do! I don't why they make phone books anymore. Everything's online, right?",Ted
Tantrum!,Marshall
Tantrum!,Ted
"All right, let's hit the road.",Lily
You invited Lily?,Ted
We most certainly did!,Marshall
"I don't know if you caught that, but he did the we thing.",Barney
"Yeah, I heard him.",Ted
Okay.,Barney
Road trip! So you guys want to talk about bitches? I'm kidding. They're called women.,Lily
"All right, next stop: Chicago.",Ted
I have to pee.,Lily
Couldn't you have gone before we left?,Ted
I did. I just pee a lot. You'll see.,Lily
"Don't worry, we'll get out on the road, it'll be just like old times.",Marshall
"Sugar snap pea? Pea... That reminds me, I have to pee.",Lily
"Okay, straight, straight, straight. Now, wait, a little to the left. We'll pass a state trooper.",Ted
Ow!,Ted
"Yellow, that reminds me, I have to pee.",Lily
Thank you!,Ted
"Great. Oh, hey, Ted...",Lily
You can't have to go again. It's not humanly possible.,Ted
"No, I was just going to say maybe we should listen to something.",Lily
"Oh, that's a great idea. I think I have some Jerky Boys.",Ted
"Goodbye, Sparky.",Marshall
It's an audio book about a boy and his dog. It made Elisabeth Hasselbeck cry.,Lily
"Goodbye Sparky, by Nick Leotti. Read to you by Kenny Rogers.",Voice
Oh!,Marshall
"Chapter one: When I first saw Sparky, he reminded me of my favorite comb; he was missing a lot of teeth, but I loved him anyway. Mother was fit to be tied every time he used her prized rhododendron to do his business.",Kenny
"That reminds me, I have to pee.",Lily
How many stars are on the flag?,Barney
"50, one for each state.",Robin
What are the first ten amendments to the Constitution called?,Barney
"The Bill of Rights. Look, Barney, I know all this. I'm ready.",Robin
"Ready for the test maybe, but ready to be an American? Not on your sweet life. For you to be an American, we got to get the Canadian out of you. That's why I've created these questions. Question one: Who is this?",Barney
Queen Elizabeth II.,Robin
"No, the answer is Elton John. Question two: What the hell is this?",Barney
"Oh, curling. Um, it's a sport played...",Robin
"Wrong. The answer we were looking for was I don't care, it's dumb. Let's go buy something that's bad for us and then sue the people who made it. That's America, Robin.",Barney
"...because Sparky loved chasing a ball, and it didn't much matter what kind. Tennis ball, baseball, Wiffle ball, golf ball, basketball, beach ball, gum ball, a grapefruit- which isn't actually a ball, but's round like a ball- a football- which isn't round, but it's still technically a ball- Indian rubber ball...",Kenny
This ends disk seven. The audio book continues on disk eight. ,Voice
"Lacrosse ball, volleyball...",Kenny
"Oh, my God, Lily, please tell me you have to go pee!",Ted
"Ah, I do.",Lily
"Well, don't worry, the next exit's the hotel. We can go there.",Marshall
Hotel?,Ted
"Crumpet Manor is listed in the American Registry of Historic Bed and Breakfasts. Our door is opened on Christmas day, 1881. And we have catered to couples ever since.",Woman
"Well, I mean, single people can have fun here, too, right?",Marshall
"Oh, I suppose I could arrange a little recreation. Do you enjoy sitting on a bench?",Woman
I want to say- Jefferson?,Robin
Correct.,Barney
Oh!,Robin
Archie Bunker's neighbor was George Jefferson.,Barney
"Oh, boo-ya! I am nailing this. God, I'm buzzing on America right now!",Robin
"All right, hold your horses. Now to prove that you are as American as apple pie and the childhood obesity it leads to- who is this?",Barney
"That, Barney, is the American actor, beloved by millions, the Hey, Vern guy from the popular series of Ernest films. And his name... Jeff Foxworthy.",Robin
"Jeff Foxworthy? No, it's Jim Varney. You're kidding me. You don't know that?",Barney
"Uh, that's Jeff Foxworthy, dumbass. End of story. Now shut your stupid face.",Robin
"Not only are you wrong, but you are belligerently sticking to your g*n and insulting me in the process. Robin Scherbatsky- you are an American.",Barney
Look who's back from the wishing well.,Woman
"It didn't work, I'm still here. Marshall, what are we doing? We should be on the road.",Ted
"Ok, Ted, we're not in college anymore, okay? We don't have to drive all night.",Marshall
"Besides, they have a spa. What kind of treatments do you offer?",Lily
"All our spa treatments are designed for couples. Would you be interested in the two person, cornmeal body scrub?",Woman
Whoa. I got to dial back on the Tantrum.,Ted
"Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be an American, y'all. ",Robin
"Hey, man.",Ted
Shh.,Marshall
Sorry about what I said before. You want to go to the store and get some beer?,Ted
Lily is asleep. I suppose I could reschedule my pedicure. What the hell? But only light beer because we have a couple hike in the morning.,Marshall
"Dude, why are we pulling to the highway? Ted, where exactly are we going to get this beer?",Marshall
Chicago.,Ted
"What are you doing? We can't just leave Lily. When she wakes up, she's going to freak!",Marshall
She'll have a back rub and a crumpet. She'll be fine. Relax. Have some fun.,Ted
I just abandoned my wife. How am I supposed to have fun?,Marshall
"Hey, you really think Lily's pissed?",Ted
"If she's pissed, she's pissed.",Marshall
Pfft.,Ted
Good morning.,Barney
"Barney? Oh, my God. What happened last night?",Robin
You went Canadian.,Barney
How Canadian?,Robin
This Canadian. ,Barney
"Oh, God. Okay. It's coming back to me. I, uh, I went into the Hoser Hut... And I met this women's curling team.",Robin
"We started drinking. And the next thing I know, they're inviting me to a Bryan Adams/Rich title double bill in Toronto.",Robin
"How did you find me, anyway?",Robin
"You called me, said you were never coming back. So, I jumped on a plane, flew across the Atlantic...",Barney
Canada isn't across the Atlantic.,Robin
"You're talking nonsense. Now, listen... You slipped up. It's fine. The test is in a few hours.",Barney
"Barney, I'm not taking the test.",Robin
"God, you're still drunk.",Barney
"Look, I appreciate your help, but... who am I kidding? I'm Canadian. I always will be.",Robin
"Now, that's ridiculous. We're gonna get some coffee, in you, we'll sober you up, and get you back to New York for that test. But, before any of that, we're gonna do it on this bed 'cause... hotel room. Okay, let's get some coffee.",Barney
Kind of cross.,Ted
You're making me wonder if this pizza is worth the 22 hour drive.,Marshall
Just like old times!,Ted
I feel so young again except for the chest pains.,Marshall
But the crust is so good. What is the secret to this crust?,Ted
It's no big secret. It's made of cornmeal.,Man
Cornmeal...,Marshall
We'd love a cornmeal body scrub!,Lily
I can't believe you guys are closing.,Ted
I can't believe we're still open. Gotcha! These are getting bigger.,Man
It's like an entire country without a tailor.,Barney
"Yeah, give me two coffees.",Robin
"$3,50, please. Hey, what did you think of the game last night?",Women
What game?,Robin
The Leafs b*at Edmonton. Beauchemin went five hole in OT.,Women
"Oh, I guess I missed it.",Robin
"Oh, sorry. You're American. Here's your change.",Women
I'm not American.,Robin
American money? Didn't watch the Leafs game? No please or thank you for the coffee? You sure don't seem like a Canadian.,Women
What's wrong? Other than the fact that this five dollar bill they gave you is blue.,Barney
"Wow. I'm not American, and apparently, I'm not Canadian either.",Robin
And there's kids playing hockey on the back. It's like you want us to make fun of you.,Barney
I don't want this anymore.,Marshall
"Dude, don't look at it. That's a rookie mistake.",Ted
We shouldn't have left Lily.,Marshall
"Well, if you're so worried, why don't you give her a call?",Ted
"I have. I left her, like, 20 messages. I said, I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It's all Ted's fault!",Marshall
What exactly is Ted's fault?,Ted
"This! This whole thing! We were having a perfectly nice trip, and then you kidnapped me. You didn't even let me, put on underwear!",Marshall
"We never used to put on underwear! That was the fun of a bro's trip to Gazzola's! We left everything, and everyone behind. It was just you and me! But now it's like you've disappeared into Lily.",Ted
That is not true.,Marshall
"It is true. You're not upset because you're worried she's mad. You're upset because you'd rather be with her, eating muffins than here with me, eating this delicious... I think one of my mushrooms just crawled away.",Ted
"Well, you know what? That mushroom's not the only thing that's living. Car keys, please.",Marshall
"Look at this money! This one has a moose, this one has a beaver, and they all have Elton John on the back.",Barney
"When I moved to the States, I swore to myself, I wasn't going to change. And yet, here I am, in the most Canadian place in the universe- Tim Horton's- around the corner from the Hockey Hall of Fame, and I don't belong. It's like I don't have a country.",Robin
"Okay, that's it. ",Barney
"Sparky was my best friend, but after I married Helen, old Spark started to feel a little left out. For so long, it had been just me and him, but now he suddenly felt like Helen had taken his place. What Sparky didn't realize was, even though I loved Helen, I still loved him, too. I had room in my heart for both of them. But maybe I should have put aside some special ball-tossing time just for the two of us t o make sure Sparky knew that he was a good boy. I wish now I had, 'cause old Sparky ran out in front of a Cadillac and got splattered like a watermelon in one of them Gallagher shows.",Kenny
"I'm sorry, ted!",Marshall
"I'm sorry! No, I'm sorry. I never should have been mad at you!",Ted
"No, I never should have brought lily. She pees all the time, even at the apartment. Still bros?",Marshall
"Best bros. Hey, you want to crank some Van Halen just like old times?",Ted
"Hells, yeah!",Marshall
Or listen to the Sparky book again?,Ted
Listen to the Sparky book again.,Marshall
Okay. Let's listen to it again.,Ted
"Man, those Canadian doctors banded me up, reset my jaw, put my shoulder back in its socket, and they didn't even bill me. Idiots. All right, I guess they're no idiots. The coffee was extraordinary. Huh. I guess Canada's not so bad. They play their cards right, maybe they can even become a state someday.",Barney
"Barney, I've thought about this. When you stood up and told off those people, I thought, Yeah, America's cool.",Robin
Hmm.,Barney
"And then when those guys pounded the stuffing out of you, I thought, Yeah, Canada's pretty cool, too. I may have taken a few pokes myself. So, I've decided, dual citizenship. I'm going to be American and Canadian.",Robin
"Wait, you can do that?",Barney
"Yeah, dummy. Instead of being a woman with no country, I'm going to be a woman with two.",Robin
I see.,Barney
You understand?,Robin
"No, I can see out of my left eye again.",Barney
"Hey, baby? Baby?",Marshall
Hmm? Yeah?,Lily
I'm so sorry that we left you.,Marshall
"Did you go somewhere, sweetie?",Lily
"Mmm... Oh, oh, oh... Yeah...",Lily
"So, I had a great time, too.",Lily
That's good. And I'm so sorry you didn't get any pizza.,Marshall
"Oh, that's okay.",Lily
"God, my stomach! Damn you, Gazzola's!",Marshall
It's like a hot ball of lead!,Ted
"Baby, cut it out of me.",Marshall
"That was a wild trip, huh, Ted?",Marshall
I know. It was kind of crazy. But how great is it to drink some Tantrum again?,Ted
"You know who had fun, was Lily. Lily drank like, four cans of the stuff. Right Lil'? Where's Lily?",Marshall
This is nonsense. They are still playing the bagpipes.,Robin
I know. It's been 6 hours. That must be the fact that Stan Tantric bagpipes.,Ted
"It does not stop him from screaming to play louder, but it seems that there is rather strong. I have a glass of water in my room that vibrates like Jurassic Park.",Robin
Are there neighbors! Stop the bagpipes!,Ted
I hate to be the one to tell you. Marshall and Lily get divorced.,Barney
Not at all.,Ted
Look what I saw yesterday.,Barney
"Baby, you can wash it?",Lily
No problem.,Marshall
I gotta go.,Barney
"She makes her dishes right away, Ted. I give them two or three weeks maximum.",Barney
There is nothing serious. And certainly nothing serious enough that you hold my hand.,Ted
They have a big problem.,Barney
"I see what happens. You, my friend, you suffer from a disease little known... little known because I just invented it... called Adequacy of New Relationship. Robin, you are in your honeymoon stage. Everything is perfect. The songs on the radio talking about you. Other couples are concerned. Enjoy it. The SNR does not last forever.",Ted
"If, when you're great like me. Listen to this. Robin taking into account the number of beds in which we did. One is 83 and a half.",Barney
And a half?,Ted
An Ottoman 19th in an antique shop.,Barney
What's new?,Marshall
Big Tiger. You holding up? Want a hug? You mean yesterday? You're safe here.,Barney
"According to Barney, Lily asking you to do your own dishes right away is a sign that your marriage falls apart.",Ted
"Why? Lily loves a clean sink so I do the dishes right away, what's the problem?",Marshall
I'll tell you what's the problem. You know how I was always the best single? Now I'm the best in relationship. Even better than you and Lily.,Barney
"Look at you. You got a girlfriend for 5 minutes and you think playing in the big leagues. Adorable. Son... I'm in a relationship for your ponytail and that you were playing the guitar with Dave Matthews Mom. I am a good boyfriend when I sleep. I can do a k*ll foot massage, hand and prepare a great chamomile on the other, which would make you cry. Damn, I know more about how to make popcorn and watch movies with Sandra Bullock in that you'll ever know, but thank you to worry, blue.",Marshall
Let me ask you a question.,Barney
Go ahead.,Marshall
"Do you mind you, if the sink is full of dirty dishes?",Barney
Not really.,Marshall
"So what is the problem of Lily, not yours.",Barney
"But if I said that, we will play, so...",Marshall
"You argue. Robin, we do not fight.",Barney
Of course I do.,Ted
"No. And here's the secret, every time we say we're going to argue...",Barney
Why is there a bag of pants marked April 2008 in your closet?,Robin
So when you think you will play and you get up you go?,Ted
It works in 100% of cases. No fighting if you're not there.This is what Gandhi said.,Barney
This is not true.,Ted
I can not believe Robin supports it.,Marshall
Do not worry. It also has a good way to avoid arguments.,Barney
The ties go to the machine?,Robin
You're leaving. Robin begins to coat. I never heard anything so stupid.,Marshall
"Well, the thing naked is not bad. It was weird.",Ted
Call me crazy.,Marshall
Mad.,Ted
"But when you have a problem with Lily, it is discussed.",Marshall
"There's so much to do with the mouth. Why spoil it by talking? But if you insist, here's what I would say on the dishes if I was married to Lily.",Barney
"Barney, you came home!",Lily
Go to the basics!,Marshall
Okay.,Barney
"Thank you, doll.",Barney
"Honey, you're going to wash it?",Lily
"I'm glad you mention it. No. And that's why. I know you do not like dirty sinks. But do it for me to clean it? If one day I looked up the ceiling of the room and think, Hey, I want a replica of the Sistine Chapel is what you will paint the?",Barney
No. Of course not.,Lily
"Exactly! Similarly, if you do not like having lots of dirty dishes, it's your washing.",Barney
Thank you explained that. I get confused easily.,Lily
It's because you're a woman.,Barney
I do not even know why we laugh!,Lily
Of course not.,Barney
Are you kidding me.,Ted
"Wait, Ted. Listen to the man.",Marshall
"Once I have his attention, it's time to get out the heavy a*tillery.",Barney
"Look, I love you. But, baby, with little energy I have left after work, I want to cover you with love, not washing dishes.",Barney
You're right. I'll do the dishes. Just after doing this.,Lily
"Now, turn around.",Barney
You b*at him or I do it?,Ted
He's right.,Marshall
"No. Marshall, look at me. Do not go into the circus of Barney Stinson, the house of mirrors and illogical logic. You got ear pierced like that in 2003.",Ted
The piercing was cool.,Barney
"It was cool, huh?",Marshall
Stay with me! Barney is wrong.,Ted
"No, not at all. I hate doing the dishes right away.",Marshall
You just said the opposite!,Ted
I hate it! I hate it from the depths of my soul! I hate it! I hate it I hate it!,Marshall
You're welcome.,Barney
Okay. There you are. You're gonna tell me the truth. Barney said that you did ever played.,Ted
I think that's true.,Robin
I told you.,Barney
Impossible. I love you both but you're the two biggest emotional disabilities in the history of relations. You had to play at least once.,Ted
"You know what? It's true. We tried to find out which of us was most great. But it said draw and we made love. Speaking of that, I am delighted that we go skiing this weekend. I need a break. The upstairs neighbors make me crazy.",Robin
"Yeah, it's ugly. I'll go talk to them.",Ted
Thank you.,Robin
"Super. Here are your tasks for the weekend. Ted, you're gonna go see the neighbors. Marshall, you go see Lily. Robin and I need you for a crouched position on an animal skin in our chalet. Ready? Break!",Barney
Have fun.,Ted
"Barney... With his madness, his theory goes well thought might work.",Marshall
I will repeat once. This is a bad idea.,Ted
Will it work.,Marshall
A second time. This is a bad idea.,Ted
"Barney argued logically. Lily is a reasonable woman. I think if I explain, understand and can go in my opinion.",Marshall
No. She will be angry and you will play.,Ted
It is a slap bet?,Marshall
We bet a slap.,Ted
"Baby, you can do the dishes?",Lily
"Lily, I am delighted that you mention.",Marshall
I can stay here tonight?,Marshall
"I am preparing the couch, man.",Ted
The ski babes are back!,Robin
How was the trip?,Ted
Okay.,Barney
"We spent the weekend hugging the fireside. No black diamonds, nothing but red hearts. I'll unpack my bags.",Robin
What has happened between you? When did you become disgusting?,Ted
"It's not great to finally see blossomed emotionally, spiritually and sexually?",Barney
We all came out a year.,Ted
"short, and your weekend?",Barney
Terrible. And because of you! I listened to your advice stupid!,Marshall
"Baby, you can do the dishes?",Lily
"Lily, I am delighted that you mention. No. And that's why... It's like, okay? You want me to get up and I wash my dishes. But maybe... I want you... combs the ceiling, right? I can say, Yes. I will do my dishes, if you get up and you painted the ceiling of naked babies.  You see? It's just...",Marshall
"I do not know what happened. I am a lawyer. I earn my living by arguing but when it is with Lily, I'm... confused. How not to be with her eyes and her breasts?",Marshall
What happened to the I'm tired after my exhausting day and I want to use what little energy I have left to cover you with love?,Barney
I should have noted.,Marshall
I'm making more money than you.,Marshall
Excuse me?,Lily
Dance for me.,Marshall
"It's so much better when you said but with me, it turned into an argument. And when we started arguing, it starts to mutate and multiply.",Marshall
It started with the dishes but after...,Marshall
So you're saying you should not do the dishes because you work harder than me.,Lily
"It's not what I say... but it's true. And suddenly, we argue as to who works the hardest.",Marshall
I teach kindergarten. I shape the leaders of tomorrow.,Lily
You eat cookies and you glue stuff. And other disputes are parties. Until there is so much we can no longer follow.,Marshall
"If you need to go there at night, or you turn on the light or toilet you sit.",Lily
My mother does not hate you. It is neutral about you.I'm not afraid of your imitation of Shining. I just did not need to hear it mostly at night.,Marshall
"Danny is not here, Mrs. Torrance.",Lily
"Do not do that, please.",Marshall
"Dude, Lily is played badly. It is small... but as a vicious badger that your brother would have caught and starved for 5 days and placed in your sleeping bag. I should go and apologize.",Marshall
"You need to be angry. Dispute yourself stronger.Imagine that Marshall never have to wash dishes in all your life, all the plates are clean. Why, it would relieve any anxiety to any meal. Not having to tie your T-shirt to form a bowl of salted fortune for your pleasures. This world belongs to you, Marshall.Beach house, take it, put yourself in holiday clothes, benefits.",Barney
He's right.,Marshall
Barney's stupid ideas you have put into this mess. There is no escaping it. Make this stupid dishwasher.,Ted
This dish is my manhood! And I want to leave my manhood deep in the dirty sink full of ketchup and pasta...,Marshall
What do you eat?,Barney
"Well shit, it's my right! I will wipe my manhood when I'm ready!",Marshall
"Where is he was not riding? Hey, Barnstormer.",Robin
"Hey, Ro-Ro.",Barney
You're cute nicknames? Seriously. What happens to you both?,Ted
Nothing. We're just happy.,Robin
"As Gandhi said, A smile costs nothing, baby.",Barney
I'm not sure that you know who Gandhi is.,Ted
So you talked to the neighbors?,Robin
"Yeah, yeah, I did. I went up ready to put them back.",Ted
Some old?,Robin
Really old.,Ted
So you did what?,Robin
"I did not have the strength to tell them to stop, because, good for them. So I told them you want to welcome, ate a hard caramel, acquiesced to some r*cist comments and I left.",Ted
"I do not care if the dishes are not done. If you do not give a damn, do it.",Marshall
"Super. So I do not care if you have an orgasm. If you do not give a damn, do it yourself.",Lily
I spent 18 years without a woman does not affect me. I can do it again.,Marshall
You will perhaps have to do it again.,Lily
"I do not know what to do. We never had to fight so long. It's as if I no longer existed. Sunday morning, she made a pancake, Ted. A pancake and a slice of bacon.",Marshall
It's your fault. You took advice in love with Barney.,Ted
"Well, maybe Barney was all inclusive. He and Ro-Ro are the best pair now. With Lily it was dethroned.",Marshall
"You know, I do not believe all this stuff cute and adorable, it's not them. And I know for a fact that Robin hates nicknames.",Ted
"Thank you, Robbie Engineering.",Ted
I do not like nicknames.,Robin
"You're finished with the sports page, Sherbs?",Ted
"Seriously, stop.",Robin
It's T-Mose.,Ted
I do not like with you either.,Robin
"Apparently, she loves them now. And... come on, someone had to stop T-Mose.",Marshall
T-Mose was great. I think of the show.,Ted
The bagpipe seems different today. There was an echo.,Marshall
They're probably playing the bagpipes on the shower chair.,Ted
How will Marshall and Lily?,Barney
"Those two worry me, really.",Robin
"You and your big, huge heart.",Barney
Enough. The game is over.,Ted
What do you mean by that?,Barney
"Who, him?",Robin
"It's going to come. You see, I knew it was wrong. You two were too happy, too radiant, too surnomants. It was not right.Never disputes? Crap. You argue all... the... time.",Ted
How would you know that?,Robin
Phil told me.,Ted
Who the hell is Phil?,Barney
Your downstairs neighbor.,Ted
I'm Phil. 12-B.,Man
And it has everything... heard. So Phil told me that Ro-Ro and Barnstormer argue... a lot. Explanations?,Ted
All was going well. Our techniques dodges worked perfectly until the skiing trip last weekend.,Barney
I found at Marshall's arguments Lily were zero then it will never have to wash another dish. Slap me in two.,Barney
It's your board that is zero.,Robin
You're on the side of Lily? You...  No. We will argue and I can not spin.,Barney
I can not undress. It's freezing here. I'll be hypothermic.,Robin
Or so I tried the jump?,Barney
Or just the pants?,Robin
This trick of dodging is over?,Barney
I think.,Robin
You have the? This is the smallest!,Barney
They fight because of you!?,Robin
And it does not stop there. We argue non-stop since.,Barney
All the disputes that had prevented us are above benefits.The bag of panties.,Robin
The tie m*rder by Robin.,Barney
The hidden camera in the headboard.,Robin
"As a quarterback to stay on top. Monday morning, he sits on an ice pack and are studying the tape of the match.",Barney
Barney for the millionth time...,Robin
I knew it! I knew you were too cute and perfect!,Ted
"Look, we were fed up everyone to tell us how we are no relations.",Barney
It was nice to be the ideal couple for one minute.,Robin
I knew you were lying. Get up early for the feint-T Mose.,Ted
Stop it.,Robin
"Marshall, dinner is ready.",Lily
You've done for me?,Marshall
"No, but what is your favorite.",Lily
We need advice.,Barney
I'll do the dishes directly to my death.,Marshall
"I do not care when you take out. But if it is made of cheese as a good ziti, do soak.",Lily
"Sure, honey.",Marshall
I love you.,Lily
I love you too.,Marshall
"You see? At the moment, how did you do to fix everything?",Robin
I do not know. Sometimes you just let his ego aside.,Marshall
And keep in mind that the love you have for that other person is more important than winning.,Lily
More important than winning.,Barney
"Calm. Calm down. Seriously, what's the secret?",Robin
"The honeymoon phase may be over, but now you can get down to business. And honestly, it's the best part.",Lily
Good night.,Robin
What about now?,Barney
I think we should talk about advantage and get down to business.,Robin
"Or, there is a bench in the elevator.",Barney
"That's better. It is not the best couple in the world, so what?",Robin
Grave. It's not a competition.,Barney
We won!,Lily
Best couple of the world!,Marshall
Guess what? These glasses are plastic. So you can throw them. So no dirty dishes in the sink.,Marshall
You're dirty. It is you who should be in the sink.,Lily
"Your girlfriend? This is your girlfriend!? It is small and it's your friend? Do not humanize the enemy. But, delighted.",Barney
Come on. Open it. It's p*rn collection! Just kidding. It would be weird.,Barney
It's your p*rn collection.,Ted
"This is my collection of p*rn! I offer you my p*rn. Now that it goes really well with Robin, I need more.",Barney
"Voluntarily, you abandon your p*rn...? You're really serious.",Lily
This is obvious.,Marshall
What does that mean?,Barney
"Nothing, it's just, you know, you have love handles.",Marshall
What?! I have no love handles. This is ridiculous.,Barney
"It's nothing. Once you're with someone, it is natural to let some go. Trust me. It's been there.",Marshall
He really is growing at a time.,Lily
"We gotta go. Goodbye, my dear friends. You were always there for me. We will miss you.",Barney
He speaks to p*rn.,Robin
"Hi, Robin. A more.",Ted
Hi.,Robin
"My God, matte videos. The orgy of space? The surprise party of 23 students naughty?",Lily
"You'd think after 22 celebrations, students would no longer surprises.",Marshall
You can get rid of it.,Lily
"No, it's not a problem. I'll do it.",Ted
Are you sure? It's nothing. We can go around back and throw the box in the trash.,Lily
I read six of the words you just said about this jacket.,Marshall
"Seriously, this is nothing. I'm on it.",Ted
Because...,Lily
"Let them! In a sense, it's sad, right? Barney who abandons his p*rn. He has love handles. They eat the same thing every night. We are witnessing the end of Barney Stinson as we know it.",Ted
So what? They are happy.,Marshall
Let's go. A more.,Lily
So you're what?,Marshall
I Tail-Dalle.,Lily
What...? I thought I had seen in one take.,Marshall
Yeah. It's called Tail-Dalle.,Lily
ArchiSexTure. That's not how you write Buckminster Fuller.,Ted
I get rid of this horrible pornography on the field.,Ted
ArchiSexture.,Voice
"If you watch this tape, and I knew it... is that you are in possession of all my p*rn. It can only mean two things, either I'm dead or I'm in a committed relationship. If I died, I want you honor my memory by taking my body in the Hamptons and recreating Weekend at Bernie. I want to dance. I want to make love. And I want to go fishing. If, on the other hand, I'm in a relationship, as best friend, I have one favor to ask. Please, for God's sake, get me out of here!",Barney
"I can look happy, but do not believe it. Barney Stinson is suited for celibacy.  Out of pity, if our best friends account... And yes, Marshall, I'm his best friend, how you take it? So, get me out of here. And finally, since you hoping to see some p*rn...  Do not worry. The green light means it is off.",Barney
We're sure he had done?,Lily
"There is no reason to take it seriously, though?",Ted
"No, of course. This is an old tape. Barney is pleased with Robin.",Lily
So what you did last night?,Lily
"I wanted to go to a concert. Him at a party. We could obviously do what the other wanted, so we stayed to watch a movie on cable.",Robin
It was Legen... wait... the Autumn. Legends of the Fall!It was fun.,Barney
"I spotted this girl there, and I will need help to land the plane.",Ted
"Sorry, I have my own way tonight.",Barney
How do you go?,Lily
Super. Relations are deadly...,Barney
Shut up...,Robin
Exchanges and compromise...,Barney
Shut up...,Robin
Monogamy is the best.,Barney
Shut up.,Robin
Tagline!,Barney
Shut up.,Robin
More hungry...,Barney
I can... in a minute.,Barney
They k*ll.,Ted
They love each other.,Lily
"Barney and Robin are in love, but they are more Barney and Robin. They are big and old.",Ted
My favorite cop show.,Marshall
This is obvious. Barney eats too much because he hates to lose his freedom. Robin and stress because she hates what has become Barney.,Ted
They are perfect together.,Lily
It might be the problem. They are too similar. It's hard to have two dominant in a relationship.,Ted
We are two dominant sets.,Marshall
"Of course, my heart.",Lily
"If they are not happy, why not break?",Marshall
They are too stubborn. Neither wants to be the first to admit he no longer wants. They play at first that deflates.,Ted
I think the first who plays Barney deflates.,Marshall
It's a bad time. It takes time to get used to each other. They are... How do you say selfish nicely?,Lily
Independents. Every relationship goes through there.,Lily
"It's true... I had a friend astronaut, totally in love with his fiancee. On the eve of her mission, she surprised him with four other girls and two guys. It has become intense. She ended up sneaking into the space shuttle...",Marshall
Talk about Space Orgy?,Ted
Yeah.,Marshall
It's a bad time. Let us do things.,Lily
She's right.,Marshall
"Two against one, Ted. Let them.",Lily
"Did you notice that the beef ribs were absolutely disgusting, but recently they have become delicious?",Barney
"I'll get to the point, and ask you a question. Are you happy with Robin?",Marshall
Are you kidding?! How could I not be? It's Robin!,Barney
So you're happy?,Marshall
"Can you ask me this question. We argue constantly, but you know what they say about relationships, Every moment is a battle.",Barney
So you're happy?,Marshall
And you know what happens right after a fight? Gender reconciliation. What is different... when you're in a loving and lasting relationship.,Barney
"Stack we make love, we order a pizza face and it stays there to moan.",Barney
Okay. Decides that the piece.,Robin
What was the pizza again?,Barney
Face.,Robin
It's face.,Barney
"Sex... I'm right? Fortunately, it is becoming rare. I'm still hungry. You're hungry?",Barney
We must break them. You're right. Barney and Robin are unhappy together but they are too stubborn to admit it. We must make the break.,Marshall
What next?,Ted
We will release... the Kraken.,Marshall
Forget. I took my retirement. I no longer.,Lily
But you're the best.,Marshall
"I swear, I gave up these shots there. I became legit. I am now matchmaker.",Lily
Find me someone.,Ted
I just started.,Lily
Please. You've got to break. This relationship is k*ll them.,Marshall
"I know, but I learned the lesson. I no longer interferes. I let things.",Lily
It's two against one.,Ted
But the one that's me.,Lily
No need for it. We can do it alone.,Ted
How?,Marshall
"When I was with Robin, you remember the only thing that made pinball?",Ted
You do not have the right to do this to me.,Robin
What are you talking?,Ted
From this! That's what I mean. How does it feel in my champagne?,Robin
"If Robin thinks for one second that Barney wants to marry her, she Petera a lead and they will break.",Ted
"That sucks. Why not let Barney be tempted by a sexy girl?  Okay, going to the ring.",Marshall
A surveillance van.,Marshall
What?,Ted
"It should take one. We have ordered pizza, watched through binoculars and said, That's not why I signed, or stuff like that.",Marshall
The server arrives.,Ted
"Please, shut up.",Robin
What?,Barney
"I thought you had mentioned, sorry.  This is an engagement ring?Are you...?",Robin
"No, this is not one. They had the wrong table. You can imagine we are married?",Barney
We're committed to one another.,Robin
Your business is already in my apartment.,Barney
Easier for taxes.,Robin
And for your naturalization.,Barney
Scherbatsky is hard to spell.,Robin
My mother would be so happy.,Barney
"Yeah, I guess.",Robin
No reason not to do so.,Barney
We get married!,Barney
"Not so loud, shit.",Robin
What did you do? I'm furious now. It will not?,Lily
You will be my bridesmaid?,Robin
"Oh, my God! I'd love to!",Lily
"You have lost your mind? You knew they were playing that first deflates, and what? You give them an engagement ring!Okay, that's good. I care. I return to the center stage for a final rupture.",Lily
What next?,Marshall
"They are up to their necks. A single argument will not suffice. We must revive the four largest arguments they've ever had, at one time. Number one, the battle of dirty dishes. Number two, the conflict of ex-girlfriends.",Lily
You do not know any that girl over there?,Robin
"No, I do not think.  No, actually, I do not know... This is Meg. I do not compare in my mind there. Can you pick me?",Barney
Really?,Robin
"Number three, the altercation Star Wars.",Lily
You're not a bit old for that stupid doll?,Robin
It's not a doll. It's a stormtrooper.,Barney
He wears a diaper.,Robin
"No, it's protective armor.",Barney
A stormtrooper? Rather a storm-merdeur.,Robin
Come on.,Barney
It looks like your storm-merdeur the changes we need.,Robin
"You know, I'm sick.",Barney
I said nothing.,Robin
"The jokes about magic, the stormtrooper...",Barney
"And, of course, the biggest, the Canadian-American w*r.",Lily
"thank you God, the song is over. Who was the old devil who sang?",Barney
You know Neil Young is my favorite musician.,Robin
"She was the wife of Archie in All in the family, or the same voice?",Barney
Neil Young is a Canadian treasure. Do not make fun of Neil Young.,Robin
I never make fun of an old lady paralyzed vocal cord...,Barney
I've found. I have found. They maile images reminding those fights.,Ted
"Poor kid. This is how it will happen. They are the restau...  First, it rekindles debate US-Canada, when Alan Thicke, a native of Ontario, going to their table.",Lily
Alan Thicke?,Ted
Oh yes. Robin was known when she sang.,Marshall
"They are always in contact. I had his number on the mobile Robin. Seriously... amateurs.  So, Alan Thicke stimulus battle USA / Canada. Just then, Meg-the-crazy happens. Then, a stormtrooper happening in the street.And just when they are tired, a diver passes with a basin full of what? Dirty dishes.",Lily
This is your masterpiece.,Ted
It takes a surveillance van!,Marshall
A Break? Really? You have rented a station wagon?,Marshall
A van costs $ 25 more.,Ted
A Break?,Marshall
"Greeting, Will Robinson! That a birthday?",Robot
Get in the car.,Lily
What is that thing?,Ted
They did not stormtrooper so I had to take another robot. It will work also.,Lily
Another robot? The stormtroopers are not robots.,Ted
Of course they are robots! Must k*ll Luke Skywalker,Lily
No one said this in Star Wars.,Ted
Very bad robot voice.,Marshall
Someone ordered an extra large sausage?,Man
A film of Barney begins like that.,Ted
Barney Five... order something.,Marshall
I do not know if everything will be back.,Man
Now you mention the movie.,Ted
It continues. The server supports a second sheet.,Marshall
We need it here. It is in hiding.,Lily
You dont need a van?,Man
A van is more expensive.,Ted
Thank you!,Marshall
"Pass me a slice, Will Robinson!",Robot
"If you work the costume, they will pay us.",Ted
Stop and think only of money.,Marshall
Give a hand to the stormtrooper.,Lily
Thank you!,Marshall
$ 25!,Ted
"No, go up. Wait... When they blew the Death Star with thousands of stormtroopers it was human?",Lily
It was the Death Star. They did not sign in the wind.,Marshall
Someone should take this sausage!,Man
You were in this video? The guy with the tan of a farmer?,Ted
"Many want pizza, Will Robinson!",Robot
That's not why I signed.,Man
"You know what? Everyone, stop! Alan thicke, close it!Marshall is a break. Put-in-t. Ted, stop talking about p*rn. And for God's sake, give the pizza stormtrooper!",Lily
Damn! They see us.,Lily
You're sure they've seen us?,Marshall
I can go talk to Barney? I'm too excited. You really think he'll ask me to marry?,Woman
"Forget it is located. If you try something, they'll know it's us. We should all go...",Marshall
This is my masterpiece. And then they saw us? It will work anyway.,Lily
Come on. We find something else.,Ted
"I repeat, I'm Alan Thicke.",Alan
You are Alan Thicke?,Woman
"Alan Thicke, to you. Go ahead.",Lily
They kiss? They should not! Why it does not work?,Lily
Because they love.,Ted
It was a bad spot.,Marshall
What am I doing? All this was a mistake.,Lily
So... it tells you to smoke joints?,Robot
"I thought that I would not say that this coir, but... Robin and Barney, the happy couple.",Ted
Where is Barney?,Lily
It was broken.,Robin
Look at us. It is horrible all the time like that?,Robin
"I'm not happy. Finally, I would be. Nothing would make me happier than to be happy, but... I'm not.",Barney
"What are we doing wrong? We love. If it does not work, what then? We are so similar.",Robin
We love scotch. It is awesome.,Barney
That might be it. There may be too great there.,Robin
"Exactly. Two awesome cancel out, and... I'm tired of being canceled.",Barney
Me too. We separate?,Robin
I think. Shit. Following happens. After which you and I can not become friends again.,Barney
It's maybe not a break. This is perhaps... two friends... who find themselves.,Robin
Good news! I forgive you for that restraining order.,Meg-the-crazy
It's a stormtrooper?,Robin
It's not a stormtr... We're going from here?,Barney
"In addition, Alan.",Robin
You still live at 73rd Street?,Meg-the-insane
How do you know?,Alan
Friends that are found. I like it.,Barney
One for the Road?,Robin
"And then who knows? Maybe in 40 years, if you have not found anyone...",Barney
I am already involved with Ted.,Robin
"It's true. Thin. Maybe in 39 years, if you have not found anyone...",Barney
"So, how is Barney?",Marshall
"Well, I think. It may take a while to recover, but... You had a thrill?",Robin
Dad returned.,Barney
Content that is either mentioned it again.,Alan
It is getting it soon.,Robin
I love that you are always so many friends after this clip.,Lily
Clip? The video for Sandcastles! It was also this together.,Alan
What do you mean too?,Barney
We had this issue of Canadian variety that missed. It was so shameful. Imagine what would happen if someone put their hands on it?,Alan
You then.,Robin
You see that guy over there in diving suit? You think you're going to go talk to him?,Lily
No.,Woman
Okay. This is certainly the biggest con on this planet.,Lily
How do you know?,Woman
This is one of my best friends.,Lily
And the diving suit?,Woman
"It's a long story. You see, he just break...",Lily
"My career. This is my new priority. From now on, more a date. The job.",Robin
"All women of New York. That's right, Barney Stinson is back on the market. Mother, lock your daughters. Daughters, lock your MAQACENJaR.",Barney
MAQACENJaR?,Marshall
"Wait, I can find. With Mothers Who I'd like Sunset And Never Forgot.",Ted
You have the right answer!,Barney
"You're not rush a little, then?",Lily
"Since I went out with Robin there is a trick that I have not used as much as I wanted. It is... rather large, surprisingly heavy, with the skin, and it's black. My friends, this is the book of... Roles.",Barney
"The Roles book contains all the scams, trickery, deception, underhand, cunning, nonsense, and embobinages tricks I used, or expected use, to nab the girls and do their business.",Barney
You're writing another book? Stephen King was one right there.,Marshall
"It's all there. Everything, starting from the basic, like Le Bois Do Not Ca...",Barney
Do not drink it. I saw a guy put something.,Barney
What? Who?,Woman
This guy.,Barney
Thank you.,Woman
"... Until more advanced maneuvers, such as the Ms. Stinsfire.",Barney
"Kappas, after our disciplinary hearing on obscene behavior last semester, we welcome a new housekeeper. I present to you Ms. Stinsfire.",Women
I do not see how it could not walk.,Marshall
What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?,Ted
"Glad you asked. The Lorenzon Von Matterhorn will be my comeback on stage. Or, you know, in my bed. In fact, my bed is on a stage. I put it on a platform and installed lighting. A real production. Barney goes!",Barney
And you Robin? You leave it in play? Where is your book of Roles?,Marshall
"My book? Buddy... in two volumes, right here.",Robin
A great book.,Ted
"Yeah, I'm reading it.",Lily
"So, I have told you, I take a break on that side.",Robin
It's going to happen.,Ted
Bluntly.,Marshall
What?,Robin
You'll fall in love.,Ted
Very soon.,Marshall
"It's unlikely, I focus on my career, finished the rencards.",Robin
We play Pyramid. What people are saying just before meeting the love.,Ted
"Kelly Harris, a fellow law school, said... The law school is too hard, I want to focus on courses. Six months later?Married!",Marshall
It's good but...,Robin
"Travis Frenchroy, replacing bartender told me... I'm done with all these rencards. I want to concentrate on my fan fiction of Star Trek. Six months later... Married!",Ted
I answer? It's good for them...,Robin
"Matthew Blitz, accounting job, said... I will die alone.To focus as much on taxes this year. Six months later? PACS and plans to marry pending the enactment of the Act currently in the Senate from New York!",Marshall
"It happens, whatever you say. It is a law of nature.",Ted
Judged. By nature.,Marshall
Trust me. I would not get interested in relationships. I would not be single if I wanted to be single.,Ted
Okay. Are you ready?,Lily
Ready for what?,Ted
"Three years ago, Shelly started working at my school.When I saw her, I said, It's perfect for Ted.",Lily
Why do not you talk to me now?,Ted
I usually hate rencards arranged but Ted looks great.,Shelly
He is. It is so great and attentive and intelligent.,Lily
Another chicken and stick to you the crown!,Marshall
"I do not see it. It must be voluntary. So, another bar?",Lily
Yeah she was pretty.,Ted
It still is. And you're ready.,Lily
But you can put three times more than chicken fingers in your mouth. You know.,Marshall
I will fix it but promise me not to do anything stupid.,Lily
I promise to do anything stupid.,Ted
"I know. I'm sorry, I am ashamed.",Shelly
You should!,Lily
This is the case!,Shelly
You should! You should!,Lily
"This is the case, it does! This is false. I could not wait to meet Ted but I arrived at the bar an hour early and I met this great guy. Kind, serious genius.",Shelly
And you met him at McLaren's?,Lily
Just at the bar.,Shelly
What is the name there?,Lily
I should not say. And shit. This is Lorenzo Von Matterhorn!,Shelly
You... dirty bastard.,Lily
"So, he got Shelly? It must have upset you.",Woman
Bluntly.,Lily
I had put aside for Ted Shelly for 3 years.,Lily
"My hen, Ted did not miss much. She is brainy, boring, a bit boring in bed. In fact it would have been perfect for Ted.Oops!  If I had known she was there for Ted, I would have obviously not done, but... given the circumstances, I think Ted would be proud of me. I managed The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.",Barney
What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?,Woman
"Exactly, yes.",Lily
What The Lorenzo Von Matterhorn?,Lily
Glad you asked.,Barney
"To achieve the Lorenzo Von Matterhorn is what you need, basic knowledge in web design and a truly unique fake name. So think about your fake name right away. You? Fine.Now choose your target.  Preferably a girl with a great big... phone.  Yeah that's me.",Barney
I know you?,Shelly
I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn.,Barney
"You are, kind known?",Shelly
"Yes. You do not know who I am, does not it? It feels good for once. Nice to meet you...",Barney
Shelly.,Shelly
"Shelly? Again, I'm Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. It is written as it is pronounced, with two T.  Then, once you leave, she takes out her phone and tries Lorenzo Von Matterhorn on the Internet. And that's when she discovers... A series of fake websites, all devoted to the incredible life of Lorenzo Von Matterhorn. A false item of business on Lorenzo, the hermit billionaire. The fake of the Explorer Club newsletter on his trip to the North Pole in an airship, a feat of imagination and challenge. The fake medical journal with a story to make you cry the doctors saying that a reduction of the penis is not an option. And time to return...  I hate to be cheeky, but I can offer you a coffee?",Barney
Yes! Please.,Shelly
"How much is a coffee today, $ 50? And here we go.",Barney
It's horrible. You realize you've broken her heart? She is inconsolable.,Lily
Why would it be inconsolable? The airship of Lorenzo will not disappear in the Arctic for a week. Sorry if this is that someone told her that it was lies.,Barney
It was all lies?,Shelly
It was all lies.,Lily
The expedition in the airship?,Shelly
Lies!,Lily
The artificial island in the shape of his face off Dubai?,Shelly
Lies!,Lily
Finishing third in the contest of Laser Tag?,Shelly
"Men... Actually, that's true. I went there.",Lily
You went to the Vatican?,Shelly
Lies!,Lily
"Oh my God! Well, I hope you are pleased with you.",Barney
What?,Lily
Thou hast broken my heart.,Barney
Me?,Lily
"You! She will never trust a man. You've spoiled for Ted.Not to mention Julio Von Matterhorn, the twin brother of Lorenzo.",Barney
"Do you believe? He says it's my fault. And by the way, Ted, I bet she go out with you again.",Lily
I'm thinking. Do I want to date a girl that Barney was typed?Help me for harmonies. Of course.,Ted
That must bother you a bit.,Lily
It's his life. These girls had it coming if they are stupid enough to be fooled.,Robin
I agree. You've seen one called The Sn&amp;aring;sa?,Marshall
You're an astronaut?,Woman
"Actually, I'm in a top secret government space program called Secret NASA... Sn&amp;aring;sa.",Barney
Sn&amp;aring;sa? You went to the moon and everything?,Woman
"No Moon you know, but I went on Slune.",Barney
The Slune.,Woman
"If you fall in there, you break my heart, but sorry, you're sd√©bile.",Robin
"So, then?",Woman
"Well, Barney, you go out... You just get out of a sincere relationship. You're a big boy now. You can return to your towers to two euros.",Lily
Tours to two euros?! None of these towers is. The Tower A except two Euros.,Barney
"I am the bassist for Tower Two Euros. And even that involves expensive hair extensions. Now, if you allow, I have to prepare for the event tonight. The I ex√©cuterais he will not come.Glad you asked.",Barney
"The To run it will not come, you will need the observation deck of the Empire State Building. Got it? Fine. For generations, this is the place chosen by New Yorkers for reunion with their lost lovers of view, you need to go to every girl and say, He will not come.",Barney
What are you talking about?,Woman
Let it go.  He will not come. He will not come. She's not coming? Sorry.  Until... He will not come.,Barney
No? But we agreed. We always said we would meet again here. Tonight it. I'm an idiot.,Woman
I'll fetch the newspaper.,Robin
"Or rather, look for a husband.",Ted
Grave.,Marshall
"You must stop, seriously. The last thing I'm looking for now is a relationship.",Robin
"Taking the newspaper, think to watch the ads for marriages.For yours.",Ted
It's like that. Have you any idea how many times in my life when I went to look for frozen waffles frozen in vain?,Marshall
Thousands?,Robin
"Millions. But when I go in search of a mirror or the remote because Lily and I had an argument and she has hidden there, whereupon I fall? Frozen waffles. It's like that. You go out to get the newspaper, but you come back with frozen waffles.And there, frozen waffles he's a guy. As long as you're there, you take it back frozen waffles? And there, frozen waffles are... frozen waffles.",Marshall
What happened?,Robin
"I tried the he will not come, and it worked. Monstrous.You should have seen this girl.",Barney
I'm leaving.,Robin
"So, we came up to me, and I go to my room to prepare the camera... lighting candles... and when I go out, nobody, paper and more roles! We all know who is responsible for that.",Barney
"Yes, we know.",Lily
Al-Qaeda.,Barney
"No, you idiot. That was me.",Lily
You... enfoir√©e dirty!,Barney
"You have stolen the Book of Roles? So, the daughter of the Empire State Building?",Woman
An actress friend.,Lily
An actress. Of course. That explains his perfect diction and style of Drag.,Barney
I'm almost to the point of taking this book and put it on the net for everyone to see.,Lily
You would not dare.,Barney
"No, as you stop scams and confidence tricks, deception, underhand, tricks, schemes and embobinages.",Lily
You did not say nonsense.,Barney
No more nonsense!,Lily
Slim.,Barney
Sorry to interrupt but check it out.,Robin
No.,Ted
I was abandoned at the altar.,Barney
"Oh, my god, it's horrible. I wonder if it works.",Ted
And yet this is not the worst. Do you saw My Penis grants wishes?,Marshall
Really? A genie comes out?,Woman
Only if you rub hard enough.,Barney
And what happens after it?,Woman
He starts singing and objects come alive and dance with him.,Ted
It's not very well designed. This is not Ms. Stinsfire.,Marshall
And in real life?,Woman
A few hours later...,Lily
"Apparently, it will rain.",Ted
"If you wonder, I would be at McLaren's playing a character from the Book of roles being called The Diver. That's all.",Barney
"It's good. I put the Book of Roles on the Internet. Baby, you can put the Book of Roles on the Internet?",Lily
"Sure baby, but there is something odd. I flipped through the whole book. There is no role called The Diver.",Marshall
"Now you want to know what the diver. In fact, it was on the last page of the Book, but I pulled in case. But do not worry.You will see it in action. You see the blonde next to the bar?Cizzible rep√©rizz√©e.",Barney
"Barney, no. You are...",Lily
"Forget it, kid. If anyone should be angry with me, this is Robin. She loves the book.",Barney
I did not worship the book.,Robin
"But what...? The Book of the Rolls, this is gold. Granted this is truly spectacular.",Barney
"We just broke. The costumes are nice, but... it just broke.",Robin
"I did not know you felt it. I was so caught up with my own projects as... Damn, she looks out there. Quickly dispersed.",Barney
It's good. You see that guy over there in diving suit?,Lily
And here we are.,Lily
Wait. Why he wears a wetsuit?,Woman
"I have no idea. And it's k*ll us, Claire. It k*ll us!",Marshall
Let's ask him.,Claire
"So what does the diver? Claire and here, in passing.",Lily
"Hello, Claire. I am Lieutenant Frank Lyman. I train dolphins b*mb detectors for... You know what? I can not do that.Robin, I'm sorry. I think this break is harder for me than expected.The Book of roles was just a way to change my mind.",Barney
It's okay. It's hard for me too. Look at me. I gave up on relationships.,Robin
She is getting married.,Marshall
I will prepare my toast.,Ted
I have to check my tuxedo.,Marshall
I'll knock your heads like two coconuts.,Robin
"I'm delighted that you stop it. And frankly, the real Barney is better than all the false Barney's Book of Roles.",Lily
"Is it true? Claire, you must have heard a lot about the real Barney tonight. Want some coffee?",Barney
"Before refusing, you should know that in this neoprene combined with what appears to be a pair of socks...",Lily
"A Pringles, but still.",Barney
... is an incredible kind. He's funny and it's one of my best friends. And he came out with this g*n.,Lily
It's a good guy.,Robin
"Come on, go out with him.",Ted
"It's a coffee, huh?",Marshall
It's nothing.,Robin
"Okay, okay. Going for coffee.",Claire
I'm proud of him. It takes a lot of Pringles to be as vulnerable.,Marshall
I had a message from Barney. Look under the table.  A page from the Book of Roles.,Lily
It says what?,Robin
It's The Diver.,Ted
"Step one, talk to a friend Book Roles. Step two, play with one of his colleagues and make angry she steals the Book.Step three, put the combi and say you will do a final round, The Diver with the sexy girl next to the bar. Your friend, let's call her Lily, told him everything about the book. Now the hard part.When Lily and daughter are questioning The Diver, remove the mask, and pull out the stops on your deepest insecurities that do not exist because you are awesome. Sad for you, Lily talks about you to the girl who agrees to have coffee. And... is... gone.",Barney
You dirty bastard...!,Lily
"It is. You say you do not want a relationship. Well, the love of your life will not pass this door, and this is... this kind.",Marshall
I will not fall in love with him.,Robin
"Yes, because it is... this kind.",Ted
"No comment. The blue jacket, it does not suit me, so...",Robin
"Right, because here it is. It is this type!  Let him at least a chance. Get out a bit with it, see if it can give something.",Marshall
I will work.,Robin
"Yeah, right.",Marshall
I'm really going to work.,Robin
"You, Robin?",Man
Yes.,Robin
"Don, new co-host.",Man
"Damn, Marshall.",Robin
"It's beautiful. She is 10 pounds. It is organic. Do you remember my uncle Heinrek bald? Looks like his head squarely. Oh, my God! My my turkey... turkey!",Marshall
We brought the turkey.,Robin
You have brought back an old turkey replacement.Why I have not listened to the message of former mayor Ed Koch saying not to forget my business.,Marshall
"With Robin we went to the objects found in the prefecture and there, sitting in their fridge... Is this your turkey?",Ted
"Yes! It's my turkey! Come here, my beautiful little enfoir√©e!",Marshall
I'll go put it in the oven.,Lily
You're the best friends in the world!,Marshall
It was a team effort.,Barney
"I do not know what to say. It's Thanksgiving, but thank you does not seem enough.",Marshall
You have done the same for us.,Ted
"Yes, and you know why? Because I love you. And I'll show you how. Ted Mosby and Robin Scherbatsky, I bring you... the fourth slap.",Marshall
Wait. What?,Barney
You're saying...,Ted
What you think you say?,Robin
"Certainly not. Unless you were thinking... Baffegiving two: Revenge of the lower in this case, yes, that's what I'm saying!",Marshall
The slaps are not transferable.,Barney
Lily is the curator of the bet.,Marshall
The slaps are transferable.,Lily
You realize that you will remain one. Are you sure you want to spend a day.,Robin
"Life is short. I tell myself, Baffe Diem. A rule, the slap must be given before sunset to avoid interference dinner Lily.",Marshall
And how!,Lily
"Two, you must decide which of you will. Three, we will attach to the chair Barney, now be called The Throne of Baffe. It fits you?",Marshall
Awesome.,Lily
Absolutely not!,Barney
We expect someone else?,Lily
Dad?,Lily
"Yes, sweetie, but look! I just finished my new board game hit, The Merchant of Sleep in Tijuana.",Mickey
"Yes but it's good! Car Battery. How long can you hold?Hey, Princess. Take that.",Mickey
"Well, just play the new game from Dad, There is a demon clown under the bed.",Mickey
"Rita, you are anxious... to move to Florida?",Marshall
"Well, my dear, slight change of plan. We stay here for now.",Rita
"The straw of my mini-juice broke! Man, hurry! What a nice surprise.",Voice
What has happened with your apartment?,Lily
I had a little problem with my roommate.,Mickey
What has happened?,Lily
He wanted me to pay rent. It has ended badly.,Mickey
You should pay rent to live in the basement of your parents.,Lily
It's not my first choice. With the old schnoques up there it's a little disturbing. They do not understand the trick of the sock on the handle.,Mickey
They surprised you with a girl?,Marshall
In a sense.,Mickey
Working? You are retired.,Lily
Now that I have another mouth to feed I had to return to the mill. Where is my truss?,Grandfather
You not only prevented them from moving to Florida but you obliged to rework grandfather?,Lily
"Just the time to share my games with my Aldrin limitless SENSAS last game ', Fighting dogs.",Mickey
I brought The Disease!,Mickey
What is he doing here?,Lily
I do not know but we should bring him in and discover.,Marshall
I want to see him! Returns it!,Lily
"Stay there, okay? We will solve the problem.",Marshall
"Take your time, amigo. All is well as I Of Diseases!Having fun is contagious.",Mickey
I hope Lily is well.,Robin
"Me too. She speaks little, but that thing with his father gave him much trouble.",Ted
Tell me which of you is going to slap me!,Barney
What?,Ted
"I die, I, here. Ted takes a chip, I jump! Robin arranges her hair, I jump! I jump all the time. It's bad for my skin. It gives me wrinkles. Wrinkles!",Barney
"Lily, go. It's been 3 years. This is long enough.",Marshall
The equity in my life brings me nothing but stress. It's easier that he is dead to me.,Lily
"I've supported when our neighbor, Mr. Sias, died in your sight.",Marshall
This is our journal.,Lily
You will have it in 15 minutes. 20 or more. I ate a steak last night.,Neighbor
"And when Whitney, your maid of honor, had died in your sight.",Marshall
You're worth it!,Robin
The color is gorgeous!,Female
"Thank you, girls.",Lily
I'm not a fan of strapless.,Whitney
I even understood when Mr. Park to the grocery store downstairs was dead in your eyes.,Marshall
"A coffee, please. But only if it is decaf. I want to sleep tonight.",Lily
$ 1.50.,Grocer
Coffee normal.,Man
$ 1.50.,Grocer
I'm sorry. Are you sure mine is decaf? You used the same coffee.,Lily
I lied to him to him. Okay?,Grocer
OK ... You dirty bastard!  It was not decaf!,Lily
"I've supported with these unknowns, but it's your father, okay? We can at least give him some turkey?",Marshall
No.,Lily
"Go. Please, I can not ask him to leave at Thanksgiving.",Marshall
"You did not ask. Tell him it's just important that it is here. In less than two, it will be a games convention in Toledo, to give money to your dental apparatus in a so-called Milton Bradley.",Lily
He was trying to earn money to feed his family.,Marshall
"No, that's what mom was doing with his two jobs. This man broke my heart every day for 20 years.",Lily
So we can give pieces of chicken not cooked.,Marshall
"Seriously Robin, you should have the slap. You're a big baffeuse. In fact, I want to study the slaps in your tutoring. I wanna be your apprentice-slap.",Ted
Do not underestimate. You're a rock star of slaps. Your name should be Eric Baffe-PTON.,Robin
This is torture. Put me in the chair...,Barney
The Throne of Baffe.,Ted
And finish it!,Barney
It's all yours.,Robin
"No. To you, I insist.",Ted
"Okay, I will.",Robin
"Great. Wait, what?",Ted
I say I'll slap.,Robin
"What, so it's... the end of the discussion?",Ted
You said I could slap.,Robin
"I was polite. If someone will slap, it will be me.",Ted
"No, not at all.",Robin
This is interesting.,Barney
It's your family. And I'm sorry but we do not separate the family.,Marshall
"It's easy for you to say that, you come to the family the most ridiculously close to the world.",Lily
It is not ridiculously close.,Marshall
Really? And the Eriksen family dinner every Sunday?,Lily
"Everything looks delicious, mom Eriksen.",Father
"Thank you, daddy bear. Marshall, will you say grace?",Mother
I'm sorry but it's weird.,Lily
A family must be close like that. And I want our future family is. And that includes your father.,Marshall
"I can not believe you take her part. Let me be clear. This man will never set foot in this house, ever!",Lily
It will take about 5 minutes.,Marshall
It's a disease?,Marshall
No.,Mickey
"We have one hour before sunset, and none of us baffera Barney.",Robin
Let me do it. It was my idea to call the objects found in the prefecture.,Ted
It's a good point. Rebuttal?,Barney
I slipped a note of the type 20!,Robin
philosophical riddle. Idea against execution. Itemize your arguments.,Barney
I brought this large turkey so far.,Ted
I paid the taxi.,Robin
You've slept with one of my best friends!,Ted
What? You said it was fine.,Robin
"Well, no!",Ted
Why did not you say anything?,Robin
Because I love you always!,Ted
You really want to slap Barney the point of lying and pretending to be in love with me?,Robin
I really want to slap!,Ted
"Your father has made mistakes in the past, but it has changed. He moved out of your grandparents. He has a job. He pays his taxes.",Marshall
"Wait, how you know all this?",Lily
"Gender, body language. Okay, we had a drink last week.",Marshall
I miss her so much. My little princess. She talks about me?,Mickey
"Yeah, kind, all the time. She tells this story all the time...",Marshall
Never?,Mickey
"No, not a word. But that does not have to be like that.We can fix that, right?",Marshall
"I always thought it would arrange the marriage. I even wrote a speech. But hey, not invited '. Thin, I have not even seen the wedding photo.",Mickey
"And right before my eyes, your father broke down in tears.  Stop it! You come to Thanksgiving!",Marshall
You've invited?!,Lily
"The poor man was sobbing. What could I do? A fool and called him a girl, what I found unjustified.",Marshall
I do not believe you. What gives you the right to do that?,Lily
You and I are married. So it is also part of my family. Enter.,Marshall
"Ted, you should play quickly. Your gallbladder is about to explode.",Mickey
It must be half an hour. We should get Lily.,Marshall
You have to let it calm down. Finish the game.,Mickey
Repeat-a. The first seven!,Barney
Robin Shit! I knew Barney first. This is for me to slap.,Ted
"This slap is mine, Mosby. I never slap Barney... above the belt.",Robin
I want to slap Barney since I met him!,Ted
And I would not slap?,Robin
"One second. This slap was supposed to be a wonderful thing, a gift, and it has turned against each other.",Ted
"My God, you're right. This fruit has changed in immaculate slap-poisoned apple. You know what? Seriously, do it.",Robin
Are you sure?,Ted
Baffe-solument.,Robin
We should really get Lily.,Marshall
"Ted, gall bladder about to fart.",Mickey
"It's decided. Barney, go. Come on the throne.",Ted
You're gonna...,Barney
Yep. Go.,Ted
"I guess this is the best choice, Robin. Finally... the men are stronger than women.",Barney
Do not listen. It's decided.,Ted
"And that's what you always wanted, is not it? A strong man to take care of you? Of course, teenager, you were a feisty, playing hockey with the boys, you skinned your knees on the ice. But what you could say to your teammates... or even to yourself... that is all you really wanted was this pretty white dress in this beautiful white chapel. And at the end of the aisle strewn with pretty white flowers, a man to take care of all your slaps.",Barney
Leads to me!,Robin
Robin! Pull yourself together!  What just happened?,Ted
"Sorry, Ted. expl*si*n of the gallbladder. You stand back 3 spaces.",Mickey
You come here and you watch your daughter go without care. And now you destroy the Thanksgiving dinner! Lily is on it since this morning!,Marshall
Relax. This is not true of bile. It is of Chinese painting to lead. And bile horse.,Mickey
What is it? It does what?,Mickey
You have swallowed this painting?,Ted
This is my look you're dead to me.,Marshall
"Yeah, Lily does it better...",Mickey
Get out of my house!,Marshall
"In Mr. Park... I was not expecting to find you here. Lily, I'm sorry. Just let me express myself. I thought the family was right but it's wrong. It is a privilege, and it deserves it. I put your father out. And I promise you, baby, I do... you never force her to see him again.  What? Baby, what has happened?",Marshall
"Marshall, I came here because I was cold and it was the only place that was open. I would not even look at Mr. Park in the eye. And then I discovered that... Mr. Park's death. He really died for me. And if I feel so bad to have never forgiven Mr. Park, a guy who literally did not mean anything to me? We have to get my father.",Lily
"Commissioner of the bet-Baffe, tie me to the chair is a violation...",Barney
"Less talking shop, more slaps.",Lily
You just 2 minutes. You decided which of you will be entitled to a slap in the face to Barney?,Marshall
It's gonna be Ted.,Robin
What? Why me?,Ted
"Last year you were abandoned at the altar. You lost your job. You did so along way. I am so proud of you, Ted. You deserve to slap someone in the face as hard as you can.",Robin
Thank you.,Ted
This is the worst.,Barney
"You just go through a break... and even though I know that you and Barney are remained on good terms, there is not a part of you, well hidden that wants to slap in the face?",Ted
Yes,Robin
I know.,Ted
It's downright hell.,Barney
Okay.,Ted
It hurts!,Barney
"I can not do it. I can not take that away from you, Ted.",Robin
I do not either.,Ted
thank you God.,Barney
"So, I want to move. Mickey?",Robin
No way!,Barney
"I'm glad you and Lily try to fix things. You want to welcome into our family, I would like to offer you the slap.",Robin
"Really? It's a bit weird for me, I just met Barney and I have nothing against him but how many times have we a chance to slap someone in the face?",Mickey
Gently!,Barney
I'm sorry. I can not do it.,Mickey
thank you God.,Barney
I know I have not been a good father.,Mickey
You're kidding me.,Barney
"So for all dance recitals that I missed, for all the art exhibitions that I should attend... for the wedding that I was not able to offer you... I give you, to you This slap.",Mickey
"No. No, no, no, no. It is the Commissioner of the bet-Baffe. It must remain impartial!",Barney
The Commissioner of the bet-Baffe says it's good.,Lily
It's not good. Please... Let me...,Barney
Close your eyes. It will soon be over.,Lily
I'm running in a meadow.,Barney
I can not do it. Why I can not do it?,Lily
Because... the slap did exactly what I hoped. It brought us together. And it forced us to recognize the weakness and at the same time the greatness in ourselves and in others.,Marshall
Stop your bullshit.,Barney
And so... there will not slap... of... today.,Marshall
This is the best Thanksgiving...,Barney
4! So the turkey?,Marshall
"A new home Aldrin Games, is... The Bet-Baffe! The game of happy slaps which is a box.  You got slap. Right in the face, my friend... For children of all ages. You got slap. It really happened... Everyone saw! Everyone laughed and applauded because it was great...",Voices

"Well, I received another.",Marshall
What's there in the box? What there was in the boiiite?What there was in the boiiiiiite?! What there was in the boiiiiiiite?! Not bad eh? Nothing. I'm the idiot huh? What there was in the box?,Robin
"Since Lily and Marshall have their apartment, her mother keeps sending him old things she wants to get rid.",Ted
"Well done 'man, right on target this time. I really needed the right arm of Himan, and this old book of Mad Libs.Pet went to fart to fart loud. This is good. Thank you 'man.",Marshall
Hello?,Ted

"Lily, the window is open. Fight your way, watercourse Ted, run!",Ted
Ted?,Woman

"Yes, of course.",Maggie
"Come on, tell me that happened to you on time?",Marshall

What's happening? What is this window?,Robin
"You see how everyone knows a person, and whatever happens, this person is perfect for you.",Ted
My cats.,Robin
Lily.,Marshall
That girl over there.,Barney
Well this girl was and still is Maggie Wilks.,Ted
"We went to college together, she's great. Everybody liked him.",Marshall
Oh I know what we do here. Tell me when it stops.,Barney
It was not the fact that Maggie was good. It was the...,Ted
It was the perfect girl next door.,Marshall
"It was the perfect girl next door. And still is. All the guys who meet Maggie fall madly in love with her. And that's the problem. Since I know her, she has been single for only three short windows of time.",Ted
"When she moved here and broke up with her boyfriend in college, I waited one month, not to go for the spare wheel. And the spare wheel well, he stayed two years. After their breakup, I have waited a week. Late again. She stayed with guys for 3 years.",Ted
"The third time, I was super fast. I got not even one hour after their breakup. The only thing she has made between the break and I arrived, it's down to her mail.",Ted
"Late again. And she went out with him four years. I would not let me have it again. So I begged her neighbor, Ms. Doglas, call me when she and David have broken loose.",Ted
"And now, a single and Maggie is available along the way to this bar right now. I made him take a taxi with a woman driver for there is no interaction with a man, so far.",Ted
"Even when I arrived here, she still will not touch with a man. I feel good tonight, this evening will be well.",Barney
"This is my overalls. I wore this little baby, during high school.",Marshall
"Hey, you were really a virgin before he met Lily.",Robin
It was not necessary.,Marshall
"She's right baby, if you had worn it in college, even I would not have slept with you. And if you remember, I wanted to.",Lily
"No way, no one could sleep while wearing it. Challenge accepted. I, Barney Stinson, brilliant mind in an extraordinary body, this will overalls, and lie with a woman.",Barney
I went out with this guy.,Robin
"Ok, game plan Maggie arrives, a few minutes of gathering and presentation, and everyone leaves us. This is my only chance, and I will not go wrong.",Ted
You do not give a lecture tonight?,Robin
Damn!,Ted
"Oh my God, good evening.",Lily
"I want you to Maggie Robin, my roommate.",Ted
Nice to meet you.,Maggie
Likewise.,Robin
"I completely forgot, I teach a class tonight. How would you like to come and see what happens during an architecture?",Ted

I've already spent on the cable.,Don
You're already past the cable?,Robin
"It was the best weekend of my life. When you do the newspaper, you're sitting on ergonomic seats, you feel like sitting on a cloud, which was good also because it was just after my colonoscopy. And the locker room, wow.",Don
There are changing rooms?,Mike
"Oh yes there was the break, Mike. We will not change in the toilets of KFC on the other side of the street. Oh no. It was heaven. But once you get used to, they will not care at the door to find someone who is not undergoing divorce, or who is not addicted to gin. And before you know it, you find yourself in a dead end, surrounded by people who are going nowhere in their careers, making these programs in their underwear.",Don
"ok, the trick underwear was your choice. And I would not keep that going.",Robin
You are beautiful guys. It's comfortable eh?,Don
"I want to k*ll him, of course people watching this show.You look at her. My God, you still have not seen the program.",Robin

The day the mentor MC mailly eliminated each year, and of course... wait, because God knows it's true: fear of pregnancy.",Barney
And why you smoke there?,Ted
I'm always on the verge of sleep Ted.,Barney
"Maybe that smoking is not so bad, at least it is outdoors.",Lily
And my abs muscle nicotine. I... am... muscular.,Barney

It's too stressful!,Barney
Just one.,Marshall

Ok we'll do it now!,Ted
"Oh my little princess porcelain, why would you do that?",Don
"Why? Because it is important to Don, the issue is important and my career. Not like you, you incompetent. You're boring, you are bad, and I want you to work at least as hard as the elastic of your underwear.",Robin
I begin to believe that it becomes personal.,Don
"No gift, it would become personal if I told you that just because you pass emission issue, it's because you're losing. A loser lazy and obnoxious.",Robin
The mayor canceled.,Don

What are you doing?,Robin
I like my cigarette. Oh that's good. Want a latte?,Don
You can be professional?,Robin
"Yes professional, you know who holds the camera? A chair, even the cameraman is not looking our show and that's why the mayor has canceled. And Mike went to fast food, and that you and I can enjoy a cigarette here.",Don
No thank you.,Robin
"Why? Because there are millions of viewers? If viewers are problems with this, call us at the number on the screen: 212-555-0192. Go robin, appreciate life a little.  It must be Mike, he always forgets to take them into extra-crunchy.",Don

"Ladies and gentlemen, the McLaren's hired a sexy barmaid.",Barney
Look at all these guys. The sidewalk will feel the pee now.,Lily
We'd better find a new bar.,Robin
"What... are you crazy? It's a sexy barmaid. Do you know how long I've waited for me... My friends, I slept with many women in my glory days. Lawyers, professors, poets, doctors, professional riders, and animators... A butcher, a baker, a candle maker. Yes, we got to the part where it rhymes. A teacher, a restorative, an observer... A puppeteer, a croupier, a housewife, it is also a job, guys. A circuit court judge...",Barney
Abbreviates!,Robin
"I never, never slept with a barmaid sexy, until tonight.",Barney
It's not so sexy.,Robin
Would you jealous of the attention? Imagined would be the sexiest girl in the bar?,Ted

"Guess who will not fall under his spell? I will make him Do not try, baby. Papa needs a gin and tonic. And when she will, I recracherai saying Do it again.  The dominant male where it should be: on top, and after a few minutes below. Why should I do anything?",Barney
"Guys, what's up?",Marshall
A new super sexy barmaid.,Lily
You see? Marshall does not think she's sexy.,Robin
If he thinks. Do not bother to pretend that other women are not attractive just for my own good.,Lily
"I know, and if this woman was almost as sexy as mine, so I admit, but it is not the case.",Marshall
"Baby, you're an angel, but compared to this woman, I am a big trash bag 3 days.",Lily
"I say what I see, and... I think until you're the most beautiful woman in the world.",Marshall
"You see, it's really annoying.",Lily

The second sexiest.,Robin
I repeat...,Marshall
"Baby, how can you not want you to do? I want to do it. If you do not wanna do it, sorry, but you must be gay.",Lily
"Yeah, I'm gay. Gay for you.",Marshall
No matter. You understand why I'm the only guy she does not know this bar?,Barney
Yes... You will not like the answer.,Marshall
My last three were former Wall Street brokers.Bastards. I swore never to go out with a guy who wears suits.,Barmaid
It's easy. I just have to stop wearing costumes.,Barney
"Is that all? Come on, you're always in costume.",Robin
"True... But for these two... And, for that... Finally, for her... I'll stop wearing, wait...",Barney
We know you're gonna say costumes.,Robin
Another weird thing on my roommate: she paints robots who play sports.,Cindy
It's strange.,Ted
And she has this weird habit of blackmailing his breakf.,Cindy
It's weird.,Ted
"Look, I am defeated. I hate it.",Ted
Sorry. It is not so bad. I'm just a little jealous.,Cindy
I do not know why. You're great.,Ted
"Sorry to have misjudged you. If there is a kind of men I can not stand are those in costume. Ca, and a woman who does not comply.",Barmaid
The costumes and complexed. I hate them. I hate them.,Barney
"So, your date with Cindy?",Robin
"Well, last night, it was nice today, less.",Ted
Why?,Lily

It's not like if you followed my progress. It is not even in the same department.,Ted
"Sorry, but I can not take that risk.",Cindy
"She exaggerates, there, right?",Ted
"Well, Ted, she's right.",Robin
"And thoughtful. If the rules are so strict, you could put your work in.",Lily
"I think you should leave it, buddy.",Marshall
"Okay, I start again. She exaggerates, there, right?",Ted
Sorry for my delay. I was stuck at work. I had this presentation on taxes on dividends.,Marshall
"Of course, I listened carefully when you spoke.",Lily
"So, I started the Powerpoint...  Barney?",Marshall
We will order food.,Marshall
I arrive in a second.,Barney
"Sorry, Barney. There is nothing more to do.",Tim
So young. You can not do anything else?,Barney
No. But we can use the buttons on this costume to another.,Tim
It can... As an organ donor?,Barney
The death of this suit could save the life of another.,Tim
But I... Do it.,Barney
You do what it takes. Do not cry about it. It's silk.,Tim
Sorry. I know. I know.,Barney
We have the remains cremated. Its buttons have saved a sick jacket of the Upper East Side.,Barney
"Finally, you can abandon the quest for so-called sexy barmaid.",Robin
"No. My costume gave his life for this cause, and I do not should rest before these two... Well, it... Finally,... Be it mine.",Barney
There is absolutely right.,Ted
"Who, the guy who kisses an urn full of ashes costume. This guy?",Lily
"What if Cindy is the woman I am to marry, and I give up?Farewell, elegant but cozy house in Westchester, with a reasonable loan that I can pay without ruining me. Goodbye, the two children raised in a strict but loving hand, finding the perfect balance between the father and friend. Adios, triplets Schnauzers, Frank Lloyd Wright and. The fact is, I do not give up either!  I do not know why I did that.",Ted
"Barney, sorry about your friend. Tell me about him.",Barmaid
"It was Italian. Classic, elegant. And my God he knew how to deal with women. They could not say no.",Barney
How old was he?,Barmaid
7 years. I miss him so much!,Barney
You should not be alone tonight. I will finish earlier.,Barmaid
"Thank you, old friend. You go on a good sh*t.",Barney
"Admit it, she is sexier than me. It will not hurt me.",Lily
I can not. You're sexier than she.,Marshall
"That's a goddess! Her skin glows. Her legs are super long.And that ass? I do not mind having it, even on the head! That night, I admit, I thought about it a little more than once.",Lily
"What do you...? Kind, you think she is sexier than me?",Marshall
I never said that.,Lily
You think so!,Marshall
It's not comparable. She is younger than you.,Lily
"I'm just, like, me, my friend, against it, its old.",Marshall
"You two, the fact that it is not real sexy! She is sexy thanks to circumstances! Look.",Robin
I guess you also think she is sexier than me.,Marshall
What are you doing?,Carl
What?,Robin
You do not have the right to be there.,Carl
"Carl, listening. No. I do not want to leave. Mercy, mercy, do not force me to leave.",Robin
You have to go. You have to go.,Carl
"I was someone there, behind! Everybody loved me.",Robin
Can we talk?,Ted
My roommate is going out of the shower. Come into my room.,Cindy
"I know the law prohibits us from going out together. But he also says Do not teach in having drunk and I do it all the time.The fact is... I really appreciate you. You're cute, funny. You write a thesis which is entitled, Foreign direct investment and intergenerational ties of consumption behavior. It's too sexy! I know it sounds crazy, but... I feel that our paths are supposed to meet, and... I do not want to miss meeting you.",Ted
"I do not want it, me either.",Cindy
"I gotta tell you, just by looking at your room, I know we have much in common.",Ted
Really?,Cindy
The Unicorns? Who will cut our hair When We're Gone? I thought I was the only one with this album.,Ted
This is my roommate. I borrowed.,Cindy
And that? After World T.C Boyle?,Ted
Birthday present... my roommate. I did not read it yet.,Cindy
"You should. It is really good. And that? It is the height. You play the bass? Seriously, ask my friends. I have always said that my perfect woman... does not play bass, because that is clearly that of your roommate.",Ted
It is in a group.,Cindy
"Damn, that's cool.",Ted
It's amazing. You chose the only three things that are here to my roommate.,Cindy
The group played shows your roommate or...?,Ted
Get out.,Cindy
"It was so special, you know? We should observe a minute of silence. Followed by about 20 minutes of grunting.",Barney
I'll help you feel much better. Let me refresh.,Barmaid
"Okay. Expected. No, this is not the bathroom. This is...",Barney
They are yours?,Barmaid
I'm the suit-sitting for someone.,Barney
"Barney, you lied to me. You must choose immediately.Me... or costumes.",Barmaid
Costumes!,Barney
"What would you say, against all your costume you were offered eternal youth?",Marshall
Costumes!,Barney
What would you choose: a million girls and one three parts?,Robin
Do we see.,Barney
And a world at peace would be within your reach?,Lily
"I'll stop. These are the costumes. Stops just bullshit.Two, three, four! Girls come and depart, but the clothes remain constant! Each buddy d√©pote and rambling, it is no substitute!Sorry, my costumes, I give you my life. My Sunday clothes are my best friends! The casual clothes go in the basket because nothing goes better with the undisputed often praised, claiming to fame... a true... Expect more... Costume...",Barney
"Mind you, it is rather barrel.  I choose you you, baby. Tomorrow morning, I get rid of these costumes.",Barney
Really?,Barmaid
Yeah.  I will do you nothing!,Barney
"You're not serious, my students are going to catch me so I do them a lesson. I have not even my slide projector.",Ted
"Ted, I'm champion of skee-ball, since law school. I have come here at least once a month to keep my record.",Marshall
"Looks like you're not income from a lease, a guy called Big caramel you're passed.",Ted
"Yes, yes.",Marshall
And you're Big caramel.,Ted
"The biggest. In fact, I must tell you something. I invited Jenkins.",Marshall
You will not believe what Jenkins has done this time.,Marshall
Who is Jenkins?,Ted
"This is a new lawyer in the office of Marshall, he is hilarious.",Lily
"Hilarious! There was a jar of cherries in the fridge, then Jenkins said: $ 200 and I eat the whole pot. So we gave him $ 200, and he ate the whole jar!",Marshall
"The CFO comes to sign papers, then Jenkins said: Excuse me Mr Wilkocs, I think we forgot one of the documents.We all went to a bar after work, Jenkins goes on the table and begins to gesticulate like a stripper, and a second later, he removes his shirt. It was so disgusting.",Marshall
"Well it feels good to finally meet the famous Jenkins, after all these stories.",Ted
What?!,Ted
You heard me.,Barney
You want to sleep with Jenkins?,Ted
"With Jenkins, of Jenkins, near Jenkins. You said it, I want to put like a sock.",Barney
But you are... really... I did not know that...,Ted
"Hi, guys.",Woman
Ted Jenkins here.,Marshall
"It's going to seem crazy, but I thought Jenkins was a guy.",Ted
What!? Where did you get it?,Marshall
"I do not know, maybe history: Jenkins pissed out the window of a taxi.",Ted
"Yes, even more impressive now, right?",Marshall
Yes.,Ted
"Ok, I confess! It all started a few weeks.",Marshall
"In fact the myopic! New lawyer, Jenkins here. Watch out for this guy, he steals things.",Man
I do not steal. And I do not wear glasses. Marshall.,Marshall
"Hi Marshall. So you're really a fan of the Vikings, or he lied about that too?",Jenkins
"Why? It's a trap, you're a fan of the Packers? My wife knows I'm here. She has no money, however it has very special k*ll.",Marshall
I'm a fan of the Vikings too! I think purple and gold. I am from Pelican Rapids.,Jenkins
"Pelican Rapids? My grandfather lives there. Finally he's dead now, but it haunts a bar on a road.",Marshall
"Wait, if you tell me that you flirt with a woman other than yours, I'll pull out and hit you.",Ted
"First, you can not control the Grand caramel. Secondly, I see it as a big brother, who has breasts. My older brother had also, in short.",Marshall
"That night, I spoke to Lily.",Marshall
I'm in a hurry to meet him.,Lily
"I should correct, it would have been so simple.",Marshall
"But I have not done. So now, whenever I talk about Jenkins, I avoid pronouns.",Marshall
"So the manager comes to marketing staff to choose Midwest. So he, he, he, she, him, him, Jenkins, him, her.",Marshall
"Look, I understand why you have not told him? You really think she would be jealous too.",Ted
"Ted, think of the stories I've told.",Marshall
"Yes, it could be a problem.",Ted
"Exactly, that's why Lily can know nothing.",Marshall
Lily can know nothing of what?,Robin
What Marshall is going to buy a horse.,Ted
"Really?! It's great, I love this stuff. Guys why this kid staring at me? I understand, I think it happens at last. I recognized my show.",Robin
"That's so cute. But it's Scotty, one of my students, and he looks at me me. Weird that I'm more famous than you.",Ted
"No, I go on TV.",Robin
"And I have 30 students in my class, which means, go, 30 times your hearing. We're going to buy Scotty a drink for old teacher. Scotty then, a question on neoclassical architecture, and it's good.",Ted
"You are Robin Scherbatsky, right?",Scotty
What?,Ted
Yes.,Robin
"I did not want to fix, it's just that I watch your show all the time.",Scotty
Really?,Robin
Really?,Ted
Bluntly. Why do you hang out with Ted?,Scotty
"Uh, this is Professor Mosby.",Ted
We're friends.,Robin
The cow! Robin Scherbatsky is friends with my art teacher.,Scotty
This is architecture. Go will study.,Ted
"And a second, you're Big caramel?",Scotty
Go!,Ted
Hello?,Marshall
"Hey baby, I go up there.",Lily
"What, why?",Marshall
"There was a problem at school, it was therefore the day. I thought to visit you, eat something with a nice little dessert.",Lily
"I have a problem, it was my wife. The first time I spoke to you, she thought you were a man, so...",Marshall
... then you're afraid she became insane upon learning that I am a woman.,Jenkins
Absolutely.,Marshall
"Good God, I was in a band improv. Am what I do.",Jenkins
"Hello, I'm Lily, Marshall's wife.",Lily
"Hi Lily, I am of the French Embassy. I am here because of a little problem with cheese but important.",Jenkins
It is Jenkins.,Marshall
You are Jenkins?,Lily
"Yes, well, uh, I'll let you sort it out between you, see you later.",Jenkins
"The famous Jenkins, gosh. I imagined a man, in short, we eat?",Lily
"Wait, you're not jealous at all?",Marshall
"Honey, I do not have to worry about you and another woman.",Lily
"Because we love to madness, right?",Marshall
Yes of course. Let's eat.,Lily
It was not jealous at all.,Marshall
"Of course she was not jealous, it is the dynamics of your relationship.",Ted
What is this supposed to mean?,Marshall
"That's how it goes boy, every relationship has a low and high.",Robin
"Exactly, low in trying to conquer another out of reach, and the strong will go back down to be with the other person less.",Ted
"I am not diminished for Lily. Yes, it is a bit small, and my mother says she has no hips to carry a baby Eriksen. My God, you think I'm weak.",Marshall
"That's why Lily is not jealous. The strongest is never jealous because where could go lower? The fort, Lily, is the best thing that low, Marshall may have hoped.",Robin
"No, ok, I'm glad Lily, but Lily is as lucky as me. None of us is low.",Marshall
"Yes, it's definitely, you are going to buy a horse.",Robin
What?,Marshall
Try your luck.,Robin
"So, to end modern architecture is very short, experimented with the houses in V.  Excuse me one second. What are you doing here?",Ted
"I've realized that you forgot something this morning, so I thought I would bring thee: thy pen.",Robin
"It's your pen, and you have chewed the end, recently.",Ted
"Nothing to Ted, your course was on my way to work.",Robin
"No, it is not.",Ted
"Come on, stand New York.",Robin
I watch your show all the time.,Student
"Really, you watch my show? You flatter me see. Other fans here?",Robin
"Thank you for last, Robin.",Ted
"That night, great show on poisons.  Also, who makes the worst pizza in New York, I will give you information on traffic streets 5 and 9.",Robin
"Really? You watch his show? It's like watching an aquarium lit, and less interesting. And now that I think, not even informed.",Ted
The truth is that we look for the drinking game.,Scotty
The what?,Ted
"As the show starts early, it is often at the bar. So when she did an interview, one should drink when she says But um.",Student
But huh?,Barney
"But um, it would seem, she often said.",Ted
"It's funny, I also had a drinking game based on Robin, Robin finally. At the bottom of her stomach...",Barney
It was agreed that you do not speak of those things.,Ted
"Sorry, you're right. She did not like anyway. She said it woke her up. Does she said But um so often?",Barney
"It's good but um, this was not your first spelling bee, does not it?",Robin
"No, the third.",Boy
Oh that's good. But hmm. But um...,Robin
Interesting article in the newspaper. They say that in every relationship there is a weak and strong.,Marshall
Let me see.,Lily
"It's not that one, it's in another, I've read before. The newspaper reminded me of the old. In short, what do you think?",Marshall
I think sometimes it's the case.,Lily
But not for us?,Marshall
"No, of course not.",Lily
"Sure. Imagine, you have a g*n to his head, you have to say that one of us is low.",Marshall
"I would say this is me, this is what is right.",Lily
"Now, the g*n is pointed at me, and our future children, and our future little monkeys. Depends on who wins the game is played for 3 years.",Marshall
"No, no weak or strong.",Lily
So this...,Marshall
"Our two children, our 8 grandchildren, 11 great grandchildren our, our plane piloted by Oprah, and it is poised to spits at an art museum that contains all your favorite pictures, and the only way save everything, and answered: Art thou the weak or strong?",Marshall
And Oprah has tried everything?,Lily
Everything you need to decide now.,Marshall
"I think if I had to really say, maybe I'm strong.",Lily
How can you say such a thing!,Marshall
"She thinks she is strong. That's right, I have to prove that I am not the weak. I will make her jealous.",Marshall
"Easy, that's the plan: A, layer with Jenkins. Two, I sleep with Jenkins first. Three, the second rule is the first I'm going to rule 2.",Barney
"Okay, I know. You remember the other night, the game of skee-ball, when you did your good score?",Ted
"Yes, an ordinary night for the Big caramel.",Marshall
Do you think she was flirting with me?,Marshall
Bluntly.,Ted
"Sure, I have an opening. If Madame Lily is jealous, young Marshall can not move, then by chance, the Big caramel... may move, ok let me try again.",Marshall
"Okay, I understand.",Ted
"Ted, I have a great idea.",Robin
Remove your hair in the bathtub once you're done? Looks like you want to make a bath mat.,Ted
"If you want to make one of your classes exciting, I could read it from someone a little more fun, your students can pay attention and learn.",Robin
"Oh, you're entertaining? Last night there were 3 minutes of silence where you tried to patch up your sweater.",Ted
"Look, just because your class prefers me to you...",Robin
... You're a drinking game.,Ted
What?,Robin
"That's why they watch. They did a drinking game on you.Every time you say But um, they take a sh*t.",Ted
But umm?,Robin
Yes.,Ted
"I'm not But um, I never told But hum.",Robin
"So I guess it's not a great drinking game. This means that last night when we played with Barney, I was not drunk and I did not vomit on it. Except that I did these two things here, take this.",Ted
Hey Jenkins!,Marshall
Hey buddy!,Jenkins
"So, Lily and I go back to university bar. And you wonder if maybe you would come... You could watch me play skee-ball... do exactly what you did the other night, something like that. It's really up to you, I mean...",Marshall
"Hey baby, what do you do at home?",Lily
"Baby! That is, it's a name I do not deserve.",Marshall
What?,Lily
"Oh, I see what happens. That's about all that history of strong and weak.",Lily
You're sure it's not a fever?,Marshall
You wanna make me jealous so you invent a story with Jenkins.,Lily
"I did not invent it! It happened, this woman kissed me.With language, his tongue was in my mouth.",Marshall
Of course it was.,Lily
It was silky... and hard as a branch of starfish,Marshall
"I'm so jealous, I'll go see it and hit right on the nose... like an old sandwich. Come on baby, you want some soup?",Lily
It happened! Have you... meatballs?,Marshall
And here's a few of his contributions to architecture and now... We remember him for just one thing. My friends this is the sad legacy of Gregorio... Franchetti Gazibo. Questions?,Ted
You want to come to the bar with us tonight?,Scotty
What?,Ted
"Yeah, we wanted to do some of Robin Scherbatsky, if you want to come?",Scotty
"Well, what can I say except... um But I am! I can always come? I will pay?",Ted
"So, your third book is your new novel, but um...",Robin
"Shit! Sorry. But, but just. No hum! Your first book was written more quickly?",Robin
"Oh, it's true!",Man
But umm...,Robin
But hum!,All
It's not pretty!,Ted
"I wanted to ask about the novel you're writing right now, but um...",Robin
But hum!,All
"And tonight, you had to, but um...",Robin
But hum!,All
"For a long time, but um...",Robin
But hum!,All
"No, no, no, do not drink, it's a trap!",Ted
"I think I should go, keep your $ 10!",Man
"Ok, um... but thank you for coming but um... If there are students who look, but um, but um, but um...",Robin
"We should drink professor, is the rule! She said but um.",Scotty
"My God, help us all!",Ted
Oh you're here! I'm really sorry to have embraced yesterday.,Jenkins
It's nothing.,Marshall
And I'm sorry I slept with you in the mail room.,Jenkins
It was not me!,Marshall
"Oh my God, that's embarrassing 2 discussions today. I do not do usually, I was totally stuffed.",Jenkins
You were drunk at 8am?,Marshall
"Yeah, I know not what has happened!",Jenkins
The police officer was unharmed but um...,Robin
But hum!  I gotta work!,Jenkins
Happy to have you helped you remember.,Marshall
"Damn, how I could do that!",Jenkins
It's nothing!,Marshall
"No, you know what it is not nothing. You are the coolest guy in the office that stupid. And I really do not want to spoil our friendship. This is so embarrassing, do not tell anyone please.",Jenkins
"No, who am I to say? Lily? I said to Lily.",Marshall
"For heaven's sake, I have to go talk to him, I must apologize!",Jenkins
"No, no!",Marshall
"If Marshall, I must say that it happened, it meant nothing... And I'm sorry.",Jenkins
"No, I... Yes! Yes! Do it!",Marshall
I'm going.,Jenkins
"And if you got no time for all this, just tell him that it happened and that you're sorry. And if you're really in a hurry did not tell him you're sorry. Just as it happened, what is most important. It really happened. Thus abbreviated it as much as you can.",Marshall
"So Lily, what I'm saying is that... It happened and I feel terrible. And I am truly sorry.",Jenkins
"Well, it happened! What will we do? It happened!Terrible, like you said. It happened!",Marshall
"Exactly, I feel bad and I hate myself. If what I have done you got injured or affected your relationship with Marshall, forgive me!",Jenkins
Kissed my husband! MY HUSBAND! Nobody embraces the father of my future children besides me.,Lily
"Marshall, you're in the field!",Barney
Lil '? It's good!,Marshall
So we'll just have a quiet day course. Nobody is talking! No noise!,Ted
How's you all?,Robin
"No, no, no, please. Just goes away!",Ted
I just wanted to tell you go...  To all those watching. Go! Standing New York! BUT HUM!,Robin
"You'll have a few minutes, Mr. Stinson.",Woman
"Hi friends, any sport has had its icon, which it excels. Ali was boxing, basketball had Jordan, and the sport of sleeping with b*mb snuff chance, my next guest, Mr Barney Stinson.Barney, welcome.",Jim
"Thank you, Jim. I'm glad to be back on the show.",Barney
"It's good to have you. And you know, the statistics, they really speak for themselves. Over 200 women spread over 6 continents, 17 countries, 74 sexual positions, and not a single bead. Impressive. But even with all these successes, there has always been an escape for you. Which brings us back to last week. Tell us about our history.",Jim
"Hold on, Jimbo, it is extraordinary.",Barney
It all started when I decided to start a small challenge.,Barney
Oh my God. Wow.,Marshall
He decides his v*ctim.,Ted
Whatever the girl I'm trying to point is that I go with her tonight. And... they're off!,Barney
Hi!,Marshall
Hi!,Robin
How did it go with Dale?,Lily
"You know, sometimes, the guy with thick glasses and a t-shirt of the Smurfs, it's just a cliche. And sometimes it is a moron with a squint and a platonic relationship with Gargamel.",Robin
"Robin, this is not because a guy talks a lot about a fictional character for your first date it can not be your future.",Lily
The Yeti is not fictitious.,Marshall
"So, the first night was pretty normal.",Jim
"Jim, there is nothing in my usual way to pack.",Barney
Respect. Which brings us to the second night.,Jim
"That brings us to the second night. You see the b*mb that pampers its Black Russian ? She left to exchange it with a White American. Enter me five! You know... If you're not careful, you'll lose me.",Barney
"Guys, when Dale called for a second hot date, what do I tell her?",Robin
How do you know he'll call?,Marshall
"How cute, Marshall. But I think mom knows when she was a hit. I mean, he could not help but look at me.",Robin
"And well, do not push too. People can be fragile. And sometimes, without even trying, you can tear someone's heart, and crush it in front of a roomful of 26 people and a teacher's assistant.",Ted
"How it happened at school today, Ted?",Lily
Something bad happened. This was the first course of the semester...,Ted
"Jamie Adamic. Salvation. Brian Glow-atz. Glau-atz?Salvation. Well done. Add a false name on the call sheet, very original guys. You know, I expected a little maturity, coming from students like you, and frankly, more creative. I mean, seriously, what kind of fake name is Jen Coulin?",Ted
Present.,Student
"Come on guys, you would have at least been able to make it sound right. Jen Coulin?",Ted
Present.,Student
"What happened to classic? Sat Troulcu, Ted and Bill Oukoi, Maby Stoukette, Roland Cule, that's false names, but Jen Coulin?",Ted
Here.,Student
Jen Coulin!,Ted
It's just there.,Student
"Come on, I wait, swing all your jokes about Jen Coulin.",Ted
"We will not make jokes, Ted. I mean, this girl must really be in the hole.",Lily
You really soiled the name of Jen Coulin.,Marshall
Have you finished?,Ted
You asked him if she had reached the right exit?,Robin
"Wow, two in a row, Barney is thoroughly.",Lily
"This is a lucky girl, Barney was my best sh*t.",Robin
And this is the best friend I ever had.,Ted
It is everything I love that Marshall either.,Lily
It's all I want to be.,Marshall
I guess that's just what they said when I was gone.,Barney
"I believe it. You are awesome. Now, night 3. Describe it to us.",Jim
"Jim, I can tell you that I was gone, so I wanted a little spice.",Barney
I think I'll take small tits tonight.,Barney
You're yucky.,Lily
"Lily, it's people too.",Barney
That's your burgers.,Wendy
thank you.,Marshall
Thank you.,Lily
You share it? Your share forever.,Ted
Of course not!,Lily
There is no such Bizarros who share everything.,Marshall
Of course I do.,Robin
That's exactly what you are.,Ted
It is perfectly normal.,Lily
What's happening guys?,Robin
"You know, Lily and I was looking for a new couple of friends since we lost Robin and Barney, and Ted and Stella and Ted and Robin, and Ted... Ted and Victoria, when do you arrive to keep one?",Marshall
How we came up with that?,Ted
"It was a great day out at 4 it was cool, we were relaxed, it was not freaked out.",Lily
"And there, a tiny detail has surfaced, and it ruined the whole evening.",Marshall
"... and the toothbrush Joanna is ejected from the sink, facing the ceiling, and falls straight down the toilet.",Man
"It's crazy that last week, it happened the same with our toothbrushes.",Marshall
Our toothbrush?,Woman
Our toothbrush?,Ted
Our toothbrush?,Jim
Yeah.,Lily
"As in, a toothbrush?",Male
"As in, a toothbrush? You use both?",Robin
Every day?,Jim
That's weird?,Lily
"Marshall, 4 of 5 dentists have just vomited on.",Ted
"Hey, look, Barney has yet fallen one.",Robin
"Wow. 3 girls in 3 nights. This is gross, even from Barney.",Lily
Yuck? Are you kidding? There is no one left to do...,Ted
Do not tell! You're going to jinx him!,Marshall
Wear what bad luck?,Lily
I had left to do... flawless.,Barney
"It was faultless. 7 nights, 7 girls, 0 rejection.",Barney
"Awesome. I mean, it's the equivalent of sexual perfect game in baseball, in even harder.",Jim
Yeah. The only player in history to have accomplished both Pete was Drexell 'The mustache' in 1896.,Barney
"It was not the first time you were about to accomplish. So you knew that one mistake, and we reach the end. Sometimes a teammate makes a mistake. Sometimes a minefield...",Jim
You and me in the closet of the Spanish supermarket next door.,Barney
"... takes you straight into the wall. And sometimes you spread yourself. And it almost always ends badly. But this week, you were to 3 of 3, and no sign of abating.",Jim
"I can even say, without a fault. I'd love to say the same of my friends.",Barney
Jen has not come into being today.,Ted
"Excuse me, Jen?",Marshall
"Yeah, Ted, we know tons of people who call Jen.",Robin
Yeah.,Marshall
Jen Coulin.,Ted
"Oh, you're there. The dreaded call from Dale. Oh, that's my mother. She has big health problems. But why does he not call?",Robin
Wait a second. Want it called?,Lily
No! Shut up! You have not a kind of toothbrush to share or something like that?,Robin
Yeah. When did you start doing that too?,Ted
"It's been years! You had to know, you lived with us.",Marshall
"Yeah, but you always keep your toothbrush in the bathroom, which is, incidentally, also weird.",Ted
We kept her in the bathroom.,Lily
"No, there was a toothbrush in the bathroom, and it was mine.",Ted
"Wait. Are you saying that for 8 years, you have shared a toothbrush every 3?",Robin
Oh my god!,Marshall
Finish me!,Ted
I'm having so much!,Robin
"So you're at four, he'll just make a 5 to 7.",Jim
"Well done, Jim.",Barney
"Hey, I try. I'm not you. It was then comes the night No 5, and trouble with.",Jim
Beer! Salvation.,Ted
Hi. How is Barney?,Marshall
Like a charm. As all week.,Ted
Yeah? Hard to believe.,Marshall
Why?,Ted
"Apparently, this big merger last week went wrong, and Barney wears the hat.",Marshall
"Oh, it's weird. He said nothing.",Lily
"Even I who works with him, I just learned this afternoon when I walked past the office of his boss.",Marshall
"... what it has cost this company, Stinson?!",Pattern
I never thought about Barney so scared.,Marshall
I think he'll get fired.,Marshall
I can not believe that Barney is going to get fired.,Ted
"Yeah, they have a meeting Friday to see if he keeps his job or not.",Marshall
Poor guy. It must pinball.,Robin
I'll go talk to him.,Lily
No! You can not distract a man who is right... you know what.,Ted
"Come on, it's his career. This is much more important than a stupid without...",Lily
"Ahh! Okay. You can lick my hand all you want, I will not let you ruin... Ouch!",Marshall
It must go talk to him.,Lily
I'm going. He needs a brother. Hey buddy.,Ted
Hey!,Barney
Is everything okay?,Ted
Absolutely. A background. It could not get better. I make fun of that? I need you.,Barney
Anything you want. What's the matter?,Ted
Which of these girls look the most stupid?,Barney
Let's see it. Already heated to perfection? The smashed out? Ok I will deal for Big Mac.,Ted
"Thank you, Skip.",Barney
So what did he say?,Lily
"What? Oh, it will try with the girl holding the burger there.",Ted
You were supposed to talk about his loss of job.,Lily
"Lily, why is that force him to face a problem that can not adjust will help?",Ted
And why ignore it will fix things?,Lily
You're much ignored the problems of dental hygiene for a dozen years. And yet you seem to...,Ted
Jen Coulin!,Lily
Jen Coulin.,Robin
Dale you called?,Ted
Why do you...,Robin
"Guys, guys, look!",Marshall
"Barney, I will interrupt you one second, I must ask you something. Have you ever taken Viagra?",Jim
"No, sir. I like to play by the rules. While I can not say I did not propose to.",Barney
It was pretty awesome. You should try it. I still have a few.,Marshall
No thank you.,Barney
"You sure? Ok, do as you like. What time is it?",Marshall
It's 8:00.,Barney
8:00? I have to go to hospital.,Marshall
"I've never touched. I can pee in a jar if you like, Jim Nantz.",Barney
"Barney, I trust you. I miss you even ask the question. Let's talk about the night 6. Two girls prepared to perfection.",Jim
... seriously guys.,Ted
Hey!,Marshall
"Hey, what are you doing here? Returns to the bar!",Ted
"Ted, relax. I am already 6 of 6.",Barney
Really?,Ted
"Yeah. I ate at the Tavern of vegetables, I started talking to the Swedish Top Model, and the next moment we batifolait in the back of a carriage. Go my beautiful, Hue!",Barney
Great. What really happened?,Ted
"I ate at the Staten Island Chili's, and I jumped a hairdresser completely stuffed. Are you happy, Ulysses?",Barney
"Barney, we know that you are going you may get fired. Wait, you ought to speak. You turn away from reality, kissing unnecessarily on all sides.",Lily
"No vain, ok? Between number 5 and I, there was a connection. She will resume her studies, she has a child or who is studying... something with studies.",Barney
Now my students have taught me that Jen Coulin abandon my material.,Ted
"Oh, my God, you've really pushed to the limit.",Marshall
It scales all his education in the toilet.,Robin
News from Dale?,Ted
"It's only been five days, he will call!",Robin
What do you care? You said it was a big con.,Marshall
"Tell Dale not like that, ok? It is twice as good as you never will!",Robin
"God forbid, if you manage to find a job, sell your apartment.Marshall and I, we have a free room. You can stay as long as you want.",Lily
Forget not you bring your toothbrush.,Robin
"Lily, what are you doing?",Ted
I talk to my friend who is going through a difficult period.,Lily
He's doing very well.,Marshall
"Try to sleep with seven women in seven nights, that's not what I would call very well get out. It is a cry for help.",Lily
His whole life is a call for help. But we do not mess with a man who is in the midst of a no...,Ted
"What? Without fault? Flawless, faultless, flawless! Grow up a little!",Lily
"Unbelievable. You know, there are two things that do not.First: you do not open an email from Phil Simms to your children.And second: you do not wear bad luck to a man on track to flawless.",Jim
"I do not know what to tell you, Lily is always trying to ruin me any.",Barney
I think she cracked a bit for the Barnacle.,Jim
"You have the eye to notice such details, Jim Nantz.",Barney
I can not believe that thou hast brought him bad luck.,Ted
He has no chance.,Marshall
"Ok, I have a question. If I ruined everything, why is it that Barney is in the process of hanging the girl three martinis in there?",Lily
"Oh, my God!",Ted
There's going to happen!,Marshall
"Yeah, you know? Doors-jinx, it does not exist.",Lily
"Do not tell me that she dared to say The door-jinx, it does not exist.",Jim
I wish I had power.,Barney
You were about to achieve something so beautiful.,Jim
"Well, thank you to her, the only thing that can prevent a stroke insured was about to walk out the door. A member of the New York Yankees World Champions in 2009.",Barney
"Lily, I'll buy my own toothbrush.",Marshall
"Well, that's it. Barney's still got to 6.",Ted
What? Why? Because the guy with the weird cut went back?,Robin
This is Nick Swisher. It is part of the New York Yankees. No regular guy from New York can not compete with a Yankee.,Marshall
"And this is true for a former Yankee. When I arrived here, I was the fourth date with a girl I loved a lot before I do the fly by Phil Rizzuto.",Ted
"I was there. Damn, this guy could play.",Marshall
I'm still not.,Robin
"Ok, let me do it the Canadian So how do you react if one of those guys with skates and sticks came back here?",Lily
"Lily, if one of the Vancouver Canucks came here, I fall on my ass so that there would be a hole halfway to China in the soil.",Robin
It's the same thing for the Yankees.,Ted
"Oh, Barney's done.",Robin
"It's happening, look.",Marshall
You wanna come to my house and watch the collection of snowballs?,Barney
A collection of snow globes?,Marshall
He is pinball.,Ted
It's Nick Swisher!,Woman
Nice try.,Overall
"It was well played, well played, well played.",Ted
But not play well enough. All this week was a waste of time. And tomorrow I'm getting fired.,Barney
"I'm sorry. But for what it's worth, this week was not a waste of time. We all had a horrible week, and you have helped us change a little air.",Marshall
"Yeah, I got my first drop.",Ted
"I met my soul mate, and he never called back. Well, not yet. He will. He will.",Robin
We frightened a couple great just because we share a toothbrush.,Marshall
You share a toothbrush?,Barney
"Well, they and Ted.",Robin
... Huh?,Barney
"Wait a minute. When we went out together, you borrow the toothbrush all the time.",Ted
"Oh, shit.",Robin
"At the second she sits next to Swisher, we reach the end.",Ted
"Wait a minute! Aldrin was seen. She tries to escape, she jumps, and... I thought she would not do that.",Marshall
"Oh my God, are you?",Woman
"Yeah, sorry. I'm so clumsy! Oh, thank you. I think I twisted my ankle. Do what you can bring me some ice?",Lily
Sure.,Woman
She did! I believe that there is no jinx finally.,Marshall
"I'm bringing ice, Lily.",Wendy
Damn. Swisher is back in play Swisher is back in play!,Marshall
"Follow me. Hey, Nick Swisher! This guy and his wife share a toothbrush!",Ted
And?,Nick
"And it's weird, right?",Ted
"Actually, I think it's cute. Are we not try to find someone who could share his toothbrush?",Nick
"I'm sorry. Lily, Nick Swisher think it's cute.",Marshall
Martini?,Barney
"You take a beer with a Yankee, if that's not cool!",Ted
"That's great, I'm all baseball. Mookie Wilson, while a player eh?",Robin
"Yeah, baseball is great, but I tell you, this is not hockey.",Nick
I live just above.,Robin
What do you say we go home?,Woman
"Wow, to be honest, this is not my habit, but I feel a real connection, Number 7... Christy. I beg you. I did it! I did it!",Barney
Unbelievable. Congratulations on your faultless.,Jim
"Thank you, Jim. I would never have done it without the help of my friends.",Barney
"Hey, on another subject, you really think you could get fired today?",Jim
"Uh, Jim, I told you I wanted to talk about it.",Barney
"Barney, I go straight from your imagination, so apparently we must talk! Think about it.",Jim
What a c**t.,Barney
You're the idiot.,Jim
Mr. Donovan will see you now.,Woman
I barely slept.,Barney
"That's the guy, the official caps of no fault of Barney. I was going to make t-shirts, but you know, sizes, all that, and it would hurt me to think.",Marshall
"In commemoration, at the entrance to the Barney legend, this tie, worn during his seventh night of her flawless, freshly removed.",Lily
"May the heroic story of Barney to be remembered, and transmitted from generation to generation.",Marshall
"I already see myself in front of my children, trying to tell them when their uncle Barney kissed 7 chicks in a row.",Ted
A command to Coulin Jen? It has a large commission for Jen Coulin here.,Wendy
"You send Wendy to say now? Go! It's good, I understood.Jen Coulin is a crap name, and it becomes increasingly shitty when it is repeated. Jen Coulin. Jen Coulin. Jen Coulin.",Ted
Present.,Jen
"Well, that explains where Barney is.",Ted
Dibs on his wings!,Robin
"Hey, guys!",Barney
Hey!,Ted
Does anyone know who won the Superbowl?,Barney
You were there. It was the...,Marshall
"I won! Because I'm now in possession of a magic phone that always rings. And you know who's always usually on the other end? A chick. So how many chicks do I have calling me now? Infinity! Guys, remember Ranjit?",Barney
Hello.,Ranjit
"Hey, Ranjit!",Ted
Good to see you.,Marshall
OK I've enlisted Ranjit's services as my personal driver because for the next week I'll be sleeping with hundreds of women and I don't want to take the subway cause... you know... germs!,Barney
"Wait, you're... you're actually gonna hook up with these girls that call you?",Ted
"Oh, indubitably! I'm meeting the first one here any minute. Keep your eyes pealed for a red sweater. Based on her texts, she's dirty, dyslexic and want to 96 me, semi-colon and parenthesis.",Barney
This ought to be good. I can only imagine the quality of girls...,Ted
"Magic phone, guys. ",Barney
"Oh, hey guys, hey Ranjit.",Robin
Hey.,Lily
How's it going?,Marshall
That beer looks a little flat.,Ted
"Nuh, it's scotch.",Robin
"Something troubling you, kiddo?",Ted
Hhhhh Don.,Robin
Oh yeahh!,Don
Now that's what I call having a woof over your head. Don. DON?,Robin
"Why is Ulee's Gold in every crossword? On to me? Sorry, sorry... Next Sunday is Valentine's Day. And one lucky patient will be receiving a very special chocolate heart: a human heart. OK, that reminds me, I've been meaning to ask you... Robin, do you have any Valentine's Day plans?",Don
He asked you out?,Lily
He asked me out.,Robin
That's crazy! And they use Ulee because of the vowels.,Ted
What did you say?,Marshall
"Well we were on the air, I was on the spot, so I said OK.",Robin
"Oh, oh, oh!",Lily
"Robin, you're gonna marry this man so freaking hard, right in the butt.",Marshall
What? Nooo I HATE Don. And now I can't cancel because I said I would go out with him on the air.,Robin
What would your viewers think?,Marshall
"Wow wow wow, you said you'd go out with him on Valentine's? I thought we had plans!",Ted
Getting drunk and cleaning the apartment was a plan?,Robin
I did NOT...say... it was a good plan.,Ted
"Guys, guys, guys, we're on me now. And it is getting in-teh-resting. Looks at these texts. Read this one. Yowza! Now look at this one. Does she text her mother with those fingers? Now look at this one... or this one, or this one, or this one, or...",Barney
"OK OK OK buddy, how about you do this? Go nail that girl, then read your texts.",Ted
"I can't do that, Ted. I just can't hook up with a girl if there is a hotter girl out there with whom up can be hooked.",Barney
Isn't there always a hotter girl?,Lily
"I know, isn't it wonderful? ",Barney
"So there's a hotter girl. Isn't that the problem in a nutshell? There's too many options. You got internet dating, you got bars...",Ted
Holding up your phone number on national TV.,Lily
"I never had that problem. When I was 18, I had an arranged marriage. And I love my wife more and more every day.",Ranjit
Hm.,Ted
It is true. It's very rare that two people just meet and fall madly in love... like Robin and Don.,Marshall
"Oh but we're not even like going out for dinner, we're just hanging out at his place.",Robin
"No, it's not like that. It's just us and a bunch of other people.",Robin
"Wait, Robin, what exactly did Don say when he asked you out?",Lily
I'm having some friends over at my place for a party. You should come by if you want.,Don
Errrrrrr...I... OK.,Robin
"Robin, Don didn't ask you out.",Lily
"Err, of course he asked me out.",Robin
Err no he didn't.,Ted
"Yes, he did. He did. He did. He DID!",Robin
OK.,Ranjit
"Well, dog my cats! I think I know what's going on here. Robin... did you WANT Don to ask out?",Marshall
Whaaat?!! ,Robin
"See! That right there is what free will gets you. Constant ego-shattering uncertainty. I'm done with that. I want what Ranjit has. I've spent my entire adult life looking for the perfect woman and I'm spending Valentine's Day scrubbing the toilet. I need someone else to find me that woman. Marshall, Lily, arrange-marriage me!",Ted
nan,Barney
You want us to arrange your marriage?,Marshall
"Absolutely. Looks there's two sides to dating, right? Picking and getting picked. Getting picked, I'm good at. Ladies looove Teddy Westside.",Ted
"You're waiting for me to comment on your self-assigned nickname? Well, here's my comment. I love it.",Marshall
Really?! ,Ted
Teddy Westside? Continue.,Marshall
"It's the picking, I suck at. I pick the wrong girls. But you guys, you're the best pickers I know. You picked each other.",Ted
Oh well with the slight assist from the Wesleyan housing department.,Lily
And a healthy splash of Drakkar Noir. ,Marshall
"Get out there and find me a girl. We'll double date on Valentine's Day. If I like her, I will marry her... if she's cool with it. And she will be. Cause I'll wear my nice blazer.",Ted
I love that blazer. Almost as much as Robin loves Don.,Marshall
I do not love Don.,Robin
"Robin, neurologically speaking, the part of the human brain that makes you hate people is located right next to the part of the brain that makes you want to jump people's bones. The two responses are so similar, it's hard to tell them apart.",Marshall
"You know what it's like? Wait, I have to get a book. Give me 30 seconds.",Ted
"OK this is fun. Look at this picture. It's a rabbit! You can look at it for hours and be absolutely sure it's a rabbit. But then one day, you look at it and you realize, wait a second, it's a duck! Rabbit, duck, rabbit, duck. Isn't it fun?",Ted
"Relationships are like that. I mean, look, when you first met Don, you hated him, you thought This guy's a duck, but one of these days you're gonna realize This is actually someone that I love, he's a rabbit.",Marshall
"Wow I think you got it backwards there, buddy. The duck is the thing you love, the rabbit is the thing you hate.",Ted
What?!!,Marshall
"Yeah I got to agree. Duck's up, rabbit down.",Robin
Definitely. Ducks are better than rabbits.,Lily
"I got... ducks are... ducks are... rabbits are adorable. Ducks are aargh. Have you ever been in a fight with a duck? I mean, ducks are... jerks.",Marshall
Duck is delicious. Rabbit is all gamey.,Ted
nan,Marshall
nan,Ted
Who carries a duck's foot for good luck? Anyone?,Marshall
You wrap yourself in a comforter stuffed with rabbit hair. ,Robin
"Hold on, I've got to get another book.",Ted
"Then why don't we take, a rabbit, a duck, stick 'em in a cardboard box and let them fight it out?",Ted
"Because it's illegal, Ted!",Marshall
"Only if we bet on it, Marshall!",Ted
FINE! I CAN SEE IT! YOU WIN!,Marshall
Say it.,Robin
You have to say it.,Ted
Duck's good... ,Marshall
YAYYYYY.,Robin
YAY.,Lily
YESSS.,Ted
"Thank you. And Don is, and always will be, a rabbit.",Robin
"Oh I wouldn't be so sure about that, Robin. Think about it. Don... Donald. Donald... Duck. ",Ted

"Here comes the groom in his favorite blazer, gonna meet my wife and I'm...laser, tazer, gaze her, take, bathe her?",Ted
"Hey, Ted?",Robin

"Before you go meet your future wife, why don't you swing by Don's party with me?",Robin

"Yeah, why?",Robin
He's a duck. That dude be straight-ducking. And I think that I'll amaze her. Nailed it!,Ted
"Look, Robin, I don't wanna crowd you on your little date here, so if things start to get hot and heavy with Don...",Ted
They're not gonna get...,Robin
"I'm just saying, if they do... I'll just say Well, I got a dinner res and then, wait this is the last part, I've been working on it for a while... I'll duck out.",Ted
"Ha ha ha. It's not gonna get happen... but yeah, do that!",Robin
"Hello, Robin. ",Don
"Well, I got a dinner res... ",Ted
"Come... god, Don, what the hell are you doing?",Robin
"I don't know. It's something called the Naked Man. I read about it on some guy's blog. My god, I'm so stupid, why did I ever think it would work on someone like you?",Don
"Yeah, cause I would never, could like, standards, so... you know... I thought this was a party.",Robin
I only said that to get you to come over here. I didn't think you'd bring a date.,Don
Ted's not my date. He's a friend.,Robin
"Oh god, you probably think I'm some kind of playboy now, right?",Don
nan,Robin
So he's a rabbit. At least you know for sure.,Ted
"Ted, this may hurt a little, I'm recycling your old Architecture Weekly magazines.",Robin
What are you doing?,Ted
Cleaning. You go on your date. Happy Valentine's Day.,Robin
"Oh, thank god, you're here!",Marshall
"Yeah, I've been thinking, hmm, maybe we should call this whole thing off...",Ted

Ted's her least favorite person in the world.,Lily
"Well, she's not getting any younger.",Marshall
"Get rid of it. This phone is cursed. Cursed, I tell you! I tried to ignore it but it just never stops ringing. It's ruining my life! I should get that. ",Barney
"Barney, Barney, let it go... to voicemail. ",Ranjit
nan,Barney
We have to find Ted a wife. We're being too choosey. It almost doesn't matter who it is at this point,Marshall
It's a phone girl!?,Ted
"I know, I know... but no, then we met her and Ted... she's a world-class violinist, she's a gourmet cook and she can quote every line from Caddy Shack.",Marshall
Wow.,Ted
"Oh but Natalia, tell Ted the problem.",Marshall
"Yeah, yeah, tell him, tell him!",Lily
"Well, unfortunately I'm going to have to leave the country soon because my visa is about to expire.",Natalia

What?,Ted
"It's a pre-fixed menu for Valentine's Day and we're already out of the steak, fish and chicken. So rabbit or duck?",Waiter
"Rabbit. Sorry, guys, I gotta go. ",Ted
Why would Ted order the rabbit if he's just gonna run out?,Marshall
"I need it back. Where is the phone? Well, heeellooooo. Oh I met you already. Where is the phone?",Barney
It's hidden.,Lily
Where?,Barney
You go on your date. Happy Valentine's Day.,Robin
Barney's phone... I wonder how it got in there?,Ted

Uh what's the harm... Hello!,Ted
Terrific. I will see you there. And I'll be the guy in the awesome blazer. Ah ah ah I think you'll know the blazer when you see it. Oooh! I gotta go.,Ted

It's mine now.,Ted
It's not your phone. ,Barney
Lily. ,Marshall
nan,Lily
Being single sucks. It turns you into a crazy person.,Ted
I know. So much running around and freaking out. For what?,Robin
So long as you can find someone you can sit on the couch and put off cleaning the bathroom with.,Ted
"Well, the joke's on the rest of the world cause we can do that on our own.",Robin
Exactly.,Ted
Exactly.,Robin
"Robin, I have to apologize...",Don
Save it. Let's just do the news.,Robin
"No. Listen... after you left the other night, I was embarrassed. Not because I was naked. I'm actually pretty OK with my body.",Don
Clearly.,Robin
"I got married in college. I just got divorced three months ago. I have no idea how to be single. But that's not why I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed by my behavior right here at Channel...hmm, it starts with a 1, I know that, but...",Don
12.,Robin
12!...,Don
You can... just look at your mug.,Robin
"Right. Well, no, you look at this mug ",Don
"Well, I'll believe that when I see it.",Robin
"Well, you'll see it right now. I'll go get you some coffee.",Don
Don!! You're wearing pants!,Robin
"Well, look at that!",Don
nan,Robin
"Friends, tonight is the night. I invite Tiffany home to see my collection of vintage cameras.",Ted
It's the lure of Ted.,Barney
Bait?,Lily
A true gentleman invents an excuse to bring home a respectable lady. Something interesting or beautiful that can claim to admire for 5 minutes before it starts on the track.,Barney
As if she had to borrow a book or listen to old vinyl.,Ted
Or see your new poster rap.,Marshall
Post rap? On which it would work?,Robin
It was the first week of college. I was way into Wu-Tang Clan.,Lily
"It's tricky. It must be interesting enough that the girl up, but not too much not to spoil the evening.",Barney
The slot machine is too much fun. And a trampoline... that's actually too dangerous. But I finally found the perfect bait... A mini pig.,Barney
A mini pig? On which it would work?,Ted
You got a mini pig?,Lily
You can see the mini pig?,Robin
I can borrow your mini pig?,Ted
"Yes, you can borrow.",Barney
You have a mini pig? I can not believe it! You're too cute!You're the cutest little pig on Earth! What?,Tiffany
You've always been so beautiful? You're going out on In high school I was super shy and I in my skin?,Ted
I was shy and ill at ease. I'd like 50 more pounds and protruding teeth.,Tiffany
Seriously?,Ted
No. I was always canon. What can I do? You know who else would love this mini pig?  My boyfriend.,Tiffany
You got a boyfriend?,Ted
"I know... Boring, eh? Finally, it is... not really my boyfriend.",Tiffany
Okay.,Ted
"Well, technically it is.",Tiffany
He is or not?,Ted
A little each but not both.,Tiffany
Do you understand anything?,Ted
"I appreciate you. But you must be patient. I do not want to lose you, my Dark Brown.",Tiffany
Someone does not want to lose his Dark Brown.,Ted
She gave you her hook.,Robin
What? I am not to his hook.,Ted
"Yes, completely.",Barney
"It gives you false hope, but it does not engage with you, but it keeps you in the corner, just in case, like... an old canned chili in the pantry.",Robin
Who would buy a can of chili for not eating it away?,Lily
"Amen, sister.",Marshall
"Do you feel pretty good. It is gone. It was on both sides. I was hooked and crocheter. It's good guys. I was shameless, but I did not have money problems.",Robin
"I've been hooked. Lisa Walker. See the scene... In 1994, St. Cloud, Minnesota.",Marshall
"So I was, like, thinking, Lisa, do, perhaps you want, like, go out with me?",Marshall
"It sounds great. But I'm seeing this guy. It has a LeBaron convertible and an unlimited pass to the rink, so I would not miss it.",Lisa
I understand.,Marshall
What if we did that? You could be my secret boyfriend who does all my homework.,Lisa
Okay. Wanna see my post of rap?,Marshall
Whore posting!,Lily
So... Lisa Walker gave me false hope for months until one night I went to tell him how much I loved her. In song.,Marshall
"She was not home yet so I waited. And expected. I woke up, covered with snow, after 4h. And then I saw them. The footprints of Lisa. She had passed right by me to the house.",Marshall
It was fine in the end. It freed me from its hook.,Marshall
That's not the same with me and Tiffany. Listen.,Ted
You interest me very much. But I can not be with you for now.,Tiffany
Right now is the catch phrase of choice.,Robin
"For now you draw a picture of a future where everything will be magical, but in truth, it'll never happen.",Marshall
It's like that. I can not be with you. For now.,Barney
"I think my high school boyfriend Scooter, is a little to my hook.",Lily
A little? Completely. The poor showed up at our wedding hope you recover.,Marshall
It's weird when I see him at work.,Lily
Wait. What?,Marshall
Scooter works in the Ikea cafeteria 'school. We talked.,Lily
Nice dress. French fries? I love you.,Scooter
We certainly do not talk about that!,Marshall
But if. I talked to full time. Scooter canteen.,Lily
"I thought you was talking about a long-awaited means of transport, carrying such poor canteen.",Marshall
It explains a lot.,Lily
Scooter canteen was still there today.,Lily
You're mounted on it? You did a tour?,Marshall
No!,Lily
Really? In your place I would have rode this scooter all day to break it into two.,Marshall
So these poor women must still walk? Expect. Scooter works in your school?,Marshall
Are you jealous?,Lily
I feel bad for Scooter. It took this job just because he thinks he has a chance with you. You must ensure that he understands that it is wrong for it turns the page and gets a real work canteen. Shit!,Marshall
I tried!,Lily
I saw that you had free time. So do I. And if you fled?,Scooter
"Let me be clear, Scooter. There is no way that you and I are together. For now.",Lily
See you tomorrow. It's Tuesday Tijuana.,Scooter
For now? You got to the earnest Scooter? You must release your scooter hook.,Marshall
"You're right. Tomorrow, that's what I'll do.",Lily
Why not tomorrow?,Marshall
I can not spoil the Tijuana Tuesday.,Lily
Really? You really gonna sit and watch the door all night because Tiffany said she would try to pass?,Barney
I will not give up.,Ted
This girl is special.,Ted
It will get better with Tiffany.,Ted
"Ted, let me be clear. That girl is poison and you have to forget your life forever.",Barney
There she is.  It has led to colleagues.,Ted
Hold on to it. Never lets go! I have never seen more beautiful girls. They all work with Tiffany?,Barney
Yep.,Ted
"There can be only one explanation for that. Tiffany is a representative... e, pharmaceuticals?",Barney
How do you know?,Ted
And you never thought to say?,Barney
What? It's just a job.,Ted
"That a b... Since time immemorial there has always been a professional edge to which girls g*n, like Tiffany, have flocked. I'll redo the story?",Barney
I will not say explicitly.,Ted
"It began 2.5 million years ago. The man was a hunter.So the profession's sexiest moment? Picker. h*m* erectus, indeed. With improved technology, the profession's sexiest moment was changing. I'm sure it's a hernia. You can double-check? And then the man grabbed the heavens. So girls sexy stiletto heels began and became a flight attendant. I'm right and ready to fire. Then the man said, Life is hard. I should start taking lots of drugs.  So sexy girls landed in medical offices, hot enough to make these pills erection ironically unnecessary. So today, girls are pharma's sexiest moment.",Barney
Hi my great darkness. How are you?,Tiffany
"Okay. In fact, you've dumped your loser of guy?",Ted
"No, sir.",Tiffany
She touched my nose.,Ted
"Largue Tiffany and join the Barnacle in a buffet of girls pharma. There may be loss of clothing, knees b*rned, respiratory weakness and sore abs the next day. That the world give a damn five?!",Barney
"I know you're having trouble dropping Scooter. I decided that you need training. And you say that the problem is his sad eyes?  Okay, shut up, woman. Now I want you to look this mini pig and you tell him it is impossible for you to be with him one day.",Marshall
"Mini Pig, it is impossible that I may one day with you. For now.",Lily
Go! Be a man!,Marshall
"I'm sorry, but it is just so cute. I just want to cuddle him all day. Oh, yes.",Lily
"You know, it's funny. I remember when you told me stuff like that.",Marshall
I still do.,Lily
Not as much. Not as much.,Marshall
"There's no nights like with pharma pharma because the nights never stop! Dude, I've flirted with three of them. The fantasy. In addition, my cholesterol is low. My restless legs syndrome is cured. I am more alive than ever.",Barney
"Friends, good news. Tiffany broke up with her boyfriend. So I'm not the hook.",Ted
You're always on the hook.,Robin
Look what we did yesterday.,Ted
"First, it was spoiled. Then we shared a chocolate cake.Then, well, I did not used to join the discussions of changing rooms, but I made her a foot massage... rather sensual.",Ted
And let me guess: it's not gone further than that.,Robin
"Well, no, but...",Ted
"And tell me, would you have accidentally made this chocolate cake?",Lily
It was a pre-made.,Ted
There's no shame to admit it. We were all hooked and we all hooked someone.,Lily
I've never done that.,Ted
Are you kidding? And this daughter of the university library? Henrietta?,Robin
Henrietta and I are just friends.,Ted
It is too much to your hook.,Robin
Absolutely not.,Ted
"You like to have Henrietta close for the same reason that Tiffany likes to have you close, it flatters the ego.",Robin
You amaze me that such an expert is to keep people on your hook. And this poor cameraman your job?,Ted
Mike and I are just friends.,Robin
Come on.,Ted
"Yeah, right.",Robin
You never thought to go to the next step with me?,Mike
"If you mean to do my laundry, I'm starting lineup.",Robin
It's a deal.,Mike
What! I do not keep Mike in my hook.,Robin
You're Captain Hook.,Ted
"Dude, I'm a girl. Our female parts are like a cobweb.Sometimes you jokes of things you want to.",Robin
That's not why it's good.,Ted
"And Henrietta, in any way, are not losing time with you, huh?",Robin
"Henrietta knows we're just friends. In fact, I'll call and get away with it tonight, friends.",Ted
I love you. What? Want a foot massage? Because I'm driven on me.,Henrietta
"No, that's fine.",Ted
"I did not know if you were hungry, I did some stuff... Nothing special.",Henrietta
Hello?,Ted
Hey Ted!,Tiffany
Hey Tiffany!,Ted
I go to the country this weekend at a friends wedding.Wanna be my cavalier?,Tiffany
"I would love that. What are you doing here? Great. See you in 10 minutes. Super. Sorry, Henrietta, something unexpected.We redo it, my friend?",Ted
"Yeah, it's not a concern.",Henrietta
"It works, yeah.",Ted
You have the strength.,Henrietta
"An unexpected, okay, Mom?",Henrietta
I told you there was not.,Father
I heard.,Henrietta
Champagne?,Ted
I forgot to call you.,Tiffany
"Whatever it is, we can talk now.",Ted
This is Jack. This is the man at the wedding. We just get back together.,Tiffany
Now that I think a call would have been nice.,Ted
Is that you Ted? But I heard you were doing a great chocolate cake.,Jack
It is not great? And it is in a group. Thank you.,Tiffany
"Come on, Lily. You must drop Scooter. Try it again.",Marshall
Mini pig... I do not wanna be with you. For now.,Lily
Act like a man!,Marshall
Mini pig... I do not wanna be with you. Ever.,Lily
Finish him!,Marshall
It will never be together in any sexual way again.,Lily
Well done. Weird thing to say to a pig.,Marshall
Really bad.,Lily
"Well, I do not think it will work out between us. For now.",Tiffany
"You've missed so much, baby.",Tiffany
You know what? That will not work between us... ever. I'm done.  And that's really better for traffic if you weight the arch with your thumbs. Now I'm done.,Ted
I can do it alone.,Lily
So prove it. And... take me a pudding.,Marshall
"Listen, Scooter. There is no way we ever be together.",Lily
Right now! I'm sorry but he is adorable.,Marshall
Listen. I want to be with you.,Lily
So far. Hang in there. I will not be eternal.,Marshall
Yesterday I was with this girl so sexy that pharma should call a doctor if you have no erection for more than 4h. I have no reason people?,Barney
There is no one. Just the girl with whom you came out recently.,Robin
I want you to meet the latest arrival.,Woman
Let's go have a drink.,Woman
It's over.,Barney
What?,Robin
The girls of pharma are more than g*n. This is the end of an era.,Barney
You're a little dramatic.,Robin
"Really? It starts with a Gladys. And suddenly, a few gay guys not so fabulous fall into the ranks. And before you know it, the girls look like pharma team to a Southwest flight to Albuquerque in Little Rock. It's over!",Barney
This is Jack. This is the man at the wedding.,Tiffany
I'm done.,Ted
The answer is yes!,Henrietta
It's worse.,Ted
"This is perfect! Mom, Dad! Ted asked me to marry him!",Henrietta
I knew this would happen!,Mother
My son!,Father
"Yeah, there was a...",Ted
What did you do?,Robin
"Honestly, I thought to marry him just out of sheer embarrassment. But I did the right thing. I did what anyone who has someone should hook her. I would have broken my heart.",Ted
"Henrietta, I'm sorry if it's brutal but I think you duty. I do not wanna be with you.",Ted
Right now?,Henrietta
Ever.,Ted
"But we're still going to marry, does not it?",Henrietta
It was violent.,Ted
"Sorry, big guy. Honesty is hard, but ultimately it is the softer alternative.  I must tell you something. You've finished the laundry fragile?",Robin
Another tour.,Mike
It can wait.,Robin
How are you?,Robin
You still broies black to the end of the era of the daughters of pharma?,Ted
I've realized that their reign had to stop to give way to a sexy new profession. It may be... communications officer in an intergalactic spaceship to a distant solar system that we can imagine. Maybe it will be... contract. It is not known. But one thing is certain. The future shines... as a huge sun throwing rays of orange light over our heads and our spirits.,Barney
Why change your mind?,Robin
"The realization that hope springs eternal. Ca and the little purple pill box found in my bag. I do not know what they are, but they are amazing!",Barney
"Okay, big guy, tell me all along.",Police
It all started a week ago.,Barney
I spent time at a local bar. Entered... a lady.,Barney
Nothing is sexier than a man wearing a nice tie.,Woman
Aside from a woman who appreciates a nice tie.,Barney
But this is merely a tie.,Woman
It was not my best tie.,Barney
Right.,Police
"So, right after that, I took her home.",Barney
"When I'm in bed with a man, my body becomes a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger to satisfy every single... the carnal desires of my lover.",Woman
"Fortunately, the cleaning lady comes tomorrow.",Barney
Good night.,Woman
"What? Wait, what? I thought your body would become a machine fueled by desire, greed and a hunger only to satisfy my every carnal desires.",Barney
I really think Don and I found our rhythm to work.,Robin
Thanks to this young woman to my left. This report on how rodent avoided in the subway...,Don
The answer might surprise you. It's all rodents.,Robin
"I gotta go, okay? See you soon.",Don
Nice to meet you.,Marshall
I do too.,Don
"This guy is awesome. It's funny, smart, beautiful. You have him to nab it before someone else.",Marshall
I hope you do not talk to you.,Robin
It's been 4 months since you broke up with Barney. It's time to get back on the market.,Lily
"Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier.",Marshall
"I could be more unfortunate. All night, she goes back on me. I brought her back home and she runs away? When I loose a daughter, I am polite to sleep with her before. It is good manners.",Barney
"It looks like she has read this book, Of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail. What? It was this book that helps girls find a husband. It is that of Robin. I just laminated. Okay! Barney, when you were with this girl, she subtly used the word sex?",Ted
"I'm in the inter-gender-ing, and I have some sex-seconds before the light turns green. And then, everyone honks, and it really sex, but I can not run because a jogger slips and falls in the Sacraments of sex-horse.",Woman
Continuous. Continues.,Barney
Did she used an excuse for physical contact?,Ted
It's the cashmere?,Woman
Kashmir? This is the virgin merino hand-woven. The fibers of this costume are spaced less than 12 microns.,Barney
12 microns. I like the tight fibers.,Female
"Well, you're lucky, because mine are the tightest. And touched, they are more gentle.",Barney
She did it too!,Barney
"And here's the final test. Next time, invite the following evening. The book says that it is forbidden, then surely it will give you a bogus excuse, like, I can not tomorrow night. I have already planned to clean my garage and I take a bubble bath.But why not next week? ",Ted
"You try this shit of course you're alone, look at you, poor trail.",Barney
"It's not crap. Sure you're alone, look at you, poor trail, is a brilliant book. And it scares the guys who only want the ass.",Woman
Did you just say you got a kid!,Barney
You'd be surprised how many assholes we cross. That is why my book says to never sleep at first date.,Woman
Completely.,Barney
Or the second. Or the third.,Woman
Of course. Well...,Barney
Or the fourth.,Woman
Just tell me how!,Barney
17.,Female
"Excuse me, someone is using this stool?",Barney
That is: no sex before hot date 17th.,Ted
"If you're not going to take her 17th hot date, you should give up.",Lily
"I will not give up, but yes. For, thanks to the book of Ted...",Barney
From Robin is Robin.,Ted
I can have two shots ahead. There is a flaw in there and I will get it.,Barney
Listen... You wanna go out on Saturday night?,Don
Saturday night?,Robin
It invites you to come out? Say yes! Say yes!,Marshall
"Don... Listen, it's... it's really nice of you, and you're really great...",Robin
"Robin, you okay?",Don
"I just have a cold. That's why for my voice.  But great for Saturday night. One can go to a restaurant grill, and you could bring a first side for my friends Marshall. I gotta go. Kisses.",Marshall
But what are you doing?,Robin
"You have to do, okay? A great guy like Don, it's rare.And speaking of rare, first one side, do not forget. Thank you.",Marshall
I can not believe. Friends... This is it! She wrote the book! It must be named Anita. My plan was to sleep with her but it changes everything. New plan: I'll sleep with her.,Barney
"That girl that Barney hunting, it seems a somewhat anti-Barney. I like the way the universe has decided to collect.",Lily
"Actually, Anita Barney went to see him because I have requested.",Robin
You told to go and see Anita Barney? How you know her?,Lily
It was my show.,Robin
"But, uh... if you had to summarize your book in less than 30 words...",Robin
"I would summarize in one, Robin. And that word is no.By saying no constantly and consistently, it gives a power, simultaneously transforming any fool in human wreck, subject, and whining.",Anita
"Is not this the dream of all women? After the break, we'll talk about your new book, Of course you have not yet retirement plan, look at you, poor trail, scheduled for June We come back after the break.",Robin
It's good. You want a coffee?,Mike
"Absolutely, Mike, great idea.",Robin
You?,Mike
"No. And you, Robin? You go out with someone?",Anita
I have not really want right now.,Robin
You were broken heart?,Anita
"And then I told him everything. It came out at once. And in the end, she said...",Robin
"That Barney needs a lesson. Give me the order, and I will destroy it.",Anita
That's to say?,Robin
I will use the power of no to destroy your friend Barney.Say it.,Anita
"Come on, it does not really work, though?",Robin
"I knew not what you wanted when I caught you a cappuccino, espresso, latte, decaf... and a Turkish coffee.",Mike
"Thank you, Mike. Think about it.",Anita
"I never thought that I would think, but... I thought about it.",Robin
"This Pilates teacher broke all scores. Imagine Robin, but younger. And bigger breasts. Not bigger, but more shapely.And larger.  I put on the StairMaster and...",Barney
It does.,Robin
"Spoilers. Regardless, we did.",Barney
"It's done.  Thank you, Mike.",Anita
"I know it was stupid, but, see, at that time, I was still depressed over the break. I was in my phase of mourning. It means a lot of tape and long nights at the sh**ting range.",Robin
I hope this was not the same nights.,Lily
"Serious, Lily. I do not remember everything.",Robin
You knew that Robin was in mourning? It looked good after the break.,Marshall
"You know her. She keeps her emotions for her. But yes, I saw her crying sometimes.",Lily
She cried? Real tears? It means...,Marshall
"Yeah, Barney sees girls, it could not be happier. You see, this guy has been very active. Sexually. Finally, it is like that... bang... bang... bang... You see? It's like... bang... bang...",Marshall
How could you let me do? You're my wife. You must avoid that I ridiculed in public.,Marshall
"I know, but the song is rather catchy.",Lily
Shit. I read this entire book and I find no fault. What will I do?,Barney
There is another option... but you're not ready.,Ted
Tell me.,Barney
"If you must conclude in one hot date, a date that must be crazy. I do not speak of a restaurant-cine. Or mini golf. I speak of... 17 romantic rendezvous grouped into one incredible night. I mean... a super hot date.",Ted
A great date? It's not very catchy. And if I say a mega date?,Barney
"If you want my help, it's a super hot date.",Ted
Okay.,Barney
Let me do it. I will plan everything.,Ted
You're going to plan everything? This is cutesy and romantic?,Barney
Cutesy and romantic?  No need to take him to Paris or Peru...,Ted
What are you doing?,Barney
They look at us.,Barney
How important it is for you...,Ted
Really? You really gonna do that?,Barney
It looks to me like cutesy and romantic. Box strip?,Barney
Box strip.,Ted
Tonight is the big night. Where do you take D-Bag?This is a bad nickname for Don. I will look better.,Marshall
I just... I canceled.,Robin
How does it... Wait.,Marshall
A problem?,Lily
Robin canceled his hot date.,Marshall
What? She was super excited there is one hour.,Ted
You look like the classiest and most expensive of all prostitutes.,Ted
Thank you.,Robin
You're excited to go out with Don?,Ted
You know what? Looks good. Do not tell Marshall.,Robin
"I will say nothing. I bet you will spend a good evening. And not, however, a great night. A great night will be spent by Barney during his date with Anita. A carriage ride, dinner at Tombeur panties. They call it a super hot date.",Ted
Ted! How could you do that?! Robin has just released his period of mourning!,Marshall
She seemed happy after the break.,Ted
You see nothing. Typical of a guy. She was obviously devastated.,Marshall
"Wait, but that would mean...",Ted
You sing what?,Ted
A song about the number of girls that Barney has typed recently.,Marshall
I'll sing a verse.,Ted
Super.,Marshall
Where is she?,Ted
I think it is the toilet.,Marshall
"I'm fine, I'm fine.",Robin
Why did you do that?,Barney
"Because I am angry against you. And against me. Ted and cons. And frankly, I still am against the Empire.",Marshall
Why are you angry against me?,Barney
You were a real assh*le to Robin when she was in her period of mourning.,Ted
The period of mourning? She has not had a period of mourning.,Barney
You see nothing.,Ted
Typical of a guy.,Marshall
"Barney, sit down, there are two three things to tell you.",Lily
"What, she is upset?",Barney
"Of course she is upset. Look at you, poor trail.",Lily
You should have seen.,Barney
I'm going.,Robin
We go back home...,Barney
I can not believe that Robin is upset.,Barney
And hast me you vomit in your Stormtrooper helmet.,Marshall
I did worse after the premiere of The Phantom Menace.It's been like that since we broke up?,Barney
"Well, it was much better before you decide to go to your stupid super hot date with Anita. And now she broods, God knows where.",Lily
I know where.,Barney
"Barney, what's up? I thought you had a super hot date.",Robin
I know you're upset.,Barney
"What? No. I've never been happier. Anita and this seems great. I'm so glad... by the merest chance, you found yourself. It warms my f*cking heart.",Robin
You sure you're not upset?,Barney
Of course I do. Do not you see how to talk continually of your conquests makes me feel like another number for you?,Robin
You're not another number for me.,Barney
"And now you to take Anita you barely know, this extraordinary hot date, then you do not ever offered me that. It's just that... It sucks, that's all. It sucks.",Robin
"I knew I was a bad boyfriend, but I had no idea that I was worse in the former boyfriend. I'm sorry. How can I be forgiven?",Barney
"Nothing, Barney. You've already proven I'm not important to you.",Robin
"Stop saying that, I'm serious. Ask me what you want.",Barney
Do not sleep with Anita.,Robin
I promise.,Barney
Of course you'll sleep with her. Why is this super hot date if not?,Robin
It will not go super hot date. It is you who will go.,Barney
I wanted to call you.,Barney
"I violate any rules in my coming here, but... no one asks me rabbit like that, so we go out or not?",Anita
"I'm sorry, I... I made a promise to a friend. I must say no.",Barney
"I see. You try the trick of no. You really think it'll work?Because it will not work. Okay, I'll make a deal. Maybe... you might get lucky after the 12th hot date.",Anita
No.,Barney
The 11th?,Anita
No.,Barney
The fifth?,Anita
No.,Barney
Tonight?,Anita
No.,Barney
This evening before dinner?,Anita
No.,Barney
Yeah.,Ted
Go.,Anita
I'm sorry. The answer is no.,Barney
"Well. Because my answer is no, too. This is my last offer.",Anita
Here is my story.,Barney
This is a $ 500 fine for having jumped into the river. I hope it was worth it.,Police
I hope so too.,Barney
This is an old story of married women.,Ted
How was this date?,Marshall
Good enough. Pretty... pretty good.,Robin
How so?,Ted
"Come on, guys. It was good. It was nice. We spent a pleasant evening. Let... Let him that. Even if...",Robin
It's my birthday!,Lily
It's still my birthday!,Lily
"Feliz cumpleanos, baby. The theme of this breakfast in bed is... Spanish Interlude.  How have we landed on the lyric rolling hills of northern Spain? Baby, it will be huge tonight. We five, dinner well dressed, and Ted brings your cognac cheesecake Pumpkin at Edgar. I'll go shopping super secret birthday. And I took him because I do not like the way he looks at you.",Marshall
"A new camera! Thank you, Marshall. I love it!",Lily
"Small bonus, I took pictures of me naked before packing. With a node.",Marshall
There was not a knot.,Lily
On the other device.,Marshall
Thank you. I will make great photos of our group with that.,Lily
I want the perfect group sh*t. Marshall put yourself between Robin and Barney.,Lily
Why?,Barney
"You know... Light, color, balance, aperture...",Lily
"You say stuff pictures. Expect. You do not want it to look like a couple, right?",Robin
Of course. You will not last! The photo is forever.,Lily
How dare you?,Barney
It's so rude.,Robin
It's true.,Barney
"Totally. It is a tightrope, but still.",Robin
"Okay, I am perhaps a little bossy, but I want to remember it all. Like tonight. I imagine no better birthday being with my 4 best friends only.  And Ted's here.",Lily
Happy Birthday! Here is Amanda.,Ted
And Amanda...,Lily
"Ted, you had to bring a cheesecake, but you've brought two shopping bags and a girl who knows not. My name is Marshall. Welcome. Ted talks.",Marshall
"Amanda will make a cake for Lily. She is head. We met at the restaurant last week when I returned my soup. Fortunately, she has such beautiful hair it not bother me a bit to eat.",Ted
I've nicknamed Lose hair 'at work.,Amanda
I'm really happy you make me my cake.,Lily
"In honor of the 32nd anniversary of Lily, I expected a lot of great games, beginning with... Lil-ial Pursuit. Who has the number 1?",Marshall
Me.,Amanda
"Sure. Okay, this is Amanda begins. You have 32 seconds to answer a ton of questions. And... Here we go. Lily's favorite color?",Marshall
"Well, she wears pink, so I'll say pink.",Amanda
It's Robin.,Marshall
Her favorite color is... leg.,Amanda
I think Ted whispered the word yellow. It is equally untrue.  This game is called... raising the cost of perfection.,Marshall
Pretty.,Lily
"Thank you. You wrote all that you love our queen of the day. And Lilypad, you must guess who wrote what. From his friends to his students, Lily that everyone in his life...",Marshall
Lily is a teacher. Hence the students.,Ted
"... feel loved. She makes the best cookies oatmeal raisin-, The Goonies knows by heart... ",Marshall
"Lily saw The Goonies just after his parents separated. After that, she had real problems of trust.",Ted
"And that's the strongest person I know. I can not imagine my life without her. I love you, Lily.",Marshall
Of course it was me.,Robin
Come here.,Lily
"Too cute. Lily, guess who wrote it. You look really nice.",Marshall
I would say Amanda.,Lily
"No, it was me. And I meant it.",Barney
"Well, I'm going to finish the cake.",Amanda
"Tell me if you need help.  Quick, group photo! All front of the fireplace.",Lily
"Wait, I'll find Amanda.",Ted
"No problem, it is occupied. The bother, come on.",Lily
"Wait... You do not want Amanda on the picture, right?",Ted
"Well, you know, auto focus, speed of obstruction, zoom...",Lily
"Lily, what's the matter?",Ted
Who wants a party hat? I'm a bird! All do the bird!,Marshall
Tell me the truth.,Ted
Of course not. I let another of your bitches spoil my memories.,Lily
"Lily, what are you talking?",Ted
"Ted, you always do that. You bring a girl knows that not all our evenings with us.",Lily
That's not true.,Ted
"Really? So, let us walk bitch Street Shuffle.",Lily
Or we could continue the descent on the Avenue Best Birthday.,Marshall
I Can Vote? Street bitch! Street bitch!,Barney
"My friends, I made a song for tonight. Follow me, the chorus is this: Merry, Merry Lily-anniversary...",Marshall
"Christmas morning, there was 4. Our first Christmas together, just us five. Here's another nice little game. It's called, Appoints This Bitch.",Lily
That's Pap Pa......,Ted
"False. You think the Santa Claus, because it was Christmas.",Lily
Funny. Every year my mother took tea with her friend Easter Bell. Not so funny.,Robin
"I remember, this is Sarah.",Ted
"Almost. This is Leilani. She had to come at Christmas because, you said, Folks, this may be good. And this is not the only maybe good. Eve 2007, Barney, Lily, Robin, Ted, Marshall and It's good Emily. The funeral of Uncle Cecil Robin, Marshall, Lily, Robin, Barney, Ted and... It proves that you selected the eyes closed Isabelle. My appendicitis, Robin, Marshall, Barney, Lily, Ted, and it... you've admitted, you just wanted to make. Compliance.",Lily
You remember the yoga teacher that got you into my birthday?,Barney
Thank you. You believe not just enter. Look! Look! Why not look at you! This is Slash from g*n N'Roses!,Barney
Group Photo!,Lily
"And we have had. We had a group photo with Slash on my birthday. Great, huh? Eh?",Barney
"It was there, we know the end.",Robin
False!,Barney
The funny for this photo. I plottait ass.,Robin
Oh? So do I.,Lily
And me too. He has how many hands?,Barney
Normal if it is good guitarist.,Ted
"Actually, sorry, man. I had you taken to Lily.",Marshall
Wait. Look at these pictures. Barney always has the same pose and all these years.,Robin
"Yes, at this point, I have never an old head on the photos. Neither ever or always.",Barney
It's gotta be a lousy picture of you.,Robin
"Nope, not at all.",Barney
And in elementary school? We all have school pictures ugly.,Robin
"Not the Barnacle. I always look awesome mortally. Not like Marshall, who seems to be ingeniously death.",Barney
They are not all bad. Like... this. Look. I have my eyes open.,Marshall
You really put a knot!,Barney
"A crisp, Barney?",Robin
Of course.,Barney
I! A photo ugly.,Robin
You sure?,Barney
No! Wait! You ate a potato chips! Where's the chips?,Robin
It's physically impossible for me to take a picture ugly. I know why. Ask God.,Barney
"Lily, sorry for Amanda. But I'll say. You make your spoiled rotten. You in all your statements because you think I messed up two three photos?",Ted
"These girls have ruined so many things, or you forget Paris.",Lily
This is what happened in Paris?,Robin
"In the first year of college, I studied in Paris, and I had not seen Marshall since 2 months.",Lily
2 months. And I just started making love. I was not ready to stop for 2 months.,Marshall
"And Marshall came to me to spring break. And at the last minute, Ted decided to go with the girl he had just to get back, Karen.",Lily
I'm so excited you're here.,Ted
I'm so excited to go to Paris.,Karen
I'm so excited to remake love.,Marshall
But just before takeoff...,Lily
"Wait, I must tell you something.",Karen
Really? Because I think I want to tell you the same thing.,Ted
"Do your thing is, I slept with the philosophy teacher last night? Because I do.",Karen
And so began the longest 7:30 of Marshall's life. When I went to look for...,Lily
Ted broke. I have to sleep in your room this week.Marshall will go with Ted.,Karen
2 months! My balls were blue! Blue!,Marshall
"It will not surprise you, but the rest of the trip was horrible. I did a picture of a romantic kiss in front of the Eiffel Tower, I actually had. It was just between Karen and Francis, our server yesterday.",Lily
"It's terrible. My laptop is just... fell. You me collected? Mouse, f*ck! I!",Robin
You sure?,Barney
Wait. How you do that?! You were not even standing!,Robin
"The camera loves me. Much more than that. The device I want. The unit wants to put on underwear, put an Al Green CD, dim the lights and do all the work while I was still lying with closed eyes.",Barney
"I feel sorry for Paris and group photos ruined, but... when you're single, you must hope that every girl is good. I mean, Erin.Irene.",Ted
Emily. Isabelle.,Lily
And Sarah.,Ted
Leilani! What's your problem?,Lily
"At the time, I thought each of these girls could be good, but I have to keep hoping. I have no choice.",Ted
"Here is another. More random bitch to my birthday! Hey, baby!",Lily
You have a cake rack?,Amanda
The drawer under the oven. I can not wait. You're the best!,Lily
"I'm sorry, Ted. I agree with Lily on this. This kind of evening is hard for someone new. That's why I have not brought Don. When I was in Japan, this guy, hot date for our third, took me to his brother's wedding. Now I, a complete stranger, am on the photo album of the marriage of a Japanese couple forever.",Robin
Names that bitch!,Woman
Uh...,Man
You should listen to Robin.,Lily
Because Robin is your best friend.,Ted
Right.,Lily
Your best friend on Earth.,Ted
Absolutely.,Lily
Attention Lily. It's a trap.,Marshall
"Before being your best friend, what was she? That's it. One of my random sluts.",Ted
"Yes, okay, Ted. This bitch has proved some nice, but except for bitches, not the rule of bitches.",Lily
I'm starting to cry.,Robin
"It puts an end to all this conversation about the bitches.Back to the birthday song! Barney, your part is this: She's cute She's cute.",Marshall
I bring these girls to party because you are important. You are my family.,Ted
Yes. We are a family. So why these parties can not they be us?,Lily
Like the time we celebrated the success of Marshall to the bar.,Lily
Here's the disgusting smelly hippie with whom I go out.,Ted
I did not say that!,Ted
It's as if you had done.,Lily
Here's Framboise.,Ted
You must order more food?,Marshall
No. Raspberry does not eat.,Ted
I am a vegetarian.,Raspberry
"Let us raise our glasses. During the last 3 years, Marshall has worked so hard, and I am so proud of you.",Lily
Meat is m*rder!  m*rder!,Raspberry
I confess. Raspberry was a mistake. But how would I know?,Ted
It was called Raspberry!,All
"If this is so important, Amanda is not in the picture. It does not spoil your birthday. Give him a chance.",Ted
"Look. We're all friends again! Now working on the harmonies. Merry, Merry Lily-versary! Merry, Merry Lily-versary!",Marshall
And that's it. I hope you will like.,Amanda
"Happy 42nd Birthday, Lori.",Lily
"42nd? Does the f*cking b*mb appeared to have 42 years? Or worse, she has a mind to call Lori?!",Marshall
"No, Marshall, it does not matter.",Lily
If Lily is serious. Get out of this stranger in my house!,Marshall
I'm sorry.,Amanda
Out!,Marshall
"Amanda refuses to return. She thinks you hate it. Marshall, you have to go apologize.",Ted
"You've ruined Lily's birthday and you want me to apologize? At worst, you should apologize.",Marshall
What are you talking?,Ted
"You bring her girls at our parties, and it lets them believe that things are serious. After the largues when you, you know to whom they turn? Me. I was the cleaning crew of your girlfriends for years.",Marshall
"I had just returned from a marathon to study the law library. Hi, Natalie, where is Ted?",Marshall
We broke... again! You sit with me a little while? Just sit down?,Natalie
You know what? I have not slept for 36 hours. Just a few minutes.,Marshall
"And at first I was totally sympathetic. But damn, Ted, over the years, you made me cynical.",Marshall
"I'll get us something to eat, and we'll talk about it until it is clear.",Marshall
"I just thought we had something special, you know?",Woman
"Me too. Yeah. But you know, life goes darling.",Marshall
I know if I'll get over it.,Woman
Shut up.,Marshall
"Sorry that my search for love has you so upset. You know, your precious photos might be better if I was not over.",Ted
They would be if Marshall was not on it.,Barney
Cheap sh*t. Low blow.,Marshall
You know what these pictures? A big lie. We ask. They are retouched. They are what you want but not the reality.,Ted
This is not true!,Lily
"Oh? Look at that one. Halloween, there is 2 years old. You had not played because you wanted to disguise yourself as a penguin.",Ted
"It's not that she would not, but she said that penguins are zero. Penguins.",Marshall
"And yet you're there, smiling as if nothing was wrong, completely wrong. Robin's birthday, there is 3 years old. Robin had a cold, and you made him remove his pajamas for the photo.",Ted
And you got me pinched cheeks very hard for them to be pink.,Robin
"Yeah, but you were beautiful.",Lily
And then we all ate chocolate cake in my bed.,Robin
"Actually, it was a good evening.",Marshall
It's true.,Lily
"Yeah, that was good.",Ted
Look at that one. This is the first picture of us three.,Lily
It's true.,Marshall
Do you remember what happened?,Ted
"Well, are you ready?",Man
"Wait, we take what poses? The two cops friends?",Ted
No! Why not sitcom of the 80s with two roommates who never agree?,Marshall
"Cool. Fine. One, two...",Man
"Hi, Marshall. Ready for the film?",Lily
Yeah. Just one second per cons. We are writing history. We'll take our first picture of roommate.,Marshall
And if you came to ask us?,Ted
Really?,Lily
Yeah.,Ted
"What are you doing, Ted? And if one breaks?",Marshall
And if you break it?,Ted
Come.,Marshall
I had totally forgotten that. Marshall and I were together for only a few weeks and you invited me in the photo.,Lily
I liked you.,Ted
We must bring back Amanda.,Lily
Really?,Ted
"You believed in me. It's my turn to believe in you. As far as I know, this is good.",Lily
"Thank you, Lil.",Ted
I think Lori's age made him very wise.,Robin
It is said that it was after 40 years we know each other really.,Barney
"Come on everybody, come here. Let's make a memory.",Lily
"Marshall, try this. Keep your eyes closed until the last second and when I say, open them.",Ted
It's a hole in your jacket?,Robin
What? Where?,Barney
"Now, Marshall!",Ted
Shit!,Robin
Names that bitch.,Lily
Ann has...? Anna?,Ted
"No, it was my birthday.",Lily
Your brain is too predictable associations.,Marshall
"Come on, everybody. Come here. Let's make a memory.",Lily
Is there anything in the sauce that you've made? It tastes like... coriander. And... you know that cilantro makes me...,Barney
Yes!,Robin
I love traveling.,Barney
Really? What is the best place that you hast visited?,Woman
"Hawaii is fun. A buddy of mine lives in Seattle. It's really not bad. But the best place? I must say, the moon.",Barney
You're not convinced a girl that you were the first to walk on the moon? It was seven years before you were born.,Ted
"Ted, a blonde, it's easy.",Barney
"Our ship is passed through a hole spatiotemporal or gamma rays or something. I started to rejuvenate, blah, blah, blah. So you bump into one store yoghurt. It must be insane.",Barney
"But I worked at a yogurt shop in high school. And indeed, it was... insane.",Marshall
"So, after 20 minutes, the eagle has landed. We fuse into space. Houston, we have a complainer. Other double entender related to space.",Barney
Why are you lying all the time?,Ted
"I do not lie! We made love, I have pictures!",Barney
I hate my job.,Robin
What? You had not interviewed the mayor?,Marshall
"Mayor McWouaf. It teaches the children clean, dressed dog. Finally, it is supposed to.",Robin
I do not want to talk about Mayor McWouaf. I mean those amazing shoes at Bon Pied-A-Ti! Watch as they absorb the shock!,Mayor
The table! There was a table... Back.  were returned.,Robin
Sorry Robin. I was bored.,Mike
"Yeah, I understand.",Robin
"A single interview proper, it would be nice for a change.",Robin
"Okay, I look at my calendar, see when I'm available. But I want a list of questions in advance and nothing about my private life.",Ted
"Ted, you've nabbed seven peanuts in a row. Impressive but not enough to be published.",Robin
You have nabbed seven in a row?,Marshall
seven in a row. But I speak not of it. I talk about my selection for the construction of a scale model of the Empire State Building for the greater recovery of the New York skyline in the world.,Ted
That's the thing with which you played the other day?,Robin
I was playing it. I was working.,Ted
It's you.  It's me.  I saw you in the street.  Are you Annie?  Yes. ,Ted
How long are you here?,Ted
Ten seconds.,Robin
"Yeah, just the end.",Ted
Again?,Marshall
"This is the pizza. Baby, you got the cash?",Lily
"You know, in fact, it was not me who should pay.Because I do not really like pizza.",Marshall
What!?,Lily
It was literally across the country a hundred times for a pizza.,Ted
I even caught a pizza in the shower.,Lily
"I'm not saying he loves pizza, but the last time he went, the doctor said, stop eating pizza. Marshall: Why? Doc: To you examine.  But seriously, we laugh because we love you.",Barney
"Okay, so I have no money on me... it's because... I was as*ault.",Marshall
You...?,Lily
What?,Ted
"You can pay Arthur? I have the slab! How is your father, anyway?",Marshall
Better.,Arthur
That's good.,Marshall
Did you get mugged?,Lily
Who? He wore a black hat and beard of the day? He said Hands up! ?,Barney
"Yes, because I was as*ault in 1947 at the corner of Abbott and Costello. But no. I cut through Central Park back from work.",Marshall
Watch out. Come any closer.,Man
It's good. It's good.,Marshall
It was downright terrifying.,Marshall
It was downright terrifying.,Barney
What are you doing?,Marshall
I repeat. I will say that it happened to me to lie on compassion.,Barney
It will not work. If?,Marshall
Not a bit.,Lily
I authorize you to do.,Marshall
"I do not think there's a g*n to my Marshmallow. Now, I tremble. I think I will not sleep all night.",Lily
"Oh, sweetie. I have a trick to help you sleep.  Glue this under your pillow. You'll sleep like a f*cking baby.",Robin
Robin puts it.,Ted
It's going to hurt someone. There is the... security.,Robin
"Okay, you know what? We'll all calm down. We do not need a g*n. I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life.",Marshall
I just want to forget what happened and continue to live my life. It's great. But I think I'll add a tear.,Barney
"Listen baby, I know it's scary, but look at me. I'm fine.You can put this behind us?",Marshall
It's gold! But I'd rather say 'put me behind you. ,Barney
"Baby, do not worry for me, I mean, yes, I'm a little scared, but I am New York. I will not let me change it.",Lily
I changed! I like the w*apon now. Charger.,Lily
Maybe there should be a pause..,Robin
"I said, shipper.",Lily
You wanna buy a g*n?,Marshall
"No one who scares. A tiny Beretta pink that goes with these cute sandals I just bought. In fact, our new credit card works.",Lily
"You do not need a w*apon. All studies in the world come together to say that a home is safer with no w*apon, especially ours. You know how I ever hurt you unintentionally.",Marshall
"Pretty easy, huh?  Dispatch, baby. The party will begin.  You had to disguise yourself in sexy chat!",Marshall
I have changed my mind.,Lily
"Now, you want to add a w*apon in this equation?",Marshall
"I know, you're right, but every time I close my eyes, I see this guy pointing a g*n at you. And... you're my world, Marshall. If something happened to you one day, I would...",Lily
"I know. I know. Listen, I must confess something. This attack did not go exactly as I said.",Marshall
So it was indeed a black bonnet. J'l'avais said!,Barney
He wore no black cap. It is wearing nothing at all.,Marshall
"Wait, so...",Ted
Watch out. Come any closer.,Man
It's good. It's good.,Marshall
He as*ault you naked?,Lily
I do not ask where he kept his w*apon.,Barney
We're sure it was a w*apon?,Ted
"No, guys. I came home from work on foot. Through Central Park, and I stopped at the zoo.",Marshall
Watch out. Come any closer.,Man
It's good. It's good.,Marshall
You're telling us...,Barney
What you got mugged...,Ted
For a monkey. I got mugged by a monkey.,Marshall
You've been mugged by a monkey?,Barney
"Yeah, I got mugged by a monkey. I was embarrassed, so I invented another story. The important, Lily, you do not need a w*apon.",Marshall
Forget the w*apon. It is on that now.,Lily
The monkeys attack people? It really is a jungle out.,Ted
This monkey has our address. And if it belonged to a gang?I hope he will climb to see us.,Lily
Why did not you asked the guard to recover your wallet?,Barney
Because I saw that the monkey did and I wanted more after.,Marshall
New information has been discovered on the attack on Marshall.,Barney
Really? They caught him?,Robin
He is behind bars.,Ted
"So, where did they find?",Robin
"I think naked in a tree, throwing his feces.",Lily
I've seen. That's why I take the taxi.,Robin
"You know how they caught him, huh?",Ted
They tracked.,Marshall
They tracked!,Ted
What's happening?,Robin
Okay. That's what happened.,Marshall
"No, I said. This is my story. You see, the young Marshall was at the zoo, eating a banana...",Barney
"I ate no banana! If you tell it, do it well.",Marshall
You're right. The banana was on the floor.,Barney
Was not... Was not banana banana.,Marshall
"Marshall, I'm sorry, really. Here's what happened.",Barney
Do not sh**t. There was no banana!,Marshall
"Come on, Barney. I know that Marshall has not been mugged by a monkey.",Robin
"This part is right. It is not unusual, right? Thailand, China, Costa Rica, people are attacked by monkeys all the time.They are gatherers. Because of their dynamic inter-social, have a predisposition to flight, gives them a genetic advantage.",Marshall
You've been mugged by a monkey!,Lily
It might be curious. You were wearing a yellow hat?,Ted
What? Him in your program? And my model?,Ted
No one wants to see a guy who comes to play with dolls.,Robin
"First, it was not what you think. Secondly, you got a guy playing with dolls.",Ted
"So, your dolls are favorites of Rhinebeck prices next month.",Robin
"Only if they are holding up well. Last year, I found one of her frolicking with GI Joe. This is not funny. What were you thinking? And if you were pregnant?",Men
And you invited back for a second interview.,Ted
"Because the FBI wanted to be occupied while they searched his home. Come on, Marshall. I need history. It has everything. Crime, monkeys, no stupid model of the Empire State Building, which takes me all my living room and smelly glue everywhere. Go. Do this for me... As a friend?",Robin
It would be nice to see you on TV.,Lily
Can you promise me to present it so that I am not ridiculous to myself as*ault by a monkey?,Marshall
You've been mugged by a monkey.,Lily
I've just been mugged.,Barney
What?,Ted
That's what I said to the girl at the bar just now...,Barney
It was downright terrifying. I would just like to forget what happened and continue to live my life.,Barney
My poor darling.,Woman
"Well, my name is not Neil. This is Bar...",Barney
Why you call it Neil?,Woman
The cyclist?,Woman
You've just mugged?,Woman
"Well, I can do. You see, I was on the road to the launch pad when I got mugged. And the aggressor... took my keys from the shuttle. Successful. Who wants to do something to 3?",Barney
Me too.,Woman
And it was the best thing in my life 3.,Barney
"Funny, you look like you just got two vodka and tonic in the face.",Ted
You're the lemon in your hair.,Marshall
"The story is better with my end... It's... Okay? So we were there, zero gravity. They wore helmets that astronauts...",Barney
Really? Cool.,Marshall
Who knows someone who has been mugged by a monkey?,Robin
"Nobody except the good people of Thailand, China, Costa Rica and many other countries where the crime committed by the monkeys is a common nuisance.",Marshall
"The best is that it is possible that the story goes on national TV. Guys, this story of the monkey attacker can make me famous.",Robin
"Me too. Guys, it will not. I can not do that.",Marshall
It's a little embarrassing. So what?,Ted
That's not it. Guys... I'm not as*ault by a monkey.,Marshall
"So, you've not been mugged by a monkey?",Ted
Not at all.,Marshall
So what you're saying is that you got the monkey trapped so you give him your wallet?,Barney
"No, that's not it.",Marshall
So you got the monkey attacked?,Ted
"Guys, there was no monkey! He was a man with a g*n.",Marshall
"You sure it was not a monkey on the shoulders of another monkey, wearing a trench coat?",Barney
That would be the right size.,Ted
"I just invented this story that Lily does not buy a w*apon. In truth, it never happened.",Marshall
I can not believe.,Barney
What?,Marshall
You heard me. You got attacked by a monkey. You want to go to the issuance of Robin because you're afraid of being ridiculous.,Barney
I would not?,Marshall
"If serious, this is too funny.",Barney
"Well, this has never happened. And I can lie to you because you are my best friends.",Marshall
"I, yes, but still.",Barney
But I can not lie on national TV.,Marshall
You know a long time. He told the truth?,Barney
"Ted, do not do that...",Marshall
I could not say. It smells good. But I could not say.,Ted
I still say that it happened.,Barney
"Maybe. But, Marshall, if you have not been attacked by a monkey, Robin must not speak on his show. It would be more credible.",Ted
"Journalists lie constantly. Sorry, but I believe that Jack Palance is dead when I see the body.",Barney
"It will perhaps shock you Barney, but people do not like lying to them.",Ted
"False! They like to discover that they lied. Because a lie is just a great story that has mixed with the truth. Barney Stinson. Example, that Sarah gave me this!",Barney
You mean what you done to him.,Marshall
"No, I mean what she did. In truth, I fear that history has not gone exactly as I said.",Barney
"Passed. Who wants to do something to 3?  Lisa, wait.",Barney
"Yes, Neil?",Lisa
"It's you Lisa? Sarah, wait. Listen. I'm Neil Armstrong.Sorry I lied.",Barney
"Well, I think I have not been completely honest with you either. I said I was 28, but in truth, I'm 31.",Lisa
"31 years! I was happy, very happy, thinking that because I put a 28 year old daughter who has taken too much sun. People want to lie. Marshall, they need the lie, that's why, in my case, you've been mugged by a monkey. As far as I'm done with this plan 3. I am the best in the world!",Barney
You know it.,Barney
Well done! I have too much sleep last night. Can you imagine that I almost buy a g*n? I'm glad you as*ault by a monkey.,Lily
You got me. I was just nervous. I got mugged by a monkey.,Marshall
Yeah! I knew it.,Barney
Now I think you're not really mugged by a monkey.,Ted
"Come on, Ted. Why he would invent something like that?",Barney
"Come on, Ted.",Marshall
"Come here. Seriously, what's your flavor? It's intoxicating.",Ted
"Do not be nervous. We will sit down... It's that thing, whore?",Robin
"I know. Looks like something covered by a sheet. If you want to discover, you will have to do a story on it.",Ted
It's you who will be covered by the sheet if you leave your model not stupid.,Robin
"Dude, what do you do?",Barney
"I do not think Marshall will lie on TV. And when it gives up, I wanna be there for Robin, with a story. Or rather, 102 stories, because it is the height of a building in New York.",Ted
Now I want a w*apon.,Barney
The monkey is there.,Marshall
Surprise. We thought it would help to bring you to confront your abuser.,Robin
"Because of this incident, we will send Captain Bobo in a nature reserve.",Man
I bet he will love it.,Lily
"No, ma'am. You see, we will separate him from his wife, Milly. They have been together long.",Man
The name of his companion is Milly?,Marshall
"In your own words, describe what happened.",Robin
"Well... I'd love to tell you what happened, Robin. But... I really want to know what's under that sheet.",Marshall
We talk about that. We speak your aggression.,Robin
"People are attacked every day in New York, Robin, do we often see what's under that sheet? You can sh**t it?",Marshall
We come back.,Robin
It's good.,Mike
What are you doing?,Robin
I have not really been attacked by a monkey. I invented it for that Lily buys a g*n.,Marshall
You have not been attacked by a monkey?,Lily
"What are you talking, baby? Of course I do.",Marshall
"Great, tell it to America. Five minutes.",Robin
Not five minutes. I have not been attacked by a monkey.,Marshall
It's good. I buy a g*n.,Lily
No. I got mugged.,Marshall
So Bobo goes.,Man
No! I have not been mugged!,Marshall
You know if it was attacked?,Barney
I have no idea.,Ted
"Did you or not, was attacked by Captain Bobo?",Man
Tell us just what happened.,Lily
"Yes, tell us the truth.",Robin
Okay! That is the truth. I go back... back to bed.,Marshall
"Shit. Okay, put a microphone.",Robin
Micro and makeup in place. The socks of the arch duchess.,Ted
It was not very satisfactory. When I tell that he was attacked by a monkey. And I keep the stuff of banana. It was good.,Barney
"Barney, stop lying. You can not put another end because the conclusion does not satisfy you.",Ted
"Really? Well, believe me, Mosby. One day you shall tell this story and you'll see things my way.",Barney
I doubt it.,Ted
The monkey escaped!,Mike
"Bobo, just there, Bobo.",Man
He climbs the building!,Mike
"Bobo, come here.",Man
I'll get it.,Mike
It's really happening?,Ted
"Of course, Ted.",Barney
"Ted, your mother is really a woman... really erotic boy.",Clint
Please do not.,Ted
"As a painter, slash, composer, slash, voluntary combatant with fear. I find it incredibly... sensual. But you have sex own memories of your mother, right?",Clint
"Please, stop.",Ted
"Exciting her nipple, receiving her milk. You follow me?Fine.",Clint
I can not believe I'm with this man.,Mother
"Mom, mom, it's good. You're not obliged to ask you with him. There's full of guys...",Ted
It's so cool! And he chooses!,Mother
"Yeah! Finally, I... I'm glad you're happy.",Ted
"Oh, well... because that was an ad to make you... Son.",Clint
"And if you do not boil the jars of jam, it will be a haven for bacteria.",Woman
"Oh, congratulations!",Lily
We're so happy for you!,Marshall
I feel like my 19 years. It is as if the past 35 years had never happened.,Mother
"I love to listen to you, Mom.",Ted
"Son, to show you that your mother and I will always be there for you, I want you to have this beautiful picture I have painted.",Clint
"I'm sorry, Ted.",Clint
Best...,Robin
... marriage...,Marshall
... never...,Lily
... seen.,Barney
"Hello everyone. Mahallow to be there with us. Throughout my life, well, this life. I waited a muse as Virginia. Girl... this is your song.",Clint
Oh my God.,Ted
"Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.",Barney
You're currently whining?,Barney
"I know it's stupid, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?",Robin
"Not as much as me, Robin. Guys, guys! Guess what Robin has done.",Barney
"And then I just tell you guys what Robin has done, but you were there for. I must tell you the rest of the wedding. Aunt Meredith!",Barney
"So, Ted, when you get married?",Man
You marry when?,Woman
"Robin whining during the song Clint. Oh, I've already said. The super good sister of Ted, Heather!",Barney
I gotta go.,Ted
"Wait, Ted. And your speech?",Marshall
Inventing an emergency or anything. I... I... I'll get it.,Ted
"Ted, Ted, what are you doing? It is the marriage of your mother!",Marshall
"Uncle Larry, sky gods. Niagara Falls. It is empty.",Barney
"Seriously, Ted is fine? I mean, I know that the weekend was hard, but hey... it's weird radio silence.",Lily
I know. His mother called such five times to ask where he was.,Robin
Sorry Robin. They are all out of pretzels. And I know how you're emotional.  Shh. Leave it alone.,Barney
"Okay! Okay, I... I cried during the song Clint.",Robin
She cried to the song of Clint.,Barney
"Hi, guys.",Ted
"Ted, where were you?",Lily
Is that okay?,Robin
"Oh, that's fine. I'm in top form. Go. We'll take a look!",Ted
"Hey, man, you would not possibly let someone who does not like a kind of mania old driving license?",Marshall
"Yeah, but where we're going to end?",Lily
"First, let me tell you what happened on the wedding day.",Ted
"Watching my mother to marry, I realized how I was late in relation to it on my life. I'm just going to leave here. So I walked into my hotel room and I went on a website where I go sometimes when I have trouble sleeping.",Ted
"Oh! Oh! Oh! Ted, come! Oh, my god!",All
We do not want to know what you do on the internet when you feel alone.,Lily
I have not spent... It is not that part of the night I was talking about.,Ted
"I was on my favorite site for real estate auction... Come on, we all did... visit some properties on the site.",Ted
Guys... I just bought the house of my dreams.,Ted
"What, are you saying that you bought the house?",Lily
"I mean, I put an online auction and I won the next day and I was accepted. I have just finalized all the paperwork.",Ted
"And that was fine with Blair Witch, and she tried to haggle on closing costs?",Barney
"Try not to laugh with you that, man.",Marshall
"So, I thought this piece would be the desktop. You see, a place just for dad. I mean, kids can come if they read a book, but no toy. This is not about to hold my love. It is rather a question of drawing a boundary.",Ted
Whoa.,Robin
"Ted, you're barge. It will take years and a small fortune for it to be liveable.",Lily
"I'm an architect. I would find a way. And if I start now, this is over so that my wife and I can move.",Ted
"Is it in the room with us right now, Ted?",Barney
"Okay, okay. I know. I have not found Ms. Mosby yet, but I will get it. Knock on wood.",Ted
"Look out, man.",Marshall
"Ted, you can not go on like this where you will make your life. It does not work like that.",Lily
"Yeah, I agree. This is perhaps the dumbest thing you've ever done.",Robin
The dumbest thing that ON've ever done.,Barney
"Okay, well. Ted let alone a little, right?",Marshall
Thank you.,Ted
"Okay? We all did stupid stuff in our lives. For example, I remember once when I put the rocket in the bathroom and tried to put them to dry in the microwave.",Marshall
"My God, you had to be completely stuffed.",Robin
"No, it's too dumb to whether adult. It should be child when it happened.",Barney
Children? Why...,Robin
Put rockets in...,Barney
"Oh, my God, guys! Great new game: Drunk or child? I was what? Guess.",Marshall
Bourre.,Lily
Bourre.,Robin
Gamin.,Barney
Gamin.,Ted
"Drum roll, please. I was... Drunk!",Marshall
"You know, I'm glad Robin have guessed. Because it is really sensitive and fragile. I talk about the times she cried during the song Clint. And while I whisper, I hope she hears me.",Barney
It was not me!,Robin
What?,Lily
It's not me who cried during the song Clint.,Robin
Are you crying?,Robin
"I know it's silly, but... And the dragon. They are happy, you know?",Barney
Not as much as me.,Robin
I shall spin you 500 dollars if it happened to you instead of me.,Barney
$ 500? No worries.,Robin
"Thank you, Robin. You saved me an explanation and an excruciating public humiliation. Guys! Guys! Guess what Robin has done.",Barney
"Wait, you're...",Barney
"Oh, great! I began to think that you would not come.",Ted
"Well I'm here for a while, but I think the bell does not work.",Man
Hmm.,Ted
"Oh, hey! The doorbell does not work.",Man
"Wait, wait. You will inspect the place where now?",Barney
"Well, yeah.",Ted
Hey! Hey! Hey!,All
"Okay! Well! Well, just remember that we all did stupid stuff in our lives, okay? For example, once I tried to cycle on an extension ladder to a roof of a two-story house. The only question is I was a kid or drunk? Drum roll, please.",Marshall
I was...,Marshall
Marshall is dead! Marshall died!,Mother
"A kid! Mom, are you? You always make a fuss about nothing.",Marshall
"Hey, check the porch, huh? Go. I will put a gate there.Every Sunday here, it'll be a huge party sausage.",Ted
Hmm... sausage party?,Marshall
"Burgers, burgers will be made.",Ted
"Ted, stop that. You can not keep this house. This is a huge mistake.",Lily
"Lily, listen to me. I had a plan, right? A woman, a house, children, and it turned out that the universe is really shit to what is the wife and children. So what is the thing I can control? The house I bought. It's not a huge mistake.",Ted
"Exactly. Now, I currently drive the car of my brother in the opposite direction on I-94. Now that was a big mistake. I was... a kid.",Marshall
"Wow, Barney. You've been crying about this guy or what?",Robin
"Yeah, you have leaky pipes. But on the bright side, the pond in your basement drowned rats the biggest and slowest.The others, well... They go by.",Man
"You see, you should have waited to see all the problems that home.",Lily
"You can always have problems with any decision, but you can not let that stop you. First day in college, Marshall knew he wanted to spend his life with you. And if someone was there to contradict his decision?",Ted
"I know this is our second hot date but, Lily Aldrin, I will marry you.",Marshall
"Not so fast.  was some form of problem here. These hips are not suitable for a baby Eriksen.And that thing she does not have the right filter. This is a maintenance problem that never leave. And I know you think like this gothic look now. But basically, you've always imagined with a Spanish style? I would recommend you take a look at the options in the lease.",Man
"But Marshall took the risk, and that's the best thing that ever happened to you both.",Ted
"It was Robin! What! Yes, it was Robin who cried at the song Clint! But she said... I know what she said. But that's not what she wanted you to know.",Barney
"Look, Barney, I support most all these jokes about me crying. And if I claim to prove it was you who was crying, that you would not be a problem?",Robin
Of course.,Barney
"I made a mistake in letting you go, right? Your penis is huge.",Robin
"Boy, you've almost had us still.",Lily
You're always a little too far.,Marshall
Shit.,Barney
"Well, good news. I think we all will soon be out of here.",Man
Really?,Ted
"Yes, I ended up downstairs and outside. Now, I could continue to look and see what I could do except black mold, bearing walls damaged, frayed electrical son, lead paint, water damage, fire damage, sun damage, off the cares, the floor is rotting... Oh, look at that, not termites. The chimney cracked, bats, rats, spiders, raccoons, the tramp, the gutter parts, the old fuse box, paint the kitchen which is not bad, but really swear the plates with the plans working. Or I could advise you not to buy this miserable house Guantanamo Bay, and suggest you break all by before a wind blowing through all son of bitches from here.",Man
And if I had already bought the son of a bitch?,Ted
I'll see at the top if all goes well.,Man
He said he had found a tramp?,Marshall
"Ok, yes. There are problems. But I see this house as I know it can be. I see a swing on the tree outside. I see a crown on the front door at Christmas. I see a barbecue outside on the patio or I would make Barbec every weekend. I see a life I know I can be here.",Ted
I see a complaint.,Barney
Found termites.,Man
"Hey, good, good news is that the inspector has k*ll some cockroaches at the time of impact.",Robin
"Oh, stay there. Huge hole on the second floor. I just want to be sure the report is accurate.",Lily
"You were right. It was a huge mistake. It's just that... the world is changing, but me... You have a flat 'for years. It's getting serious between Robin and Don. Barney, perhaps this is a new tie?",Ted
Thank you. My God.,Barney
Now my mother remarried. I... I'm exactly the same spot 5 years ago. I'm tired. I'm... I'm ready for life that goes with this house.,Ted
"OK, buddy. Sometimes people make bad decisions in life. Like your mother.",Barney
What do you mean?,Ted
"Ted, as you know, I've always been really, really addicted to your mother.",Barney
"Please, stop.",Ted
"Actually, Virginia and I spent a special time in 2006.Before Clint.",Barney
What are you talking about?,Ted
I wanted to be your father!,Barney
What does that mean?,Ted
"Do not answer me, young man. That's why I cried at the song of Clint. Because that bastard stole your mother. And now all that remains for me... is the memory of the drop at the airport.",Barney
And that's how you got the pin? Incredible. You... So... here we go.,Barney
Here we go.,Virginia
It is a good time. Not much traffic...,Barney
"Oh, I love this song.",Virginia
Is it true? Hmm. I can... Listen... Ted's mother. I... I should really...,Barney
Your penis is huge.,Virginia
Again?! One too many!,Marshall
"Okay, that's good. Well, I invented the last, but everything else, I swear it was true. Come on, man. Your mother is a cougar.",Barney
"Wait, I thought you said that a cougar could not be more than 50 years.",Robin
"Okay, this is a Mellencamp.",Barney
"Guys, I'm in trouble. I mean, the best I can do is to improve the house and sell the property with great losses.",Ted
"Listen, Ted... Usually in life, when you make a huge mistake, you must learn to live with. But how many times you got the chance to take a mass break out and all?",Lily
It's silly.,Ted
Your mother and I were at second base.,Barney
Thank you Lily. It was fantastic.,Ted
"A Ted Mosby, owner, friends, and if he can rent it, Slumlord.",Lily
There... there is one last thing I should do.,Ted
It was our turn.,Robin
Hi.,Ted
"Ted, what are you doing here?",Virginia
"I have not been able to make your speech. I was selfish and I freaked out and I'm so sorry, so... and here... A hand sign for the Dj? Dee made the sign... I pass. Mom, I love you, and I've never seen him so happy with Clint. And Clint, welcome in the family... what you both is what I'd really like to have someday. But in the meantime, health to you both. I love you. ",Ted
"Ted... I'm so there... cooked. I'm 60% sure only that you're there before me. But if you're here, I love you. And you're the best son a mother could have.",Virginia
Hey.,Ted
"Hey, man.",Marshall
How did you know that I would be here today?,Ted
Robin told me. Happy Housewarming!,Marshall
But I told you the last time I saw you I was coming home.,Ted
"I know what you said. I also know my best friend, Ted Mosby. Listen... for all time, all the years I have told you... Slow! Not go too fast with this girl! You've not heard a single f*cking time. Your heart is both drunk and child.",Marshall
"Please stay here with me, man.",Ted
That's what I do.,Marshall
I can... I can give you some ideas I have?,Ted
Yeah.,Marshall
You want to install?,Don
"Well... it's a bit early... but... of course, I might consider... I moved here, let me think.",Robin
"I mean, you can install yourself beyond me to sit?",Don
"Yeah, that's what I was talking about me too. As I said, let me think. I agree.",Robin
But... now that you've mentioned... you wanna install?,Don
You said what?,Lily
I thought about it.,Robin
"You think about it? You hardly know him. In addition, the guy is a draw with a job that is worthless.",Barney
"We have the same job, Barney.",Robin
"And we could not be more proud of you, my angel.",Barney
It still seems fast.,Lily
You're probably right.,Robin
You should live with him.,Ted
Really?,Robin
"Yeah, you're happy with him, and i adore you as a roommate, I want you to do what is right for you.",Ted
You wanna throw me out because of something with milk?,Robin
It's super boring.,Ted
Robin?!,Ted
No. I have a system. I put the empty brick in the fridge to remind us to buy milk.,Robin
Why not let the solid brick to remind us not to buy?,Ted
"All right. As a former... before you embark on anything, I'm meeting this guy. I think it's pretty weird not having yet met.",Barney
"Bluntly. It's as if someone was orchestrating things for this specific purpose. Okay, but you must promise to behave well.",Robin
I promise.,Barney
"I'm doing this contortionist Portuguese, and I swear... it is so flexible, at a time, it was about me and beneath me. A top and a bottom! One and two! Which is empty?",Barney
It's good.,Don
And it was Barney.,Robin
It's not bad.,Don
"Actually, I'm not sure.",Ted
I think it's great. But I pity any woman with self-esteem so low it would go out with him.,Don
"I appreciate you, Don. Both, we love a good scotch, one likes my stories compelling. And we went out with Robin.",Barney
So Barney's your ex and you hang out with him? It makes me uncomfortable.,Don
"The'm not, it's as if we had never been together.",Robin
"In short, the arms of the Erasmus student have dropped and there fell of my swing. Seriously, I have not found a girl who can do that from Robin.",Barney
"How was your weekend, or any other topic?",Robin
Atrocious.,Lily
Terrible.,Marshall
Twin beds? I can not sleep in separate beds. We should complain.,Lily
"Yeah, you're right, I'll ask for another room.",Marshall
"Yeah, I'll go with you in just a second......",Lily
Maid!,Voice
You can come back later? It takes a nap.,Marshall
It's time to return the keys.,Voice
We spent 18 hours.,Marshall
We missed the full board.,Lily
I lost 5 kg.,Marshall
It's not weird that Robin is still friends with Barney?,Don
It's odd that we all still be friends with Barney.,Ted
I do not know how to react to the fact that she hangs out with an ex.,Don
"Trainer with an ex okay, two at a pinch. Shit, two is even better. Because strawberry...",Ted
But if you had someone and he hung out with an ex...,Don
"Wait, sorry. It? ",Ted
He was friends with his ex.,Don
"Wait, wait. You think I'm gay? Why you would assume that?",Ted
Your teacher of calligraphy called...,Robin
And?,Ted
Your ink arrived.,Robin
Yes.,Ted
"When I found out that your roommate is single, I was a little jealous, but now that I know he's gay, so good.",Don
Ted is not...,Robin
But we still house boudoirs and hot dogs.,Ted
Thank you. Ted is not it?,Don
Ted will not be much there. It follows Cher's tour.,Robin
"Think again, Cher made some great concerts. But I'm not gay.",Ted
"Lily, be honest. It's not weird that Robin train with an ex?",Don
Ted and Robin broke up there for years. This is not a problem.,Lily
Ted? And Robin?,Don
"I'm so gay, eh, Donnie?",Ted
An apple martini for gentleman.,Bartender
Thank you.,Ted
"You're also out with Ted? 4 people you consider your best friends, you've slept with 50% of them.",Don
It's just my friends.,Robin
But they are also your ex. And you live with one of them.I'm sorry. I have to think about all that.,Don
It should have separate beds.,Lily
"Yes, a mini fridge. And separate beds.",Marshall
a deal!,Lily
I came to apologize to you. I exaggerated.,Don
"Well, there you should also apologize. We said some pretty hurtful.",Barney
Not at all.,Don
That was after you to be part.,Barney
Sorry for not having told the truth from the beginning.,Robin
"I acts as a hysteric. It's not offensive, right?",Don
Still not gay.,Ted
"Sorry, I meant you're both important to Robin. How about dinner tomorrow night at home.",Don
It's great.,Ted
"I can not wait, buddy.",Barney
Thank you.,Robin
You're welcome.,Don
"So long, guys.",Robin
I have to get Robin.,Barney
Are you kidding?,Ted
"I do not know what it is, but I want to get Robin.",Barney
I know what it is. You're like... a kid who threw his toys and wants them back as soon as another plays with.,Ted
I had perhaps not done playing with. I just left to play with something else for a while.,Barney
You ready.,Ted
Ready for what?,Barney
To read the letter.,Ted
"Dear Ted future, never returns with Karen, because it is a pretentious snob. And she has deceived you. Sorry that you discover the way. You see? We laugh now.",Ted
"Dear Ted future, stay away from Natalie. And girls who b*at you to the ground for no reason, before a cheering crowd. PS... Check out a shrink to find out why it has you a little excited.",Ted
"Dear genius relations, Stella has left you at the altar, you'll love me maybe more. And you will surely die alone. It's not so sad written in calligraphy.",Ted
Hanging out with Robin was a huge mistake.,Barney
Write it.,Ted
What?,Barney
Write yourself a letter. That way you will remember the reasons for the break when you miss.,Ted
My pleasure. Dear Barney... the future... This ink is too cool.,Barney
Right?,Ted
You... and Robin...,Barney
"... a couple were atrocious. It did not work. You always love Robin, but remember the other women... And above all, the other breast, and all the cool stuff you do with breasts... Y to the head, juggle... squeaker squeaker... I'm a hopeless romantic.And there are drawings of breasts.",Barney
Get it?,Ted
I understand. I really want it back.,Barney
"Humans are not made to share a bed. Sex and sleep are associated, but these are two different things.",Marshall
"I know. I love you, but I want this new bed is a sanctuary of my sleep and my sleep only.",Lily
"Me too. And snacks, but that's all. You know what we should do? Buy a third bed to make love.",Marshall
A bed for sex. For hot sex and bestiality.,Lily
"Awesome. That way, each bed will have its uses.",Marshall
"Right. There will be two beds for sleeping, one for sex, and I thought an ottoman for birthdays.",Lily
"Baby, you come to revolutionize modern marriage?",Marshall
And how.,Lily
Do you like sushi?,Don
"Don made sushi, it's cool, huh? He learned in Japan.",Robin
It's too easy.,Barney
"Be nice. You want it just because you can not have it. Like saying Sit wherever you want, except on that chair. You will be so...",Ted
My chair!,Barney
From spicy tuna? My favorite.,Lily
"I do too. It is more spicy, the better.",Don
"Me too, man. More than you, certainly. Instance. Super spicy. I feel bad.",Barney
You will not believe. Don also has twin beds.,Marshall
We just had.,Lily
Great. Super.,Don
Wait. This super does not look great.,Lily
My ex and I thought it would be a good idea but they separated.,Don
But I bet you have no special bed sex.,Marshall
"It yes, with his personal trainer.",Don
This pepper is an ice cube in my mouth.,Barney
"But if Robin decides to move, I bought a giant bed.",Don
I would love. If I move.,Robin
If you moved in.,Don
Don Tokyo... You ever do that... in Japan? Wasabi!,Barney
Great! Give her milk!,Ted
"spit, spit!",Robin
"We have more milk. Thank you for the reminder, Robin.",Don
"Well, I hope you're happy.",Ted
I stay on my position. It was bold and romantic.,Barney
You were emptied from the top and bottom.,Ted
Come on. Did you do stupid stuff to impress Robin.,Barney
"Yes, but not anymore, because I turned the page. Just like you.",Ted
"You have not turned the page. You want it as much as me, but you not admit it.",Barney
That's ridiculous and I'll tell you why.,Ted
For my biographer?,Barney
"Concentrate on the letter, ok? At Ted, Robin is the ideal girl for you, but she will not engage. You need someone who wants to settle. So, until Robin is ready for this, it is not for you. I still remember stealing the blue French horn, our first kiss, her eyes when she told me she loved me. And shit. I want it back.",Ted
I stole a blue french horn for her... I was with her for a year.I wanted her to be the mother of my children and spend eternity in his arms.,Ted
"... I want to sleep with her, at least one last time. She is mine!",Barney
"It's not for you! And it's not mine, either. It is... to Don.",Ted
"Okay. We must get rid of him. You know, metaphorically.",Barney
Of course.,Ted
"Or... literally. That's how it starts! I'm afraid, Teddy!",Barney
We all talk!,Ted
I'm worried. I do not want that divorce.,Lily
"This is Don. It's not us. Our new way to sleep is only going to get closer. Now, get out of my bed.",Marshall
We can at least get closer?,Lily
"Sure. You spoke of the beds. No, I'm not.",Marshall
Why?,Lily
"I love you more than anything, but you're worse than a kettle. I'm surprised that your pee breaks are not as steam.",Marshall
You're not perfect either. Between the food and ants. But... I still want to be with you.,Lily
"To hit me and slam me all night? I swear, as soon as you fall asleep, it looks like it push you arms. One would think sleeping with an Indian goddess.",Marshall
We're getting closer?,Lily
You speak of beds yet?,Marshall
Nope.,Lily
Come here.,Marshall
Robin Stinson!,Barney
Robin Mosby!,Ted
Robin Stinson!,Barney
Ted Scherbatsky. I would take his name. I do not care.,Ted
"Okay, wait. What do you say to that? It is being shared?I take up to 40 years and after you can have it.",Barney
Who we laugh? It is with Don. We must accept it and move on.,Ted
You're right. I go to you... I go to the bathroom. And then I'll break...,Barney
It's BarnExclussif.,Barney
"BarnExclussif, not quit. I have a double appeal.",Robin
It's Teddy Bear. Want some honey?,Ted
"No. Ted, not quit. I'll remember. Ted is on the other line... and I think he has a problem.",Robin
"Ted calls you? Indeed, he has a problem.",Barney
What's the matter?,Robin
There's that you have beautiful hair. Front and back.,Ted
We almost lose control.,Ted
It's true. I'm going to leave before something regrettable.,Barney
"Robin, I love you!",Barney
Species of bastard! I brought the blue French horn!,Ted
"I brought the blue French horn! Ted has just given me.Sorry, I was there before you.",Barney
I want you back!,Ted
"Come on, get.",Don
"All right! Here we go! You, Me and Ted!",Barney
Something to three.,Ted
"Robin and I have to go to work. Sit down watching TV and will be discussed when we come back, okay?",Don
"You abandoned easily. Game, set and match!",Ted
We won the fingers in the nose...,Barney
Where's this great TV?,Ted
Right there.,Don
Thank you.,Robin
"You're welcome. Good night, guys.",Don
"Good night, Dad.",Barney
"It was good. Well, you gotta go.",Marshall
What?,Lily
"I'm sorry. It was great and you're great. But, I must get up early, so...",Marshall
You throw me like that?,Lily
You knew before you start.  Wait. Forget your sweater. Nice try.,Marshall
"The Teddy Bear, BarnExclussif.",Robin
Dad?,Barney
"We get up, f*ck. You remember last night?",Robin
"Damn, Ted was torn. Embarrassing...",Barney
"I'm sorry. It is both. We drank and we were stupid, but... We will do everything we can to ensure that Don is part of the group.",Ted
"Don will not be part of the group. Neither do I. At least for a while. Guys... with Don, it works well. I want to see where it goes. And I could not do it if I continue to hang out with my ex. It will not. I moved in with Don.",Robin
So what's going on with Robin?,Barney
"You were right, she was just angry. It's been four days and not talk to relocate. We must never repeat this kind of shit.",Ted
"I agree. In fact... I even wrote another letter. Dear Barney the future, you think you want to get Robin, thou wilt not true. Let her. Sincerely, Barney's past.",Barney
Let me see!,Ted
Give me that.,Barney
"Ps... The top was for Ted. He believed? Fine. Pull yourself together with Robin, but say nothing to Ted because he will still go wrong. And there are still drawings of breasts.",Ted
"In my defense, the breasts, is not it great?",Barney
Too great.,Ted
Robin?!,Ted
Guess what I have behind my back.,Barney
"Wait, wait. I will find. Left.",Lily
Not a good game but okay. Five tickets well placed to Robots vs. Wrestlers.,Barney
Robots vs. Wrestlers?,Marshall
Great!,Ted
You know Robots vs. Wrestlers?,Barney
No.,Marshall
But we think some kind of sport in which robots wrestlers.,Ted
"That's exactly it, according to the website!",Barney
"Wait, wait. Who is the fifth ticket?",Lily
"Uh... Robin. I know... She lives with her boyfriend and she said not wanting to hang out with us, but it's Robots vs. Wrestlers. Robots vs.... Wrestlers!",Barney
Barney is right. It is impossible to deny that.,Marshall
"I assume you're talking about cooking, otherwise I would have other issues.",Lily
"I'm sorry, Lily, but I have a chance to Don. And I will not drink out with you every night... especially when you included two of my ex.",Robin
I understand. You're right. We miss you much.,Lily
"You too. I gotta go. It is called?  Sorry, New York, I had to answer. Where were we? Bus accident.",Robin
She said no? How could she? Robots vs. Wrestlers of our tradition is the largest group.,Barney
Tradition? It was never done.,Lily
"It's Robots vs. Wrestlers, Lily. This is obviously a tradition. It starts like this. First, Robin moves in with Don and Marshall and Lily have a baby, then Ted...",Barney
Goes?,Ted
"I was going to say was found eaten by her cats, but it's not good either. Everybody leaves me, and I like it!",Barney
Do not worry about a baby on our side. It is not yet started.,Lily
Absolutely. A small road.,Marshall
A small long road.,Lily
But you can see.,Marshall
"Very, very far.",Lily
But you can see the exit sign.,Marshall
Oh? I see it.,Lily
You should put yourself on track.,Marshall
"I understand how you feel. It is important friendship. In this regard, Emerson wrote a great poem, titled Friendship. You'll love it. A drop of crimson bl*od carries more weight than the waves of the sea...",Ted
"You must try this Syrah. A taste of creme de cassis, red berries, oak heated...  letter in September, baritone white. Of course! A lyric baritone! Which is higher than a bass-baritone.There is a key moment in the second act of La Boheme...",Ted
"I try to add some class to our meetings. It's like this quote from Dante's Inferno. Consider the race of which you are created not to live like brutes but to follow virtue and knowledge.Or, in Italian original...",Ted
You're right. I exaggerate with this story of Robin. What is an announcement? Wife Robin Don. I'll die alone! Ted eventually eaten by her cats!,Barney
Relax... It's for Marissa Heller.,Ted
"Marissa Heller? She looks good. Face, breasts, describe. Begins with the breasts.",Barney
"Ted! It was our first post! It is popular. It was... a golf magazine for... Marissa Heller. A catalog of wicker furniture, also Marissa Heller. And a voucher for a bird shop... addressed to Marissa Heller... or check it out... Current Resident. It's us! It has mail!",Marshall
Fantastic! That must be the previous tenant. I wonder how it looks.,Ted
"And since, in every mail we receive, the picture becomes clearer. But we know not how it looks. I will follow it as always...",Ted
Open it.,Lily
"An invitation to the annual Spring Jefferson Van Smoot, for Saturday night... in his apartment in Alberta! Friends... This is the most beautiful building in Manhattan! We gotta go!",Ted
"It depends, on the invitation, it's about robots fighting wrestlers to rule the galaxy?",Marshall
It's about an open bar.,Ted
We change the plan for Saturday. Evening Marissa Heller for alcohol and Robots vs. Wrestlers. But one of us should pretend to Marissa Heller.,Barney
I'm flattered but Lily should.,Marshall
This building is fabulous! You saw the gate and terracotta panels outside?,Ted
I just got a text from Robin. It says...,Lily
"Guys, we get together. Lil, you can do... All you have to watch the guy in front, say your name is Marissa Heller, and it passes. And I repeat, to be sure, no accent.",Barney
"It is certain that it is not English, though? Okay! I do. I go there.  Sorry. Go ahead.",Lily
I come for the reception of Mr. Van Smoot. I'm Marissa Heller.,Woman
Damn it then!,Lily
That's Marissa Heller. She is pretty.,Ted
She has beautiful teeth. It should not need the reminder cards to go to the dentist.,Marshall
What do we do?,Lily
"I do we go to the party, that's what!  We met at the meeting of ornithophilic.",Barney
I do not believe.,Marissa
Lovers of wicker?,Barney
No.,Marissa
"I'm on it. This lift uses the same mechanism from its installation in 1906. It seems that Lamar Louis Skolnick, the architect of the building, has cut the panels himself.",Ted
A fan of Skolnick? I love the juxtaposition between the German Renaissance outside...,Marissa
"And some French influence inside! He was an architect with a poet's soul, really.",Ted
"I must make a confession. It is not on the list, but I always wanted to see the inside of Alberta.",Ted
"So, this way. We are together.",Marissa
I said I'd get us.,Barney
So... nobody saw The Young and the Restless?,Lily
"Great! Who commissioned illustrated soap? Marissa Heller, I like your style.",Lily
No one? Do I understand that there is not one fan of soap in this elevator?,Lily
I have no television. The only opera I see are at the Met.,Marissa
Prem's.,Ted
"I'm sorry. Jefferson, my dear.",Marissa
I'm not dressed for it.,Marshall
In a coined word asshole-Apocalypse.,Barney
"This is Peter Bogdanovich, talking to Arianna Huffington and Will Shortz, crossword editors of The New York Times! Try at least, Chow and alcohol free. 20 minutes and off we go.",Ted
"But, the music changed, and Glovanni Artusi, simply do not understand the new way of composing.",Man
"Sorry, you talk about the fourth book of madrigals?",Ted
"Dear boy, what else?",Man
This is my favorite book of madrigals.,Ted
smoked foie gras with mango and caramel cream?,Server
You have nothing that resembles a mini cheeseburger?,Marshall
"I do not think, sir.",Server
Mini pizzas? French fries? Something that makes me think I'm a giant?,Marshall
"I look, sir.",Server
He will watch it.,Marshall
This morning I made the heart of the Ambassador of the Netherlands. I hope he gets better.,Barney
Really? A colleague of mine was prescribed Coumadin. And it is impossible it should be anticoagulated and if she had surgery.,Woman
"You know who published an article on great Walt Whitman, and political semantics? Professor Hammersmith Oxford.",Ted
I'm the teacher Hammersmith.,Woman
That's exactly what Truffaut spoke in his 1954 article in Cahiers du Cinema. Cinema is the substance of the filmmaker.,Man
"As Undersecretary of Finance, I had a great influence on this legislation. Now, I wonder if you will accompany me in the map room to stimulate my package.",Barney
"I do not think, my dear. You're too old for me.",Woman
"Zsa Zsa Gabor is still sexy, but other than that, it is rotten this holiday.",Barney
"We tried, it's been 20 minutes. We are going. Where is Ted?",Lily
"I know how to find it. Just a second...  gongs, eh? Stronger than we think.",Marshall
"Boy, this gong is a relic of 500 years that has not been hit since WS Gilbert at the premiere of The Mikado in London in 1885.",Man
It is the relic of his wife 500 years that has not been hit since WS Gilbert at the premiere of The Mikado in London in 1885.,Marshall
"Friends, Will Shortz, editors of the Times crossword. You know, I always say they use Ulee of Gold Life for vowels? Tell them.",Ted
Can I talk for a second?,Marshall
"Ten letters, a diminutive egg pie?",Ted
Mini quiche? Where?,Will
There. A great reception.,Ted
Grave. We are going. It's time for Robots vs. Wrestlers.,Marshall
Ted. There you are. We will soon make blind-tests of white wine. It will surely be great.,Marissa
"I missed that glitch. I know, do not bother to say. There's no glitch in the wine.",Ted
Miss Lily in the living room with the chancellor.,Lily
"Great God, no! They belonged to Edgar Allan Poe!",Man
Sorry!,Lily
"Look, I'm having fun here, so I'll pass Robots vs. Wrestlers.",Ted
"But you never missed Robots vs. Wrestlers. It happens that way. First Robin us loose, and now you? And for those pretentious snobs and old game?",Barney
"Actually, I like those pretentious snobs and they are not old fashioned fart noise when I open my mouth. I remain. See you tomorrow.",Ted
It's an evening.,Barney
It means nothing.,Lily
"It means everything. If you come not to Robots vs. Wrestlers, it's the end of our friendship.",Barney
See you tomorrow.,Ted
"All right. So you do most of our group, forever. You can ask to return in 2 years. Come see wrestlers fight like robots. I'm embarrassed. I forgot something.",Barney
Where did your buddies?,Man
"You know, a reading of poetry.",Ted
The best tradition of all time!,Marshall
"You crazy not me, Marshall. Let's be honest. The group is finite. Ted is gone, like Robin. That separates us as well.",Barney
"Boy, Barney, stop with your abandonment issues. Ted has the right to have a life outside the group. As we all.",Lily
"Wait. Why do you say that all of a sudden? My God, you're pregnant!",Barney
No.,Lily
"My God, have you ever had the baby! It is just behind me, huh?",Barney
"No, silly. One day we all move forward in our lives. It's called growing up.",Lily
"That's all you got, f*g?",Robot
You can at least promise to not get pregnant within a year?,Barney
I can not.,Lily
You can not?,Barney
You can not?,Marshall
"Citrus and honeycomb with a sharp acidity. This is a Sauvignon Blanc, Loire Valley. The town of Sancerre.",Ted
"Okay, again! Bravo, my boy!",Man
No! You can not have children! You want to raise a child in this crazy world.,Barney
The world is pretty cool right now.,Marshall
"Okay, Lily, I have no choice. If you have a daughter, day, no, the minute she is 18... Gong!",Barney
Babies.,Marshall
I hope Ted is unhappy.,Barney
"Ted, you are a remarkable lyric baritone.",Will
"Thank you, Will Shortz.",Ted
"Okay, you can have a baby, but only under the following conditions: 1-You promise to always love me more than the baby, 2-Once a month, I can use to shake the baby, 3 - It may include a drop baby from the first floor and that saves me; 4-No breastfeeding in front of me. Forget the five-four, get out your breasts when you want.",Barney
Holy shit!,Marshall
I can not believe!,Lily
"Of course, hell is an interesting concept, is not it? I always liked to imagine it as Dante's Divine Comedy. If I may. Italian original...  I do not believe it. I recite the Divine Comedy in Italian original, and nobody makes fart noises. It's weird. I've never gone that far. I just seem to be an assh*le. My God, I control myself! Listen to me, I am completely let go! I'm the biggest assh*le on the planet. I wish someone stops me.",Ted
I gotta run.,Ted
"Rule number 83. If something out of the baby ends up on my costume, I can touch the breasts of Lily.",Barney
"Dude, what's your thing with the breasts of my woman tonight?",Marshall
It is not I who make the rules.,Barney
Do you really think about all this?,Marshall
I know. Maybe not.,Lily
"For what it's worth, I think we are ready. We love, we are financially stable, and frankly, it would change that much the way we live.",Marshall
"If being at home with a baby, tonight we have never seen a dead ringer for Ted. It would make you what, if we had missed it?",Lily
I blame the boy for the rest of his life.,Marshall
"Right, for his daughter's life.",Lily
You're right. No need to rush.,Marshall
"What do you say that? We agree that it makes no sense to have a child before he saw the five doubles, right?",Lily
"Sure, it goes without saying.",Marshall
"So when we finally see a dead ringer for Barney, this is the message of the universe to tell us to do. And at that time, we'll try. Deal?",Lily
Deal.,Marshall
"Look who thinks he can come here and repeat the group. Well, you can forget. Pity, remake the group! I want to lose anyone yet! We're sorry. You can recite all the poems of assh*le that you want, we never say anything bad on it, I promise.",Barney
Really? Because there is a poem I would recite... Friendship of Ralph Waldo Emerson. A drop of crimson bl*od carries more weight than the waves of the sea The world uncertain comes and goes...,Ted
"Sorry, someone had to. I pay my tour.",Robin
"Good night. Thank you very much, I enjoyed myself so much. Willem Defoe...!",Man
"That's my ex, sorry. We try to remain friends. Hello, my chick! You have tickets to Maui?",Woman
Anyway... We were happy together.,Ted
What...,Lily
That's it. This is the problem.,Ted
Her ass?,Barney
Big?,Marshall
Small?,Lily
This is an access problem?,Robin
"There will always be a bag. Even if it goes well, it ends one day by spoiling.",Ted
Once in 30 years.,Barney
"When I discover his luggage. I feel it. I do not know what it is, but when I know, it'll be over.",Ted
"Please, tell me you repliest not emotional baggage.",Barney
It's a good thing?,Ted
The emotional baggage is the foundation of American cultural export the most important.,Barney
The p*rn.,All
"Actually, the p*rn. Only women with major baggage make p*rn.",Barney
Everyone has one. You should know the face.,Robin
"Really? The last time I overcame a background, it was that of a certain Stella, and, damn, I draw a blank. How did it end?",Ted
"What happened is horrible, it does not mean that is the case for everyone.",Lily
"Content that will be encountered young, not to be.",Marshall
Issues mother.,Lily
Not at all.,Marshall
From grandmother.,Ted
Certainly not.,Marshall
On the great grandmother.,Barney
I do not like it myself cuddly.,Marshall
And you know your worst baggage? You're too nice.,Robin
It's not a nice bag?,Marshall
You've already looked walking down the street?,Robin
I know not what to answer.,Marshall
I'll help.,Robin
"I'll help you.  That should do it. Guys, not today. It would be... ",Marshall
It's normal.,Marshall
There is a street where it's normal. One clue: a giant yellow bird lives on.,Barney
I would love that one bag of Royce or she is nice.,Ted
"Gentile? This is the worst baggage. The best: she hates her father, and she believes to be big, but no. Steamy sex at first date, and have brekky, she left. Why are you with me?",Barney
Spaghetti is your specialty?,Royce
It does not b*at my pancakes. I'll make once. There are incredible.,Ted
"My father made me pancakes complete... Thanks to him, I worked in p*rn. You know? Parents Offering Recognition, Nutrition and Order? A charity for teens who do not have access to sport or healthy food. Reminds me... I k*ll my brother... with this joke last night. A barber, a stripper and a pediatric psychiatrist..., walk into a bar.",Royce
"What took you so, one time!",Robin
It's nothing. Forget.,Marshall
It was on his way and Marshall wanted to stop to help guys to load their van.,Lily
To be nice. It cost nothing.,Marshall
"And when the van is gone, which shows up if it is not the owner of the apartment, which had just been robbed help. And that was hard to explain to the police.",Lily
"That's what I meant. New York is not a small town, friendly, crime-free, inbred, in the woods, with cows lost in Minnesota, where you've grown.",Robin
"No crime? In 1994, the cashier of the grocery store was robbed. Besides, I like being friendly, okay? I will change not it.",Marshall
"Do not change, baby. I find it pure. Pure.  Mashed mother of God is a moron sometimes. He lent them money to refuel.",Lily
He gave them money?,Robin
"Not given, lent. They said they would send a check, so Marshall gave our address. What prevents them from coming home one night, and maybe tie me? With Marshall, sometimes we pretend for real but it's terrifying.",Lily
Why would you tell her anything?,Robin
"What interest? He's from Minnesota. The mascot of his high school, it was a hug. Marshall is back with a beer while Ted joined them in turn.",Lily
What was with Royce?,Robin
Interesting. We went to this new film The Future Bride.,Ted
"Was it good?! Not that I'm interested. This is for girls.But it could take me there, like, 7:10 p.m. at the session tomorrow, 9:40 p.m. where because of my meeting. But I will leave soon, we will try to 7:10 p.m..",Marshall
"What's the movie about, anyway?",Robin
This is where it's interesting.,Ted
"Big sucks, I'm Jed Mosley! I am the architect's most powerful and corrupt New York. I want...  It's gonna leave a job!",Man
It's about me.,Ted
The Future Bride talking about you?,Lily
"You sure it's you? When I saw The Wild History of space, I would have sworn...",Marshall
This is my story. It is written by Tony Grafanello.,Ted
Tony Grafanello? This is...,Robin
With him that Stella is gone. This film tells the story of our breakup.,Ted
"Why would he make a film? It's not him, the villain?",Robin
"Yes, nice and called Ted Mosby.",Lily
"It's funny, it's also my recollection. But according to the film...",Ted
"Mr. Mosley, your fiancee is here.",Voices
"We had to go taste the wedding cakes, remember?",Stella
"Bluntly not, doll.",Jed
I'm stunned.,Marshall
Right?,Ted
That's comedies these days? I fall off my chair! I really fell off my chair. It was funny.,Marshall
What idiot. He chose a beautiful girl for my role?,Robin
You're not in it.,Ted
What a jerk!,Robin
"No, Tony is not stupid. Well, not after the movie.",Ted
"I'm getting married. Sorry, Tony.",Stella
"Stella, your happiness is all that matters to me, except his poor children I care volunteer.",Tony
I love it.,Royce
"It's not so easy. Jed Mosley is perhaps not as beautiful as you, or as big...",Stella
I'm bigger than him.,Ted
And sex is horrible. Once he fell asleep in the middle.,Stella
Once. I was on medication!,Ted
What?,Royce
Nothing.,Ted
"This movie is really rotten! And everything is wrong!Remember my request? This spontaneous moment in the game room, I had no ring, so I gave him a teddy?",Ted
It was cute.,Lily
And romantic.,Marshall
A little cutesy.,Robin
That's how it was in the movie...,Ted
"If it makes you shut up, I think we can get married.",Jed
You do not give me the ring?,Stella
"Bluntly not, doll. You pass it the finger.",Jed
And the hot date 2 minutes? When I condensed a romantic rendezvous in 2 minutes to go with the busy schedule of Stella?,Ted
You're a good guy.,Lily
It was really nice.,Marshall
And a little cutesy.,Robin
According to the film...,Ted
And our romantic weekend?,Stella
"Bluntly not, doll. Can I suggest a date of 2 minutes, if you know what I mean. Naked!",Jed
"If you know what you do, 2 minutes.",Marshall
Word expert.,Lily
But the worst... the worst... it was the end. They are to marry...,Ted
"Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosley as legitimate spouses?",Priest
"Tell not the end! This is what I would say, if ever, I wanted to see a movie as bad. Continues.",Marshall
So they are to marry...,Ted
Stella!,Tony
Tony!,Stella
Tony?,Jed
"I must say something. Long ago, I left this beautiful daughter, Stella, to escape. And now she is with this jerk who does not appreciate the true value of this beautiful bride.",Tony
What is your problem?,Ted
You can not talk to me like that! I'm Ted Mosley!,Jed
"He said Ted, right?",Ted
"Stella, I promised you'd be my wife. And I would keep that promise.",Tony
Everything I wanted in my life was your love.,Stella
"Go ahead, darling, kiss him.",Priest
If you still love me... Would you be my bride?,Tony
"Bluntly, doll.",Stella
Stop! Dad!,Jed
"Take that, Ted Mosby!",Children
"Okay, he really said this time around.",Ted
"It was too much. I laugh, I cry. This is cinema, but it would not tell real people? It was so real! Why did you say Oh, no early in the film?",Royce
Nothing.,Ted
You must tell your story with Stella Royce. It will be released at one time or another.,Lily
Why? So why should it?,Ted
Because it is past the fifth most profitable films.,Robin
I do not care. I will take it to my grave. It's a silly movie anyway!,Ted
He looks like zero.,Lily
I'll never see him out of friendship for you.,Robin
She made her choice. Do not worry. I will not come to marriage.,Tony
You'll come! I'll take you there myself and force you to watch!,Jed
The code.,Tony
That's exactly what happened. It was all good. Even the thing with nunchakus.,Barney
It was not great the bride?,Royce
I too loved it!,Woman
We'll see tomorrow.,Man
It may come? Want to see it again?,Royce
"Yeah, that was good.",Ted
"Good? Rather perfect! The only thing, and for me it is a very small defect, compared to other films, is that I understand why Stella wants to marry a guy like Jed Mosley. Just the name of this guy: Jed Mosley...",Royce
"Royce, you're out with Jed Mosley, too.",Woman
"Who has not? It is a sacred number. A butterfly tattoo, how to pronounce this encyclopedia.",Royce
"Bluntly. Well, technically, this is the correct pronunciation.",Ted
"I was so happy that this loser is done let go before the altar. You know why? Because he saw it coming. And the best part is that he will live a long, sad life, knowing he has lost his only chance of happiness. And when he gets b*at up by the goat?",Royce
Too funny!,Woman
Bluntly!,Ted
What a loser!,Royce
"Bluntly! This guy's life was ruined by humiliation before the world. Too funny! It will take years before you can watch his family in front. It must be so traumatized that never again will he love or trust someone. It was insane! Get Moving, Adolf h*tler, a new king has arrived!",Ted
"Ted, you're okay?",Royce
I thought you would be interested to learn some stuff about this movie that you love. It is rotten. And you are all stupid to love.,Ted
"It was really bad, you should apologize.",Royce
"You said not altogether, doll?",Lily
You really used the phrase Jed Mosley?,Marshall
I know! I was so excited... How do you know it's his sentence?,Ted
I wanted to see Avatar.,Marshall
It's good. I will emigrate to a country where nobody saw the bride.,Ted
"Good luck. This film is international, it's great.",Robin
Maybe North Korea?,Lily
"I read that Kim Jong, he says it's his second favorite movie. Just after he made a film where the horse in slow motion.",Robin
"Sorry, Ted, you're screwed.",Lily
"No, you know, Ted is not screwed. You know why I'm nice? Because I'm crazy baggage people. Most people see another person with this big suitcase, and they spend doing nothing. But not me. I look at them and say, Hi, stranger. Can I help you? And you know who taught me to be like that? A Ted Mosby. A decent and sincere guy who has faith. And you know what, Ted? Inside you, you're still that guy.",Marshall
I still am.,Ted
You wanna go get that girl.,Marshall
I want to go get that girl.,Ted
For it is the love of your life.,Marshall
"Because it is... Yeah, well... We had 3 rencards. It's nice.",Ted
Because she's nice.,Marshall
"It's really nice! You're right, Marshall. I have to go retrieve it.And I know exactly where it is.",Ted
The wedding is in 15 minutes. I'll never make it.,Tony
You can do Sensei. Give a roundhouse kick to love. Live in the heart.,Child
You're right. What am I doing? There is still time!,Tony
"Do you, Stella, take Jed Mosley as legitimate spouses?",Priest
Royce!,Ted
Ted?,Royce
Ted?,Barney
Barney?,Ted
I must say something.,Tony
"I must say something. Long ago, I left that horrible daughter, Stella, break my heart. And now she is with this jerk who wrote a movie about it and this movie is called... The Future Bride.",Ted
What do you mean?,Royce
You can not talk to me like that!,Jed
"I'm Jed Mosley. But Royce, missed it... in that cowboy boots red, it's not me.",Ted
"To be clear, you're saying that you do not have boots red cowboy?",Barney
What...,Ted
I wanted... People want to know.,Barney
They are g*n in fact. I promised I'd make pancakes.And... I would keep that promise.,Ted
All I wanted was some pancakes this week.,Royce
"Come on, darling, kiss him.",Barney
You must go!,Man
This is outrageous. Thou hast embraced evil!,Barney
"Royce, if you...",Ted
Do I always appreciate... Would you like me to make pancakes?,Ted
"Bluntly, doll.",Royce
Kiss it! This film is embraced anyway.,Barney
"That happened to me, it was pretty hard. I am not fully recovered.",Ted
Let me help you.,Royce
It feels good to have you said those things. I'm happy to open myself to you.,Ted
"It's not that important. Me too, I was let go before the altar. Three times. The last time, because I lost all our money at poker. That's why I live with my brother.",Royce
"Wait, I thought you had a very small studio.",Ted
"Just the two of us. You'll see, he still pulls the duvet.",Royce
"Yeah, you need to go there.",Ted
"We agree, it's insane to have a child before he saw the five doubles, right?",Lily
"Sure, it goes without saying.",Marshall
"So when we finally see a dead ringer for Barney, this is the message of the universe to tell us to do. And at that time, we'll try. Deal?",Lily
Deal.,Marshall
You were serious with this story of the fifth lookalike?A baby is big enough to let the universe decide.,Marshall
"I know, it's crazy. It's easier to let the universe decide. Why?",Lily
Decided!,Marshall
Wait 2 seconds! It could easily be Barney who tries to f*ck chicks.,Lily
I've moved up.,Marshall
Barney here.,Barney
"Marshall. So, you're in the office? You're not, I do not know, driving a taxi, with a wig?",Marshall
"Yes, I'm in the office. This is the sound of my stapler.This is the sound of my trouilloteuse. And that, the sound of me, ranking the company's directive on sexual harassment. What's new? I gotta run, great leader.",Barney
Barney's office. It was the fifth double.,Marshall
Marshall Eriksen... put a baby in my belly.,Lily
"I hasten to add. This is one of the moments you dream about. Friends, Lily and I have unprotected relations. I have chills.",Marshall
We're going to say anything.,Lily
What? Why?,Marshall
"If you tell them, they are invited in at the most private and intimate of our lives.",Lily
"You kiss? Go on, I'm not even there. But just like that, have a baby: big mistake. Now, show me.",Barney
"Uncle Ted is here! How you will handle the story of Santa Claus? You should be honest. Damn, I will disguise myself.",Ted
Okay. I tell anyone.,Marshall
We saw the fifth lookalike!,Lily
Incredible!,Robin
That's great!,Ted
Bizarre. A Barney Brown.,Robin
"I know. Say what you want about him, but Barney is better blonde.",Lily
True. The blonde does not go to any guy.,Robin
I'm not sure.,Ted
What?,Lily
"This was where I was swimming teacher at Cascade Country Club of Grief, I washed the mop with lemon juice, playing with natural highlights. Let's just say that there were some old pretending to drown. Unfortunately, one has really drowned. In short, blonde suits me.",Ted
"I do not care, I can eat. Yes, we would like nachos.",Ted
"I love you buddy, but it is impossible that the blond you go well.",Marshall
It would not look good.,Robin
"Yeah, seriously, Ted, you not discolor hair.",Lily
I fade hair!,Ted
It is not at all what we expected!,Marshall
"So that's why Monty and I have vowed never to take drugs.Because the drug is bad. Not true, Monty?",Don
"Of course... the chemical stuff, yes. But, what grows in nature, they can try, like, a couple of times.",Robin
"We do not try to Shadow Zone, Monty.",Don
"I think that we should not lie to kids, Moo-Moo!",Robin
So... what do you mean?,Don
I've tried drugs.,Robin
What was that for?,Robin
"Before you, I had given up everything. Relationships, my career, my pants. You have given me want to try again. I love you for that.",Don
I see...,Robin
"Sorry. You do not know me. But I wanted to thank you.In fact, you are someone very important in my life.",Marshall
"No, go ahead. I'm listening.",Ted
"The executive producer of WNKW saw our show the other morning and I loved it. They offer me the position of presenter, starting next week.",Robin
That's great!,Ted
"Yes, but here's the thing... WNKW is...",Robin
"Helen, dryer stops!",Ted
Is Chicago.,Robin
"You're the fifth double. How can you be you? I called you, Barney. And we talked about!",Marshall
"Yes, I understand. My colleagues are oddly on the fact that I work. I know, I know.",Barney
"To make them believe that I break my ass, when in truth I break some ass, I made a special message. What's new? I gotta run, Grand Chief.",Barney
"It was a recording? You called me Big Chief, my nickname special job.",Marshall
"Come, Grand Chief.",Barney
Come on. Stops.,Marshall
Why it happens now? While all was well with Don. This is the never ending battle of my life: career vs. love.,Robin
"Endless Battle? Your career has crashed love for years.It's like the Globetrotters vs. the Generals. Crochet career in half, the love is greenhorns who deserve it the Italian league.",Ted
I'm lost. What do I do?,Robin
You really need to talk to Don.,Ted
I'm too upset to talk with him. I have to avoid the time I decide what I want.,Robin
"It sounds logical. Sorry to not be able to help you more than that. In truth, I can not be objective about the fact you're gone.",Ted
You did a manicure?,Robin
"No, I did not...",Ted
It makes a.,Woman
Why are you brown taxi driver?,Marshall
"Oh, that. You know how I dream of making love to a woman from each country?",Barney
Sure. You're doing well in the Baltics.,Marshall
I thought the fastest way to circumnavigate the world in 180 days. Take a taxi and wait before the United Nations.,Barney
It was the perfect plan. There's a detail I had not expected.,Barney
The girls not want to enter a taxi driver. I worked hard on it.,Barney
I think so. I must confess to Lily that the fifth lookalike is false.,Marshall
What's the problem?,Barney
"Lily decided that once you have seen all the doubles, we try to have children.",Marshall
Children!? No! Rule: no children under 45! You never read my blog!? He has improved a lot.,Barney
"I'm ready to be a father, you know? But Lily needs a sign of the universe. It could take years.",Marshall
"Sorry, pal. It'll be $ 37.50.",Barney
"The universe has spoken. Marshall Eriksen, make a baby.",Lily
"They told me, so I've prepared a few. I organize a marriage. Tell me, Billy Idol, it's going to do? More on Billy Idol.If someone wants the real Slim Shady, it's there. This one was good. Robin, why do not you help me?",Barney
"First, I get lots of compliments. Then tell her.",Ted
It gets no compliments.,Robin
The other thing.,Ted
It may be that I moved to Chicago next week.,Robin
"Just to know, but it would do the same if we had not seen the Barney look-alike, eh?",Marshall
"But we have seen, which means that the universe in its infinite wisdom, tell me of planting, and apply yourself.",Lily
I can not. I can in good conscience you plant.,Marshall
I know what's bothering you.,Lily
Really?,Marshall
The taxi driver looked like enough to Barney.,Lily
"Well, there you got wrong.",Marshall
Time out! This is a group decision! You can not go to Chicago before we are all agreed.,Barney
I think Robin...,Ted
"Stay out of it, Brigitte Nielsen and Dolph Lundgren in Rocky IV! We need Marshall and Lily.",Barney
It was smaller than Barney!,Lily
It was the same size!,Marshall
"And you know what? I think he was Asian. Yeah, this guy was a little Asian with a graying goatee and belly.",Lily
You forgot what looks like Barney?,Marshall
You kiss?,Barney
Why are you in our room?  Why are you in our room?  Why Ellen DeGeneres is in our room?,Marshall
It works!,Ted
Wait a second. Candles... flowers... I guess that Marshall has forgotten to tell you. The fifth lookalike... it was me.,Barney
"What? Wait, you were aware? You lied to me?",Lily
"By omission, because this idea of let the world decide is crazy.",Marshall
"Baby, you...",Lily
We must control our...,Marshall
Friends! We forget what is really important here. Ted is blond.,Barney
"Friends, I'm doing well. Robin has something important to say.",Ted
It failed him.,Robin
The other thing.,Ted
He had a manicure.,Robin
The other thing.,Ted
I had a job offer in Chicago.,Robin
That's why we're all here. For Robin to deter...,Barney
"Actually, I already made my decision. Friends, I must accept.",Robin
I can not believe that Robin is going to lose.,Ted
"And besides, it was a big mistake. I will re-stain the hair.",Ted
Finally.,Lily
I told you so.,Marshall
Not so great that.,Barney
So I was on the phone with Chicago.,Robin
"Yes, I made my decision. I appreciate the offer, but I can not accept it. Thank you.",Robin
I'm staying.,Robin
"Tell me... Did you see the real Barney driving the taxi, and you thought it was a little Asian pot-bellied.",Marshall
"I know. It's weird, huh?",Lily
It's not weird. That means you're not ready. Sorry for wanting to rush things. Our baby can expect the real dead ringer for Barney.,Marshall
Hello Moo-Moo! Monty did you do an extra-fine pizza just as you love them! Are you okay?,Robin
You'll never believe it. I was offered the position of presenter WNKW in Chicago.,Don
You said what?,Robin
I agreed. It's been years I expect this opportunity.,Don
Barney?,Marshall
I'm single mountebank of Estonia. Who is this Barney?,Sosie
It's just a guy we know who has a blog and really bad.,Marshall
"It seems that he is improving. Finally, what is it, blog?",Sosia
This is something that was cool 8 years ago.,Marshall
Always cool. It looks pretty cool.,Sosia
What's your name?,Lily
Kristof.,Sosia
how Kristof?,Lily
Kristof... Sosie.,Sosia
Really? Your last name is Sosie?,Marshall
"It's my name, man.",Lookalike
Wait. Trying to understand.,Don
I'm going.,Robin
Wait. Put yourself in my place. You can imagine what it is to be offered a dream job?,Don
"I can. Good luck in Chicago, Don.",Robin
"Barney, why are you doing this?",Lily
Wait a second. Is it possible that Barney Stinson secretly hope they have children?,Marshall
Who is Barney? Calm down the U.S.!,Sosia
Let me talk about him. He keeps saying that nobody should have children before 45 years.,Lily
I'd be interested to read what he has to say in his blog.,Sosie
"But I think I know what happens. Yesterday, Barney felt obliged to say goodbye to someone he really likes. And it made him think... A baby joining our group might not be the worst thing.",Lily
Babies... this can be cute.,Sosia
"And one day he will be the best uncle in the world. Because it Barney, he is part of our family.",Lily
Excuse me. I heard you come from Estonia. So do I.,Woman
Excuse me a moment. Estonia Baltic countries would complete!,Barney
And I'm like you clown.,Woman
Say yes to that.,Robin
Yes.,Ted
I can re-move?  Is I'm the biggest idiot in the world?,Robin
"Think of all of us, five years ago, when we met you.Marshall and Lily were friends as little. Today they are married and think about the children. And Barney? He would never get involved with anyone. And last year, he fell in love. And me? I was chasing a girl, convinced she was right. Today it is one of my best friends. And you? 5 years ago, you would never put love before your career, but now you did it.",Ted
Seems like I become more and more stupid.,Robin
"Just more courageous. We all looked for the 5 lookalikes.But eventually, over time, we all become our own doubles.These completely different people who look exactly like us. The Robin, there was 5 years? This girl was pretty cool. Robin lookalike? She's great.  We drank a lot.",Ted
I do not care.,Robin
"What? I forgot, I'm blond. I have blonde hair.",Ted
Yes! You're there! This is fantastic!,Lily
"Calm down. Your husband is here. Trying to hide it, at least.",Barney
"The friends, follow me!  Look! The fifth double.",Lily
This guy looks like me...,Barney
Guys... Play the game,Marshall
It's amazing.,Marshall
Is not it?,Lily
It looks like Barney.,Robin
Amazing.,Ted
It's like looking in a mirror.,Barney
Does that mean...?,Marshall
Marshall Eriksen... put a baby in my belly.,Lily
Nice! Where'd you get this?,Ted
Stashed a cooler behind the pulpit. Beer be with you.,Marshall
"And also with you. Man, this is what church has been missing. Dude, you fixed church.",Ted
"Yeah. You're welcome, God. Nervous?",Marshall
What? No. I'm just hoping it doesn't rain. Why? Do I look nervous?,Ted
"Look at your beer, dude. You always do that when you're nervous.",Marshall
"Barney, I really... I have to grade these papers.",Ted
"I'm sorry. I'll let you work. But first, a riddle: What piece of women's attire most stokes a man's desire?",Barney
A sun dress.,Ted
"Correct. What lightweight outfit, pink or white, makes the front of my slacks abnormally tight?",Barney
I really have to get this done.,Ted
"Of course, of course.",Barney
Thank you.,Ted
"Sun dress, by the way. Hey! What are you nervous about? Tell me. Tell me. Tell me. What flowing cotton frock...",Barney
"Okay, I'll tell you. Just... There's a... There's a girl sitting at the bar. Don't look!",Ted
I want to see a pretty girl.,Barney
"Okay, you can look. Just-just-just be cool for once.",Ted
"I'll be cool. Ah, Ted. You got your beer label in a bunch over nothing. Listen to your Uncle Barney. You have no reason to be nervous. None whatsoever. And I'm going to tell you why in one word.",Barney
And what's that word?,Ted
Dibs!,Barney
What... You can't call dibs on a girl I've been sitting here thinking about maybe talking to eventually at some point.,Ted
You never called dibs.,Barney
Dibs were implied.,Ted
Implied dibs?,Barney
Yeah.,Ted
"Ted, you are spitting on the grave of Sir Walter Dibs, inventor of the dib. It was 1652... The SS Dibs was lost at sea...",Barney
"Look, I don't have time for a fake history lesson, so I'll keep this simple. You go over there and talk to that girl, I will see you in court.",Ted
And who's gonna represent you? Dibs on Marshall as my lawyer!,Barney
Damn it!,Ted
Where is Marshall anyway?,Barney
"Okay, I'm almost ready to leave. Let's just go through the checklist. Candles?",Marshall
Check.,Lily
Music to set the mood?,Marshall
Check.,Lily
Music for when we're actually doing it?,Marshall
Check.,Lily
You know what? To hell with your dibs. I'm going over there right now and talking to her.,Ted
"Oh, yeah, yeah? Be my guest. Fall in love with her. Get married. Just know this: When I step up to make my toast as your best man...",Barney
"Actually, Marshall would probably be...",Ted
As your best man...,Barney
Ladies and Gentlemen... I... had dibs.,Barney
No!,Ted
What?,Barney
I had implied dibs.,Ted
"Shhh, shh. You're the v*ctim here. We both are. Let's get out of here.",Barney
We could just do it right here.,Barney
Fine. Have at it. Exercise your dibs. She's got her shields up anyway. She's reading a book.,Ted
"Yeah. At a bar. That book might as well be called, Are You There, Barney? It's Me, Horny. That is not what shields up looks like. (",Barney
Move. God! (,Robin
"Oh, good God, woman. You're a disgrace.",Barney
No fries for this guy.,Robin
"Robin, seriously, I love you, but it's like you have squiggly cartoon odor lines coming off of you right now.",Barney
"You know what, Barney? Just cut her some slack, okay? She just went through a breakup.",Ted
With hygiene?,Barney
"Here, have some tea.",Ted
Thanks.,Robin
"Robin, I am here for you. Whatever you need.",Ted
"Okay, about that. Ted, listen. I know myself pretty well. And, some time over the next few months, I'm going to want to sleep with you. And when that happens, you have to try to say no.",Robin
Try? I will absolutely say no. Our friendship is too important.,Ted
"Okay, you know, maybe I wasn't clear enough. I will come at you with everything I've got. I will stalk you like the lioness stalks the gazelle: careful, patient, deadly. And if you let your guard down for so much as a second, as sure as you were born, I will hump your brains out.",Robin
"Okay, I'm ready to have sex now.",Robin
"It was a tough summer, but I think our girl's been a real trooper. She's... Is this a Cheeto?",Ted
"No, we ran out of Cheetos last week. Oh, yeah, it's a Cheeto. Dibs.",Robin
"Oh, you're exquisite. You must let me paint you.",Barney
"Hey Robin, what do you think? The girl sitting at the bar. Shields up?",Ted
"Mmm, totes, toots. She's here on a date. She brought the book because she got here early, and she also wants to impress the guy she's meeting. Girls like to come across all classy and smart, you know? ",Robin
This? What you're doing right now? I'm getting a de-rection.,Barney
Hey! How'd it go? You pregnant yet?,Ted
Nope!,Marshall
"Okay, so, here's what happened. I was at home, waiting for Marshall.",Lily
"Hey! How was your day? Don't answer. No time. Bedroom. No, no. No time. Floor. No, no time. Against this wall!",Marshall
"Marshall, whoa! Wait. A big package just arrived.",Lily
"Yeah, it did.",Marshall
"No, no. It's a real package from your dad.",Lily
"Well, that's a little weird, but yeah, it is.",Marshall
"Marshall, look!",Lily
"A bassinet? Oh, my... He must've made it in his wood shop. Wasn't that sweet of him? Lil? Isn't that sweet? Lily?",Marshall
You told your dad we're trying to have a baby?,Lily
Of course I did. I tell my dad everything. My dad is my best friend.,Marshall
"We have been looking forward to this magical, special night for two weeks now. And, sweetie, during that time, I have been... How do I put this delicately? Saving all my love for you.",Marshall
"I have read 11 books on conception. I have cut out alcohol, caffeine and sugar. I take my temperature every hour. But good for you for not playing with yourself.",Lily
"I feel you, buddy.",Ted
"Ah, no! Don't even touch me, dude. It's been, like... It's been two weeks. I'm, like, a light breeze away from having a big problem. Seriously. ",Marshall
"Okay, Barney. What's this going to cost me?",Ted
Excuse me?,Barney
Your dibs. I want to buy your dibs.,Ted
Two... hundred... and fifty thousand dollars.,Barney
20 bucks.,Ted
But I... Can I go smell her first?,Barney
No. ,Ted
Fine. ,Barney
All right. Wish me luck.,Ted
Get out.,Cindy
Good.,Cindy
What the hell are you doing?,Barney
That girl she's talking to? I dated her.,Ted
"Oh, that sucks! And dibs.",Barney
"So you went on one date with one of her friends. It's not necessarily a big deal. I mean, did it end on bad terms?",Robin
"Well, I guess you just got to move on. I mean, it's not like you have a sh*t with Ready McGee over there, right? Ted?",Robin
I got to see her ankles.,Ted
"You're one of those? God, I swear, one in five guys...",Robin
"Lily! We kind of had a plan tonight, remember? Candles? Banjo?",Marshall
Who else did you tell? Did you tell anyone at the office?,Lily
Shannon? Start the music...,Marshall
"I may have mentioned it in passing to a couple of colleagues at work. I'm sorry about that, but you know what? I got to be able to tell my dad.",Marshall
"Your dad is the last person you should tell! The man is too involved in our lives! It's like, every time the phone rings...",Lily
Hello.,Lily
"No, I'm gonna...",Lilly
Hello.,Lily
Hello.,Lily
Pickles would have helped that sandwich!,Marshall
The man has no boundaries. And I just can't procreate under these conditions!,Lily
"Yeah, well, you know what? I've already told him, so the damage is done.",Marshall
"So, call him and tell him we decided not to have a baby.",Lily
"Okay, so you just... You want me to give my dad a stroke?",Marshall
Only if you want to give this a stroke.,Lily
"That's ridiculous. Lily, there is no way that I would ever... Okay, everyone needs to shut up so that I can think!",Marshall
They're talking to a guy now.,Robin
What kind of guy? A cheesy guy or a cool guy?,Ted
"Oh, a cheesy guy. Don't worry.",Robin
"Oh, man! That guy is cool. His hair's all cool, he's got a cool belt.",Ted
"Well, that guy is cheesy, and if you think he's not cheesy, then you're cheesy, too, and now I want something cheesy. Who's feeling nachos?",Robin
"Oh, look at you, Robin. You're jealous.",Barney
Jealous?,Robin
"Yeah, jealous, because she's got it, and you've lost it.",Barney
I have not lost it.,Robin
You lost it.,Barney
"I still have it. I know exactly where it is, and I can go get it whenever I want.",Robin
"Robin, girls are like cartons of milk. Each one has a hotness expiration date, and you've hit yours. I'm not saying the occasional guy won't still open the fridge, pick you up, give a sniff, shrug and take a sip anyway But it's all downhill from here.",Barney
I don't have to take this. But I do have to take this.,Robin
"Okay, so you just want me to call my dad and tell him that we're not having a baby?",Marshall
That's about the size of it.,Lilly
"Okay, out of curiosity,when do we tell him about the baby?",Marshall
We'll tell him about the baby when there's a baby to tell him about.,Lily
"So, he just gets no notice? He just walks into his boss's office, and says, I just had a grandson. I'm gonna be out for three months.",Marshall
Out for three months?,Lily
Yeah. He and my mom are coming to live with us when the baby's born. We talked about this.,Marshall
"No, we didn't.",Lily
"I meant, me and my dad.",Marshall
"You know what, Marshall? Why don't you have a baby with your dad?",Lily
"Oh, okay, Lily.Why don't you have a baby with your butt?",Marshall
What?,Lily
I can't think straight! Why do you have to wear that shirt? This is not how I thought this night was going to go!,Marshall
Ted?,Cindy
"Oh, God, this sucks! Do you think she saw me?",Ted
"Hi, Ted!",Cindy
"Yeah, she definitely saw you.",Barney
Can I see you for a minute... in private?,Cindy
"Yeah. Yeah, sure. I mean, how could that not be fun? If I don't come back, tell my mom I love her.",Ted
"Okay, will do. And dibs.",Barney
"Barney, am I crazy? Marshall talks to his dad way too much, right?",Lily
"Oh, you don't want my opinion on that.",Barney
Why not?,Lily
"If I had my dad's number, I would never not be on the phone with him.",Barney
That was really...,Lily
"Whoa, a hottie with a body! Boing...!",Barney
Brief.,Lily
"No. Lily, look. ",Barney
"14 seconds! 14 seconds, and already some dingdong is stepping up, thinking he can get some of this broke off. I... still... got... it. All right, buddy, you proved my point. Now scram. Nice belt, by the way.",Robin
"Robin, you do look super hot.",Barney
"Oh, do I?",Robin
"Yeah, you do.",Barney
Thanks.,Robin
"Thank you, Ted. After things didn't work out with us, I got really sad for a while. But then I realized, you're not what I wanted, Ted, and I'm not what you wanted. I'm sorry I was such a jerk. I feel like I should make it up to you somehow. You know, buy you a beer or Yankees tickets, or...",Cindy
"Or set me up with one of your friends. No, I'm kidding. That would be weird.",Ted
"No, it wouldn't.",Cindy
"It wouldn't, would it? Any one of those three. Whichever's easiest and right nearby. And not the beer.",Ted
I should get back.,Cindy
Totally.,Ted
Come say good-bye before you leave.,Cindy
Say good-bye before you leave?,Robin
Her words exactly.,Ted
"Dude, you are so in. That is so awesome. A high five doesn't even cut it. High six!",Barney
"She didn't see us high-six, did she?",Ted
No. Good. That was pretty lame.,Barney
"Yeah, let's never do that again.",Ted
Marshall?,Lily
"What? Lily, what? Are there more members of my family that you want to crap all over?",Marshall
Here's the thing.,Lily
"I'm sorry. Hold on. Just... It's my dad. Lily, it's my dad, okay? I love him, and if he calls me, I'm gonna answer the phone! Hey, Dad.",Marshall
"Hey, hey. I know it's late, but I just had to call. How'd it go?",Marvin
"Dad, this is...",Marshall
Did you do everything the books say? Did you put the pillow under her back?,Marvin
"Dad, I'm in the middle of something right now.",Marshall
Did it feel like a boy? You can tell.,Marvin
"He's insane. My dad is insane. I'm so sorry, Lily. He's just... He's so... enthusiastic. It's ridiculous, you know? Like, who's like that?",Marshall
"You. You're like that. You and your dad both care so much. It's... it's why women fall in love with the Eriksen men to begin with. But right now, it's a lot of pressure.",Lily
"Baby, I'm not trying to pressure you one bit.",Marshall
What if I can't have a baby? That could happen. I could totally let you down. Has that thought not occurred to you?,Lily
"Not even for one second. Not having a baby would suck, but the idea of you letting me down... that's impossible. That would be like aliens landing. That's a bad example, because that could happen. It probably already has. I saw this, episode... All right.",Marshall
I'm doing this. I am going over there. Wish me luck.,Ted
"Like I said, she's here on a date.",Robin
"Okay, maybe I'm a little nervous.",Ted
"Dude, it's just a wedding toast.",Marshall
"I know. I just... I want it to be great, you know? I want this whole day to be great.",Ted
It will be.,Marshall
Best man? You're being summoned.,Lily
"Geez, what now?",Ted
"Ted, seriously, relax. Everything's... Okay, and it's raining.",Marshall
Yeah. You were saying?,Ted
"You didn't happen to bring an umbrella, did you?",Marshall
No. I didn't bring an umbrella.,Ted
"I mean, everyone told us that it might take a while, but... We thought we might be the exception to the rule. Anyways, we're getting back on that horse. I mean, feeling good about the future. Obviously, this goes without saying, but you won't tell Lily about any of this, right?",Marshall
No! Of course! Absolutely!,Ted
"So, this chick and I are going at it behind the Central Park Zoo. The Bonobo chimps start giving us a standing O, and just when I'm about to give her the same thing... What up?... I... I can't. I just... I can't. Guys, I know you count the minutes until you can escape from your humdrum lives by hearing how awesome mine is, and I love doing that for you, but I just can't tonight.",Barney
What's wrong?,Robin
I don't want to talk about it.,Barney
"Okay. Hey, you guys see Deadliest Catch last night?",Robin
Did I ever! Deadliest Catch ever!,Ted
"All right, I'll tell you! My mother is selling the house I grew up in. All of my childhood memories gone, just like that!",Barney
"That sucks. I've been there, buddy.",Ted
What are you talking about? Your mother still lives in the house you grew up in.,Marshall
"With her new hippie husband, Clint. The comfort of home is a little ruined when someone turns your old room into what I'm pretty sure is a Tantric sex temple. With all the bamboo, pot smoke and '60s music, it's like my old G.I. Joes are frozen in some weird Vietnam flashback.",Ted
"Anyway, I need you guys to come out to Staten Island on Saturday and help box everything up.",Barney
You expect us to spend a whole day packing up your mom's house?,Lily
Of course not. It's a two-day job.,Barney
Pass.,Robin
Same.,Ted
Unsubscribe.,Marshall
"You guys are adorable. You seriously believe that I, Barney Stinson, can't talk you into this? I got the Queen to give me a fist bump.",Barney
No one believes that story.,Ted
"You may be able to talk the brain surgeons you pick up into doing whatever you want, but it's not gonna work on us.",Lily
How did he do that?,Lily
"Whoa, Ted, that thing you're packing is way too big to fit in that box.",Barney
"Yeah, that's what your mom said.",Ted
How dare you!,Barney
"No, she actually said that.",Ted
"Oh, dear, I thought I told you, that's just not going to fit in there.",Lauretta
"Someone order something tall, dark and awesome?",James
James!,Everyone
Bro!,Barney
How you doing?,Ted
Hey!,James
"Oh, my goodness!",Lauretta
Mama.,James
Look at my two sons. So big and strong and handsome.,Lauretta
Mom. Stop.,Barney
"And how is my delicious little grandson? Oh, did he get the clothes I sent him?",Lauretta
"Check it. Huh? How cute is that, right? When was the last time you saw a diaper poking out of a Dolce and Gabana suit?",James
Tuesday at work. Some of the senior partners are really getting up there.,Barney
"So, Ted, yesterday at work, I totally talked you up to that super-hot makeup girl, Liz.",Robin
Oh yeah? Mm-hmm. What did you say?,Ted
"Oh, you know, how funny you are...",Robin
Guilty.,Ted
Handsome.,Robin
"Who, me?",Ted
Incredible lover.,Robin
Really?,Ted
"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I was all like, He knows a woman's body better than she knows her own, endless waves of pleasure just cresting and breaking for hours and hours... Blah, blah, blah. Orgasms so intense that you just black out. All that stuff.",Robin
"Robin, how can I possibly live up to that review?",Ted
"What? You know what you're doing down there. Oh, Teddy Westside can bring it. We know this.",Robin
"But that is not the point. I mean, you broke the first rule of setting people up: undersell. It's like, if someone's never seen The Karate Kid, you don't say, It's the greatest movie ever. You say, Uh, it's pretty good And then they see it, it blows their freakin' mind. Because Cobra Kai sensei's all like, Sweep the leg! And Daniel-san's all like... ",Ted
Maybe I did oversell you a bit.,Robin
Thank you guys so much for helping us out with this stuff.,James
"Oh, it gives us a rare insight into the makings of Barney Stinson. Like, look at this. Who was a cute little basketball player before he became the biggest pervert in the world?",Lily
"I loved Pee Wee basketball. Well, until they kicked me off the team... I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",Barney
"I was so awesome, the coach asked me to quit because it wasn't fair to the other kids.",Barney
That sounds plausible.,Marshall
"Hey. It's true. Tell him, James.",Barney
"Oh, yeah, he had, like, a four-foot vertical leap. He would hit it from the outside, hit it from the inside... He sucked. Coach cut him from the team, and Mom fed him that story so he'd feel better.",James
"Oh, my God! Look at this. My letter from the Postmaster General. I still can't believe he took the time to write this...",Barney
"Dear Barney... I sincerely apologize about losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party. That's why none of your classmates showed up. Not because you threw up when they turned the lights off at the Planetarium. No one even noticed that. Also, Janey Masterson's mother is a whore, and with gin on her breath at 10:00 in the morning, she's got some nerve kicking us out of the carpool. Love, Postmaster General.",Barney
Thank you.,Barney
Does your mom make stuff like that up a lot?,Marshall
"Constantly. I mean, she put more effort into some lies than others.",James
Mom? Who's my dad? All the other kids at school know who their dad is. Who's mine?,Barney
"Oh, I don't know... That guy.",Loretta
"Did she tell you that Bob Barker was your dad, too?",Robin
"No. No, no. I heard Flip Wilson, Bill Cosby, James Earl Jones, Meadowlark Lemon... The list goes on. I still can't get a straight answer about who my real dad is. And Barney's no help. He still believes every lie that my mom told us growing up. Not me. I caught on early.",James
Careful! Michael Jackson sent me this glove for my tenth...,Barney
Damn. Loretta really lied a lot to her kids.,Ted
"Well, she's not alone. Whenever Marshall was acting too hyper, his mom would suddenly decide he was sick and give him cough medicine until he passed out.",Lily
"I'm pretty sure that's what stunted my growth. I hit 6'4 in the fifth grade, and then I just stopped.",Marshall
And then there's the most popular parental lie in history. Santa.,Lily
"Yeah, but that's a good lie. Like when we tell Ted he'll meet the right girl and settle down.",Marshall
I always find that reassuring.,Ted
"You will meet her, buddy.",Marshall
You think so?,Ted
Yeah!,Marshall
"Santa's still a lie, and I'm not lying to our kids.",Lily
"Baby, it's Santa. Don't you want our kids going to sleep on Christmas Eve with their hearts full of hope, their heads full of crazy cough syrup nightmares, knowing that downstairs Kris Kringle is stuffing their stockings full of joy and stuffing his belly full of milk and lutefisk that they left him?",Marshall
Milk and lutefisk? Santa doesn't get cookies in Minnesota?,Lily
"Yeah, that's just what Santa needs at 3:00 a.m. when he's battling a snowstorm over the Rockies: a sugar crash. No. Santa needs protein.",Marshall
I'm not lying to our kids.,Lily
Ah... Valentines. The second base of third grade. I always got a Valentine from every single girl in my class.,Barney
"Funny how all these girls have the exact same handwriting as the Postmaster General, Mom, and... home run king, Frank Aaron.",James
"Yeah, school girls... The more they ignore you, pretend to hate your guts, lock you in the coatroom over winter break, the more they secretly like you. This isn't... Who's Sam Gibbs?",Barney
No idea. Why?,James
Mom addressed this and never sent it.,Barney
What's in it?,James
"Hey.  It's a picture of you and me when we were little kids. On the back, Mom wrote... Your son.",Barney
"Okay, everyone, lunch is ready. Who wants Sloppy Joes?",Loretta
"Mom, who's Sam Gibbs?",James
That doesn't sound familiar. Who wants Sloppy Joes?,Loretta
There's a picture of me and Barney in an envelope addressed to him. And you wrote your son on the back.,James
"Oh, no, that... It says Yourson. For Yourson, North Dakota. That's where we took the picture. Lovely town. We went kayaking, and you two rescued the mayor's dog, which had wandered into the rapids. That mayor, Sam Gibbs, asked for your picture so the city could make statues of you both. I guess I never sent it. That's embarrassing. Now, how about those Sloppy Joes?",Loretta
"If this picture was taken in North Dakota, then why is our old swing set in the background?",James
"I don't know! I did my best as a single parent, and it wasn't always easy, and I'd recommend putting the coleslaw right on top of the Sloppy Joe, because it's delicious that way!",Loretta
Can you believe her?,James
"I know. Forgetting to send the photo. That poor sculptor had to work from memory. Those statues probably look nothing like us. Damn it, Mom!",Barney
"So, Ted? You were worried that I oversold you to Liz. Well, I fixed it.",Robin
How?,Ted
"I sent her another email. Dear Liz. I hope it didn't sound like I was trying to oversell Ted. The truth is, he is a genuinely nice, down to earth guy, and I think you two would really hit it off.",Robin
Thank you. Thank you. That's perfect. That totally takes the pressure...,Ted
"Is he going to rock your world in bed? No. But he's clean, open to criticism, and not into anything too weird. He's not bad at all. Not bad at all.",Robin
"See, now you went too far in the other...",Ted
I'll be honest. The first few times aren't going to be that great. He's going to say 'Are you finished?' more times than a waiter in a busy restaurant.,Robin
Stop!,Ted
"Listen to me. There is no Yourson, North Dakota. Mom... And Sam Gibbs wasn't the mayor. He might be one of our fathers.",James
"Well, he's not my dad. My dad's Bob Barker.",Barney
"Barney! You... You've got to stop living in these fairy tales that Mom told us! Bob Barker is not your father. Sam Gibbs might be, but Bob Barker is absolutely, unequivocally not your father.",James
"I suppose you have a problem with the Easter Bunny, too.",Marshall
Not now.,Lily
"This address isn't too far. Are you coming with me, or not?",James
"So we're doing this? We're really going to go disturb the peaceful Long Island retirement of the former mayor of Yourson, North Dakota on a Sunday afternoon? Real classy, James. Real classy.",Barney
You're just too scared to face the truth. You're living in a dream world.,James
Maybe we shouldn't have brought these Sloppy Joes.,Marshall
"Oh, what's done is done.",Lily
Ted Mosby is solid as a rock. No. Dependable. No. Rugged. No.,Ted
Why don't I just go to the Chevy Web site and copy down adjectives?,Robin
I just want to hit that perfect middle ground.,Ted
"How about we just go wildly to both extremes and just let them balance each other out? Ted Mosby is really handsome, but extremely violent, and really rich, but lacks bladder control. Oh, damn.",Robin
What?,Ted
That last bump just made me hit send.,Robin
"Oh, no.",Ted
Don't worry. I'm sure that everyone will get it's a joke.,Robin
"No, they won't. They're going to think... Wait. Everyone?",Ted
Really rich?,Barney
You ready for this?,James
"For what? I don't know who lives here, but it's not my dad. Wait. Wait. Please, stop. Just... just give me a second, okay?",Barney
I thought you said that he... Stop.,James
"Come on. I know Bob Barker's not really... you know. I'm not crazy. I just... I needed that. I know it may sound stupid, but I didn't always feel so great about myself growing up, and so having a celebrity dad made me feel special. But you're right, James. It's time to let go of the fantasies. It's time to grow up.",Barney
Come here.,James
Yeah... you're Sam Gibbs.,James
"I'm James Stinson, and, I think you may have known my mother, Loretta Stinson... in the '70s.",James
"Loretta! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I... I knew Loretta.",Sam
My mother meant to send you this.,James
You're my son.,Sam
"God, this must be so hard for Barney.",Lily
"Yeah, but you know what? He took a big step today...",Marshall
"Papa! Look at us!nIt's like three of the same guy. Oh, my God, this explains why I was always so awesome at basketball. Guys, I'm black! Sorry. African-American. No. I'm allowed to say either. I got to go get my camera!",Barney
"That is my younger brother, Barney. He just thought he'd meet his real dad today, and clearly, he's not taking it so well.",James
"Oh, my head's kind of spinning, too. I mean, Loretta and I only saw each other for a couple of months. You were two before I even knew you existed, and at that point, your mother made it very clear she was going to raise you on her own. I felt I had to respect her wishes, but I always wanted to meet you.",Sam
"Wait. Barney and James are two years apart. If Sam only knew Loretta for a few months, he couldn't possibly be Barney's father.",Ted
He's also quite the detective.,Robin
Don't worry. We'll... We'll snap Barney out of this when he gets back.,Lily
"Or, he could just let him have this one.",Marshall
What?,Ted
Are you kidding?,Lily
"Guys, Barney's losing his childhood home, he finally admitted Bob Barker's not his dad, and then he watched James meet his real father. It's just a lot to go through in one afternoon. Can't we just let the guy be black for a day?",Marshall
"Here, Ted. Capture the moment!",Barney
"I think you'd need Salvador Dali to capture this particular moment, but I'll give it a whirl.",Ted
"Man... I thought I was a light-skinned Caucasian, but in truth, I'm a really light-skinned African-American. Man, try to hail a cab in Manhattan. Am I right? Nope, no one's stopping for this. These guys don't understand what I'm talking about.",Barney
Come on. You know this. Come on.,Sam
There you go. Come on.,Sam
Weird day.,Robin
Weird day.,Ted
"Hey, look at that! Liz still wants to meet you. That's great!",Robin
I guess. Wait a minute. You said Liz was a total ten. Why would she want to meet the incontinent freak show you described? You oversold her!,Ted
Maybe a little.,Robin
You said she was a ten.,Ted
I did not specify on what scale.,Robin
You said she looked like a movie star.,Ted
"She does. It's Robert De Niro, but, like, super buff, like in Cape Fear.",Robin
"Dad, look how fast I can run!",Barney
"He's actually a really sweet guy, and he's great with my son.",James
I have a grandson?,Sam
His name's Eli.,James
He's beautiful.,Sam
"Dad, you're not looking!",Barney
Barney? I need to talk to you.,Loretta
"Me first. Mom, there's something that I need to ask you, and I... I want you to be honest with me. Why do white people like Carrot Top?",Barney
"Listen... I always wanted to be enough for you boys. I think that's why it always hurt whenever you asked about your dads, because I was always trying so hard to be both parents for you. But I was being selfish. You deserve the truth. So here it is. Sam is not your father.",Loretta
Are you sure?,Barney
"Yes. He's black, dear. But if you want, I can tell you who your father really is.",Loretta
"What'd Coach say, Ma?",Barney
He said you're simply too good to be on the team. It's not fair to the other boys. But that's okay. We can just play together in the backyard.,Loretta
Why didn't anyone come?,Barney
"Oh, you know what, dear? Apparently, there was a mix-up with the mail. I just got this letter from the Postmaster General. Dear Barney, I sincerely apologize for losing all the invitations you sent out to your eighth birthday party.",Loretta
Barney.,Loretta
"It's okay, Mom. I don't need it.",Barney
But it's your father.,Loretta
I already have a father. And his name... is Loretta.,Barney
Wait. Dad! James! Where are you going? That's the best part. Can we go camping?,Barney
"Unfinished. Of all the words you could use to describe La Sagrada Familia... Brown, pointy, weird... The one that really seems to stick is unfinished. Why? Because on June 7, 1926, the architect Antoni Gaudi... Whose beard was also brown, pointy, weird and unfinished......was run over by a bus. And so, his greatest masterpiece would remain forever...",Ted
"Ted, look across the bar. Three chicks: one hot, one kind of hot and one who I'm assuming is really funny. We ride! What's wrong?",Barney
I don't know. Got a burger coming.,Ted
"Bro, I told you, if you ever need a wingman, I'm your guy.",Marshall
"Yeah, I'm not going to go through that again.",Barney
Hi. Barney Stinson.,Barney
"And I'm Marshall, Barney's wingman.",Marshall
Thank you for your time.,Barney
Fine. I'll have a three-way with hot and kind of hot while Giggles works the camera. I ride!,Barney
"So, get this: Last night, I was watching TV, and it turns out, some random satellite channel picks up a certain local Chicago newscast.",Robin
"Oh, man, it's bad enough to have to go through a horrible breakup, but then have that person pop up on your TV? Are you okay?",Ted
"Well, I'll admit, at first, I felt a little weird. But after the initial shock, I realized something: I've moved on. Finished with that. It was a peaceful moment of closure.",Robin
That's great. Good for you.,Ted
"Yeah, thank you.",Robin
"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
Excuse me?,Robin
"When I was a kid, I had a dog named Bean. Whenever he made the face that you're making right now, you just knew he pooped somewhere in the house. Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
I don't know what you're talking about.,Robin
"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
There's no poop.,Robin
Where's the poop?,Lily
Okay. So it wasn't entirely a peaceful moment of closure.,Robin
"Hey, Don, here's some breaking news: there's a zit breaking ou on your forehead. Finished with that.",Robin
"Look, I'm not proud, but Don left so quickly that I never got the chance to have that final showdown. So yelling at him, even on TV, felt kind of good. And you know what? Now I truly am over him.",Robin
That's great.,Ted
Thank you.,Robin
"Good for you. Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
"Damn it! Okay, in the process of truly getting over him, I may have called him and left an... indelicate voice mail.",Robin
"I am gonna k*ll you. I'm gonna fly to Chicago, k*ll you, put your stupid face on a deep dish pizza and eat it. And then maybe catch a Bears game. But mostly the k*ll and eating your face thing.",Robin
Give me your phone. We're deleting Don's number.,Lily
Don't worry. I am never doing that again. It was a one-time thing.,Robin
Prove it. Delete contact.,Lily
There. Deleted.,Robin
"Back already. How was flying solo? And by solo, I mean so low that you got sh*t down.",Marshall
"Look, I didn't get sh*t down. Trust me, I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes. This is all part of the plan. After initial contact, I'm now in the ignoring phase.",Barney
"Barney, why can't you just take a girl out to dinner like a normal person?",Lily
"Golden rule: I do not buy dinner to get the yes. Dinner's a very intimate activity. It requires a level of connection and eye contact that sex just doesn't. Call me old-fashioned, but I need to have sex with a girl at least three times before I'll even consider having dinner with her.",Barney
"What are you doing here? Oh, God! You're dating one of my students. It's Rachel, isn't it? Barney, I know she wears provocative sweaters, but she's 19! Now I'm gonna have to hear all about it, right? Go on, tell me every detail.",Ted
"No, you pent-up old perv. I brought you a present. Recognize this?",Barney
It's my building.,Ted
"Do you remember how awesome it was to be co-workers... Nay, bro-workers?",Barney
Wait a minute. Y-You don't mean...,Ted
"Ted Mosby, it's back on. We're gonna build your building.",Barney
"This is awesome... You're designing our new headquarters. Now, there will be voices that tell you a hockey rink on the roof is unfeasible. You've got to shut those voices out.",Marshall
"Actually, I think I'm gonna say no.",Ted
No? Are you kidding me?,Robin
But designing a building in New York City is your lifelong dream.,Lily
"I do not want to work for GNB again. Those guys are evil. No offense, Marshall.",Ted
"Dude, none taken. Yes, GNB is, the Empire from Star Wars. But the Death Star's gonna get built either way. And don't you think the architect of the Death Star is pretty psyched to have that thing on his space resume? I mean, yes, his design was flawed in the sense that a single b*llet fired into a particular vent would explode the whole thing.",Marshall
"For all we know, that was the contractor's fault.",Ted
"But that won't happen on your watch... you know why? Because you're Ted Mosby! And you are gonna design the most beautiful, ventless, Rebel-proof building in Manhattan, with clearly marked emergency stops for every trash compactor on the detention level.",Marshall
"Look, I know this is hard to understand, but right now, I have a quiet, simple, happy little life. And I like it that way. I know what my answer has to be.",Ted
"I can't take the job, Barney. I'm done with that life. No hard feelings?",Ted
Of course not.,Barney
All right.,Ted
"I'm telling you, no architect would ever design a giant exposed vent right over a Death Star's core reactor. That's Space Architecture 101. It had to be the contractor. Barney, back me up. Barney. Dude, this is important.",Ted
I need another drink.,Barney
"Marshall, you want anything?",Ted
"No, I'm fine.",Marshall
"Okay, I get that he's mad at me for turning down the job, but acting like I'm not even here?",Ted
"Wait, you turned down the job? When?",Marshall
This morning.,Ted
"That's so weird. Just, like, an hour ago, when we were leaving work...",Marshall
"So, you still think Ted's gonna take the job?",Marshall
Please. I'll get the yes. Barney Stinson always gets the yes.,Barney
Am I wrong or is that exactly what Barney says when he's putting the moves on a girl?,Ted
"Exactly. I mean, it's almost like he's putting the moves on you.",Marshall
"Yeah, more like the opposite. He's been ignoring me all night. Barney wants me to take the job so bad he's putting the moves on me?",Ted
"I hope that's his end game. Actually, I don't. I like you two together.",Marshall
"I don't buy it. That's crazy, even for Barney.",Ted
"Okay, well, think about it. We've seen his moves countless times. What does he do after he's done ignoring a girl?",Marshall
"Chrissy, I love your glasses.",Barney
Really?,Chrissy
They totally pull focus up from that whole chin situation you got going on. To Chrissy.,Barney
The backhanded compliment to lower her self-esteem... a proven winner.,Marshall
But Barney hasn't done...,Ted
"Ted, I admire your loyalty. You've had that hairstyle forever. You don't care that it's out of fashion or that it's been co-opted by the lesbian community. You stick with it. To Ted.",Barney
"Hey, Lily!",Robin
"Don't Hey, Lily me. I smelled poop all the way from the hallway.",Lily
"Oh, no, not this again.",Robin
"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
"Okay, I left Don another message.",Robin
This just in is what I'm gonna say when I'm stabbing you.,Robin
But that's impossible. You deleted his number.,Lily
"I tried to. But then this thing popped up on my phone that said, Are you sure? And I wasn't sure. I can't lie to my phone.",Robin
"Oh, sweetie, I totally understand. Delete it!",Lily
"It's not that easy, okay? You're not just deleting a number, you're deleting a part of your life. You know, all those memories, all those experiences. It's like you're admitting they're gone forever.",Robin
"I know, sweetie. I know. Delete it!",Lily
"Okay, if it's that easy, I'm gonna delete one of your numbers from your phone, see how you like it.",Robin
"My plezh. If you can find a number in there that I don't call regularly, I'll gladly delete it.",Lily
Super Kicks Karate.,Robin
"No, not that one. That's my dojo.",Lily
You have a dojo?,Robin
I took an introductory karate class.,Lily
"Ops, wrong room. Where do the grown-ups go for the real karate class?",Lily
"What's the matter, lady? You scared?",Boy
Of you? Please. I'm a kindergarten teacher.,Lily
I hated kindergarten. All three times.,Boy
But I'm totally gonna sign up for more lessons.,Lily
How long ago did you take that class?,Robin
"I don't know. It was around the time when everyone was going, Wassuuuuuuup!",Lily
"How do you even remember that? Lily, this is a number that you will never dial again.",Robin
I might.,Lily
"No, no. But you keep it in your phone because it reminds you of a version of yourself that you could be, even if it's a version of yourself that you'll never become. And that's okay.",Robin
"No, it's not. Okay, you know what? There, gone. Your move, Scherbatsky.",Lily
I finally know what your kind goes through. I get it now.,Ted
"For the last time, I don't care how big it was, it is not the same as giving birth.",Robin
No! Barney's been putting the moves on Ted.,Marshall
"Oh, that sucks. Although I like you two together.",Lily
"No, he's been doing it to try to get Ted to design the new GNB Tower.",Marshall
Which moves are we talking about? Did he do the thing where he brags on himself in the form of a complaint?,Robin
"Man, every time I take out my business card and women see the GNB logo, they throw themselves at me. I miss the chase. It sucks!  Man, the courtside Knicks seats that are available to all upper level GNB employees are too close to the action. I keep getting sweat on my suit. It sucks!  Man, GNB's benefits package is so comprehensive it gives me the freedom to see any doctor I want. It sucks!",Barney
He did.,Ted
And the intense eye contact thing?,Robin
"So, Ted, would you like to split some jalapeno poppers?",Barney
Okay. Yep.,Ted
And the thing where he establishs intimacy through physical contact?,Robin
You know why jalapeno poppers are so good? It's the cream cheese.,Ted
That is so true.,Barney
Yeah... Cream cheese has a mild flav-flavor so it... it balances out the spiciness of the jal... the spiciness of the... Dude!,Ted
"So at any point in this did you say, Barney, I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. I am not taking that job?",Robin
"Well, I mean, not exactly in those...",Ted
You're loving this.,Lily
No.,Ted
You are. You're loving the attention.,Lily
"It's nice to be wanted, okay? And, yes, this is a new vest. Thank you all for noticing. Oh, that's right, you didn't. Barney did!",Ted
"Oh, Teddy, you are so going to spread your legs and design that building.",Robin
I am not that kind of architect. So get this...,Ted
Robin never deleted Don's number.,Lily
"Oh, everyone thinks it's so easy. Give me your phone. Let's delete one of yours.",Robin
"Okay. No problem. If you can find a number that I don't need or shouldn't have in here, be my guest, but good luck. I keep my phone tight.",Marshall
Edwin.,Robin
"Oh, no, not that one. That's the booker for the club that my band plays at. You know, my all-lawyer funk band... you remember... The Funk, the Whole Funk and Nothing but the Funk.",Marshall
You guys played one gig four years ago. I'm deleting it.,Robin
"No, no, we're gonna... we're gonna play another gig again. Probably really soon. It's just we all got super busy, and... We're not going to play another gig again, are we?",Marshall
"Probably not, baby.",Lily
"See, it's hard to hit that delete button, isn't it?",Robin
"Well, it's just that without that number in my phone, I'm just a corporate lawyer working 60 very un-funky hours a week.",Marshall
"Sorry, Marshall. But if I have to, you have to.",Robin
Okay. Your turn.,Lily
"Barney, I gotta tell you something.",Ted
"Oh, that reminds me. I got you a little airplane. It represents the spirit of adventure. Do you like it, Ted? Do you?",Barney
Stop it. Stop looking at me like I'm the only person in the world who matters. I'm not designing the GNB Tower.,Ted
"Yeah, I know. You turned it down. We hired someone else.",Barney
"Can you believe it? He's resorting to the oldest move in the book. The classic, pretend to take the offer off the table so I'll want it more. It's so obvious, right? As if that's going to make me be like, Oh, God, I never should have said no.",Ted
"It's not a move, dude. I executed the paperwork for the new architect this morning. Barney wasn't lying.",Marshall
"Oh, God, I never should have said no! Come on, GNB didn't really hire a new architect. This is just one of Barney's moves.",Ted
"It's not a move, dude. The senior partners were getting impatient. I thought you didn't even want the job.",Marshall
I didn't! I don't! I don't. I don't!,Ted
"Okay, I'll do it!",Ted
"What? Ted, it's too late.",Barney
I'll design it for half of what you're paying the other architect. And you know I will do stuff they would never do. Lobby stuff.,Ted
"Wow, half? Ted, on behalf of Goliath National Bank...",Barney
"Okay, it's a move.",Marshall
What?,Ted
Dude!,Barney
"There is no other architect. I'm sorry, I'm sorry I lied. I was being Barney's wingman, and I never get to be the wingman.",Marshall
You guys lied to me?,Ted
You're the world's worst wingman. You know what? I'm out of here.,Barney
I can do better. Take me back. You son of a bitch!,Marshall
"Look, I can't do business with people who lie to me.",Ted
We only lied to you to make you realize that you want this job.,Barney
"No, I don't. I mean, I know I said I did, but that's only because I fell for the same creepy, pickup artist voodoo of yours that countless women...",Ted
236.,Barney
"...before me fell for. Wow, respect.",Ted
"No... Ted... you want to do this, okay? You're just scared of getting hurt again. But you can't let fear steal your funk. That is good. There is a song in there. Excuse me.",Marshall
"Come on, Ted! This is your dream.",Barney
"No, it's not. Not anymore. And you know what? Letting go of that dream was the best decision I ever made. You guys actually think I have some lingering itch to be an architect? Work 20 hours a day and weekends? To get ulcers and pull my hair out and worry and doubt myself and then at the end of it all, have the rug pulled out from under me? I love being a professor, okay? All that stupid crap they tell you about how fulfilling teaching is? It's all true. I'm happy, and I'm not letting go of that. My answer's no.",Ted
"Hey, guys.",Robin
"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
"How do you do that? You are like a b*mb dog, except with poop. You are a poop-sniffing dog.",Robin
I think that's just called a dog.,Marshall
"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
Fine. I called Don again.,Robin
"Hey, Don! It's Robin again. Look, I am sorry for all the calls. It's just, I saw you on the news, and it made me a little crazy for a minute. I guess I wasn't as over our breakup as I thought. But I want to say, from the bottom of my heart, I am going to k*ll you. No... No, I'm not. I am happy for you. And that Asian slut on your Facebook page. She's dead, too.",Robin
I thought you deleted his number.,Lily
"I did, but it turns out, I memorized it. You can't delete contacts from your brain, Lily.",Robin
"Well, you have to try. If you ever want to have closure...",Lily
"I am never going to have closure. Okay? Closure doesn't exist. Okay, one day, Don and I are moving in together, and the next thing I know, he's on a plane to Chicago. It just... ended. And no matter how much I try to forget that it happened, it will have never not happened. Don and I will always be a loose end. We'll always be...",Robin
"Unfinished. Gaudi, to his credit, never gave up on his dream, but that's not usually how it goes. I mean, usually, it isn't a speeding bus that keeps the brown, pointy, weird church from getting built. Most of the time, it's just too difficult or too expensive, or too scary. It's only once you've stopped that you realize how hard it is to start again. So you force yourself not to want it. But it's always there. And until you finish it, it will always be...",Ted
"Hey, Barney. Hey, Rachel. Rachel, why aren't you in class?",Ted
Why aren't you in class?,Rachel
"Yeah, Ted. Why aren't you in class? You son of a bitch. I'll call Marshall. We'll draw up the contract.",Barney
Not so fast. I'm not that easy.,Ted
Bueno?,Voice
Who is this?,Robin
No hablo ingles. Quien es?,Voice
"I'm sorry. Is this 917-456... I'm sorry, 465... No, wait.",Robin
Sorry. Wrong number. Finished with that.,Robin
"Hey, punk! Bit of advice. Next time you step on a kindergarten teacher's neck, you better finish the job.",Lily
I knew this day would come.,Man
I cannot stop staring at that girl's face.,Barney
Face. Huh. That's your weirdest nickname for boobs yet.,Ted
"No, Ted, I'm really looking at her face.",Barney
Aw... That's actually really sweet.,Lily
"Puffy cheeks, smudged mascara, slightly red nose... That girl was just crying. She's so sad and defenseless. Anyone have a condom?",Barney
"Oh! Oh, God! No, no, no!",Everyone
That's it! You know what? Five-minute time-out! Corner booth! Now.,Lily
"Hey, get this. You know my friend Max from law school? He's at Gregor's Steakhouse downtown, and Woody Allen is sitting two tables over. He wants us to come check it out.",Marsall
"I don't know, it could be cool. I've never seen Woody Allen.",Robin
"What?! Robin, how can you be a New Yorker and never have seen Woody Allen?",Marsall
I have seen plenty of other famous people. Last week I saw... Maury Povich.,Robin
"Dude, everyone sees Maury Povich.",Lily
"Maury Povich is everywhere. I'm sorry, Robin, but you're not a real New Yorker until you've seen Woody Allen.",Marsall
"I am, too, a real New Yorker.",Robin
That's adorable. You're from Canada.,Ted
I have been here for almost six years. It's not like I just got off a boat.,Robin
"A boat! Oh, wait, that is how you say it.",Lily
I'd say you're not a real New Yorker until you've stolen a cab from someone who needs it more than you do.,Ted
"No, you're not a real New Yorker till you've cried on the subway and not given a damn what anyone thinks.",Lily
"No, you're not a real New Yorker until you've k*ll a cockroach with your bare hands.",Marshall
"Those rules are all stupid, okay? I've never done any of those things.",Robin
"Okay, time's up. What are we talking about?",Barney
"Woody Allen is eating at Gregor's, and Robin thinks that we should go see him.",Marshall
Why would I do that? I'll see him at poker on Tuesday.,Barney
"Oh, come on, if we jump in a cab, we'll be there in 15 minutes.",Robin
"A real New Yorker would know the subway's faster. You just take the one, and transfer to the two-three.",Lily
"Well, the bus runs more often on weekends. Take the M-7 to the M-5.",Ted
"The bus? Every time I take the bus, there is one crazy person no one wants to sit near. That's why I have never taken the bus. Plus... I can run faster than a bus.",Barney
"Dude, that's, like, seven miles. You can't do that. You can't b*at the bus!",Ted
I can b*at a bus or a cab or a train!,Marshall
Is anyone else suddenly craving green eggs and ham?,Robin
"Machines are overrated, and someone needs to take them down a peg.",Marshall
"You're all wrong... I got a way to get there so fast, I could b*at all of you, even if I sat down and ordered a big, juicy steak first.",Barney
How?,Marshall
"Medium rare. But that's not important right now. Look, I know the city better than any of you guys, okay?",Barney
"Oh, my God!",Lily
"Oh, wow!",Barney
"All right, all right, hold on, hold on! Let's just forget about it. Who cares? I mean, there's no way to find out who's right anyway. First person there wins! ",Ted
(,Barney
"Hi. Can I see a menu, please? No rush.",Barney
"It's gonna be positive. Eriksen man are hella fertile. When Uncle Morris was 16, he got his girlfriend pregnant just by holding her hand too tight in the backseat of a car. Now I'm thinking my parents lied to me.",Marshall
Negative.,Lily
"Negative? Well, we know it's not me.",Marshall
Everything's fine. These things take time.,Lily
"Not with an Eriksen. Something must be wrong with you. Also, my mom hates you.",Marshall
"You know what? Just to make sure, I'm gonna pee on this again.",Lily
"What? No, you wouldn't. Somebody help me! Somebody help me!",Marshall
Idiot!,Man
I'll show them. My body can outrun any motorized vehicle. I'm like John Henry when he b*at the steam engine. All I need is a great folk song.,Marshall
"Suck it, grand-butt!",Marshall
"Ooh, taxi!",Robin
"Excuse me, I got a thing.",Man
Maury... Maury...,Speaker
Track maintenance? 20-minute delay?,Lily
How do you do that?,Man
"I grew up here, I speak conductor. Damn it! ",Lily
Grademyteacher.net?,Ted
"It's this awesome site where students can go say what they really think about their professors. Hey, you're probably on there.",Marshall
Here's a fun fact. See the Alberta Building over there?,Ted
Oh. The brown one or the gray one?,Man
That's the gray one. Did you know that in 18...,Ted
Hey! Come on! Elizabeth!,Barney
Somebody call an ambulance!,Waiter
"Excuse me, I've got a thing.",Robin
Hey! That's my cab!,Woman
"Gregor's Steakhouse, downtown.",Robin
nan,Woman
"Downtown hospital, please. It's right by Gregor's Steakhouse. Take the FDR, and maybe crank up some smooth jazz.",Barney
"Uh, we're required by law to take you to the nearest hospital, which is St. Luke's-Roosevelt. Uptown.",Medic
"Oh, no. ",Barney
Hi! I'm Becky!,Becky
Hi.,Robin
I am so excited to be your coanchor! Yay!,Becky
"Hi, Becky. My, you're perky.",Robin
"Don't worry, I am not here to step on your toesies.",Becky
Oh...,Robin
You're still the star. I made chocolate chip cookies for everybody! Yay!,Becky
This is my cab! Aah!,Woman
Keep it.,Robin
Hello.,Ranjit
"Ranjit, take me to Gregor's.",Barney
Taking you to Gregor's.,Ranjit
"Hey, Christine.",Marshall
Last seat. Thank God. I just had the worst cab ride of my life.,Woman
"Well, you're in luck. See that gothic church over there? Those corinthian columns were designed by Giuseppe Pegatto in 1896. ",Ted
"Hey, Ranjit, pull over.",Barney
Pulling over.,Ranjit
"Hey, toots! How about a ride? Oh. Hey, Robin, it's you.",Barney
See that over there? That's the old Arcadian Hotel. Fun fact... While today its neoclassical fenestration is considered to be... (,Ted
"So, is this ride your way of apologizing for this morning?",Robin
I'm sorry. I never apologize. And why would I?,Barney
Are you kidding me?,Robin
"Hey, Barney, can I talk to you?",Robin
Sure. Stand a little more this way. I'm scouting some talent. Pretend we're talking about something important.,Barney
"Oh, well, this... This is something important. Um, I'm having a... A really rough time at work. You know, the whole Becky thing...",Robin
"Oh, you know what? That's just getting distracting. Um, say carrots and peas. Carrots and peas. Guys, I can't stop staring at that girl's face.",Barney
"What, you really had something to talk about?",Barney
"Yes. Look, I've spent the last,six years in this city, focusing on my career, all for nothing. Some lady almost got me k*ll. Maury Povich stole my cab. I swear, this city is starting to reject me like a bad organ transplant. You know, everyone keeps saying that I'm not a real New Yorker. Well, maybe I should just stop trying.",Robin
"Robin, I had no idea.",Barney
"No, it's my fault for thinking that you might care. Ranjit, stop the car.",Robin
Stopping the car.,Ranjit
"No, don't stop the car.",Barney
Not stopping the car.,Ranjit
"Seriously, stop the car.",Robin
Seriously stopping the car.,Ranjit
"Look, you... Wait, wait... Robin, hold on. If you want to talk, I'm right here.",Barney
Carrots and peas.,Robin
Don't... You...,Barney
I'll crank up the smooth jazz.,Ranjit
Uses a hybrid steel tube structure...,Ted
Whoa! This is crazy.,Marshall
I can't believe it.,Robin
"Okay, this is clearly a sign. Let's just call it a tie. Forget about the race. Head back to the bar.",Ted
"Oh, God. Oh, bite me!",Robin
Faster. Mush! Mush! I need this win. I need this win.,Barney
"And firing half my department freed up the money to double my own salary. And this chick from Boston was wicked hot in bed last night, and I'm getting more muscular, even though I've stopped working out, and I've got this amazing poker group.",Barney
"And I smell incredible. Smell me. Just, seriously, smell me.",Barney
Stop! Too slow. Switch.,Barney
Sweetie? Are you okay?,Lily
No. I am done with this city. It wins. I just want to move somewhere new and start over.,Robin
"You've had a rough year. But you're tough. And I love you like crazy. If you left, I'd have to follow you. And Marshall would follow me. And Ted would follow him. The only upside is that we might get rid of Barney. Bring it in.",Lily
What did he say?,Robin
"No clue. Hey, is that Maury Povich?",Lily
Hey! Lily.,Robin
"Sorry, sweetie. I swear I'll be a great friend at the finish line, but the conductor just said you're going express to Borough Hall, which means you're screwed, sweetie. So long, sucker",Lily
"And not a single passenger would listen to me. I mean, am I a bad teacher? Do I just put people to sleep?",Ted
The machines have won! he machines have won.,Marshall
"Dude, mellow.",Man
I can't do it. I can't run that far. I can't outrace anything. I... I can't... I can't get my wife pregnant!,Marshall
Wait. Is that what this whole stupid running thing has been about?,Ted
"My body has been letting me down, and I just wanted to prove that it could still do something, but it can't.",Marshall
"Dude, you've been trying for two months, not two years. That's nothing.",Ted
"Well, you should talk. You know, you're the one who's freaking out because you have one mediocre review and, like, 50 great ones.",Marshall
64. But whatever.,Ted
"And you're designing a frickin' building. I mean, come on, dude.",Marshall
"Sounds like you guys need to clear everything, subtract the negativity, and add some perspective.",Man
"Marshall! Marshall, get in!",Lily
Hello.,Ranjit
There it is.,Ted
Where are Marshall and lily?,Robin
Who cares?,Barney
I won? I won!,Robin
No!,Barney
I can't believe I won!,Robin
How did that even happen?,Barney
"Okay, he's in. Go. Go. g*n it.",Lily
Ted is in the way.,Ranjit
Run him over.,Lily
Running him over.,Ranjit
"No. Lily, what the hell is the matter with you?",Marshall
Nothing. I just want to win this really badly. So badly that I just ditched my best friend when she needed me.,Lily
"Oh, baby, you were also going to run over Ted.",Marshall
Why did I get so crazy about this?,Lily
"Maybe for the same reason that I kept saying that I could run seven miles. I... I'm trying to be really, um, confident and positive about all this, but, baby, I'm really scared that we're not pregnant yet.",Marshall
"Oh, thank God. I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.",Lily
I keep thinking there's something wrong with me.,Marshall
It's only been two months.,Lily
We are crazy.,Marshall
We're totally crazy.,Lily
This is the last time it's ever going to be just the two of us. Shouldn't we be enjoying that?,Marshall
We gotta go back to Paris.,Lily
And take ballroom dancing.,Marshall
And really learn how to ski. Not just up and get faced in the lodge.,Lily
"And see Coney Island. I've still never been. See, we have a whole bucket list of things to do before we start having kids.",Marshall
"Oh, a cradle list.",Lily
"I'm... So glad we're trying, and I'm going to be really excited for when it happens, but this isn't a race.",Marshall
It isn't a race.,Lily
"Ranjit, screw Gregor's. Let's go to Coney Island.",Marshall
Screwing Gregor's. Going to Coney Island.,Ranjit
I won!,Robin
No!,Barney
"So I said, the cab, of course",Robin
I know what you did back there.,Ted
"Yeah. Check it. I just drove a pedicab 26 blocks, and I still smell incredible. Smell me.",Barney
I'm not gonna... Not gonna...,Ted
Smell me.,Barney
"Wait a minute. So, where is Woody Allen?",Robin
He's right there.,Max
"Damn it, Max. That's Maury Povich.",Robin
I always get those two confused.,Max
"I love your idea about a giant rooftop ring of fire you can jump through with a motorcycle, but I tweaked it slightly and... This is still super bad-ass. It's now a patio garden where you can bring a nice bag lunch.",Ted
Sick. Yeah. Dude. Working together is gonna be legen... Wait for it. I'll send you an inter-office memo with the rest 'cause we freakin' work together!,Barney
"Oh, big news. The board finally settled on a site for the building.",Barney
"Uh, no, thank you. Still got it.",Ted
"Barney, we have to talk.",Ted
Sure. What's up?,Barney
"Not now, Trish!",Barney
Dary.,Ted
"Legendary! So, what's on your mind?",Barney
I can't design the building.,Ted
"Oh, yeah.",Marshall
"Oh, baby. No, no. Not the slipper socks with the rubber soles. I work so hard to-to set the mood, and-and when I see those, I feel the egg go right back up my Fallopian tube.",Lily
"Baby, these satin sheets are slippery. Papa needs traction.",Marshall
Traction?,Lily
"As you know, Papa likes to get down with enthusiasm.",Marshall
Please stop calling yourself Papa.,Lily
"And without traction, Papa's likely to boogie himself right out of bed. It's either these or soccer cleats.",Marshall
"Hey, so I talked to Robin. I guess she and Max hooked up last night.",Lily
Nice! I love that guy. Max is both his name and his level of awesomeness.,Marshall
"Yeah. He's a sweet guy. She feels really comfortable with him. They bonded over hockey. I guess he has a small penis, but they want to double-date next weekend.",Lily
Why would you tell me that?,Marshall
So you'll clear your schedule.,Lily
No! The other part!,Marshall
"Oh, the small penis thing?",Lily
Ah! Don't! Stop saying that! Why do you keep saying that? You... I don't want to know that. I'm not going to be able to look the guy in the eye. I'm certainly not going to be able to call him Max.,Marshall
"That's insane. I mean, just because you know Max has a small penis...",Lily
Just don't!,Marshall
You're kidding me.,Barney
"I'm sorry. I can't do this if it means tearing down The Arcadian. It's an architectural landmark. Plus, people live there. How does GNB plan to get hundreds of residents to just up and leave?",Ted
Snakes.,Barney
Did you just say snakes?,Ted
"I don't recall saying snakes. Ted, I know you love crappy old stuff no one cares about. But I'm gonna give you four words to live by: New is always better.",Barney
New is always better?,Ted
You know who's a million times hotter than the hottest girl I've ever slept with? Her okay-looking friend I haven't seen naked. Why? Because new is always better.,Barney
Mm-hmm? And this theory applies to everything?,Ted
Everything.,Barney
"So, those new Star Wars movies... Those are better than the old ones?",Ted
Yeah. The first three barely mention the intricacies of intergalactic trade law.,Barney
"And when you're at a g*n n' Roses concert, you're like, Yeah, yeah, Paradise City, whatever. When are they gonna rock me some Chinese Democracy?",Ted
"Axl's really matured as a songwriter, Ted.",Barney
Wendy! I'd like to buy my friend a drink. What's your oldest Scotch?,Ted
"Glenmckenna, aged 30 years in oak casks.",Wendy
Amazing. And what's your newest scotch?,Ted
Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch. Don't let it touch your skin.,Wendy
"Your call, buddy.",Ted
"A glass of the J-Jumbo Jim's Grape Scotch sounds lovely. Lots of ice. New is always better, Ted! That's a rule. Just like bigger is always better!",Barney
"Pff. That's not true. Uh, sometimes smaller is better. Hey, look how big my cell phone is! You don't hear people say that. No. You want something compact and efficient that fits comfortably in your pocket, and I think Max is just a great guy.",Marshall
Lily told you.,Robin
Told him what?,Ted
Max has a small penis.,Lily
How can you speak of such things?,Barney
Girls talk about everything.,Robin
"Size, shape, left or right leaning orientation...",Lily
"Length, resemblance to a historical figure, such as Winston Churchill... Yes, that's one of you. Girth, grooming...",Robin
How can you speak of such things?,Barney
"You're kidding. Barney, every time I mention a woman you don't know, the first thing you say is, Boobs? Not the complete sentence, Does she have big boobs? Which also would not be great. Just: Boobs?",Lily
I do not do that.,Barney
My friend Lori from work...,Lily
Boobs? Damn it. But... seriously. Boobs?,Barney
"So why is it okay for guys to talk about boobs, but the moment we bring up a topic like Max's small penis... I'm gonna pretend this conversation never happened.",Lily
Impossible. Max's penis is stuck in my brain like a splinter. Like a splinter-sized splinter.,Marshall
"Speaking of disappointing weenies... Ted, tell them what you told me.",Barney
I want to ask the board at GNB to move the site for the new headquarters so we don't have to tear down a classic old building.,Ted
"I still don't get this. Why, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, do you want to ruin... Wait a minute. Who's the girl?",Barney
Duh. Of course there's a girl.,Robin
What? I... There's no g-girl. Why would you even... Her name is Zoey.,Ted
Boobs?,Barney
"Beautiful building, right?",Woman
"Look, mister, you are very convincing, and I am very flattered. Confused, even. But I'm not looking...",Ted
I'm not a drag queen. But you definitely have me rethinking this eye shadow.,Woman
"Not only is she funny, hot and genetically female, but get this...",Ted
"Look at the Palladian windows, the rusticated stonework, the marble cornices...",Woman
She's an architecture nerd! A hot architecture nerd! That's the dream!,Ted
Whose dream?,Barney
We wound up talking for hours.,Ted
I love how old parts of the city are. Hmm. It makes me feel connected to history.,Woman
Old is always better. I can't wait to be old.,Ted
"Me, too. You can wear elastic everything. Your lipstick doesn't have to stay inside the lines.",Woman
You can shoplift and pretend you're just confused.,Ted
You could nap anywhere. Uh-huh. Even while driving. It's gonna be great. I can't wait to be all run-down and weathered and wrinkly.,Woman
"Well, I'd say you got a pretty long wait.",Ted
"That's sweet. It would be sweeter if you hadn't thought I was a tr*nny before, but it's still sweet.",Woman
"Oh, Ted, that's so romantic. I want to fill a pillowcase with dead batteries and b*at you with it.",Barney
"Hey, Ted, can I ask you something",Woman
Anything.,Ted
Will you sign this petition? Save The Arcadian We are gonna stop the bastards at Goliath National Bank from demolishing it. Will you support us?,Woman
And you said...?,Barney
Where do I sign?,Ted
"Hmm. Grape scotch. Not bad. Ted, you only think The Arcadian needs to be saved because some pretty girl thinks that. And seriously... Boobs?",Barney
This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.,Ted
"And what did this Zoey say when she found out that you're the one tearing down her beloved Arcadian? That you, Ted Mosby, are the Architect Of Destruction?",Barney
Whoa! Sweet wrestling name alert.,Marshall
"Well... Uh, it's a... it's a funny thing about that...",Ted
"So what do you do, Ted?",Zoey
I'm a veterinarian.,Ted
What? I panicked!,Ted
This whole Arcadian thing is classic Mosby. Changing your personality to fit some girl.,Barney
I don't do that.,Ted
"Well, off to meet Steph. We're adrenaline junkies! Penelope is taking me to the Battle of Gettysburg. We're gonna eat squirrel!  (",Ted
Aww! Come on! Come on! We all change a little for whoever we're into. Barney pretended to be a rabbi to get laid.,Ted
Asian girls love them some Jews.,Barney
And Marshall never would've listened to The Indigo Girls if it weren't for Lily.,Ted
"Um, I think you got that backwards there, Chief.",Lily
And you're welcome.,Marshall
"The point is, you weren't pretending to like the Indigo Girls for the other person. You realized you liked them because of the other person. Just like me, Zoey and The Arcadian. Did GNB really put snakes in The Arcadian?",Ted
"No. Technically, they were eggs.",Barney
Did you just say eggs?,Ted
I don't recall saying eggs.,Barney
"So I walk into my boss's office and suddenly I realize, Holy crap, I'm about to quit",Max
"Yeah, I-I think it is so cool that you started your own law firm.",Robin
"Well, right now it's a pretty small practice.",Max
"Hey, hey. I bet it's not that small.",Marshall
"Bro, it's... pretty small.",Max
"Yeah, but, uh, you know what they say. The important thing is-is how you use it, you know? The motion of the ocean. That whole thing.",Marshall
"He said it's small, Marshall, and everybody's fine with that. Let's just move on.",Robin
I'm just saying that I bet it's bigger than he thinks. And thick.,Marshall
"Nah. Everything about it is tiny. The office is tiny. The conference room is tiny. Plus, I got a very small staff.",Max
Let's order!,Robin
Zoey... I'm Batman. Hmm. That'd be cool.,Ted
I need your help. ,Zoey
Wasn't expecting bunnies.,Ted
"I stole them, Ted. My animal rights group liberated these guys from an evil cosmetics company. And I figured, Hey, Ted's a vet. He can check them out and make sure they're okay.",Zoey
Absolutely. Just let me run up and get my bag of vet supplies. Okay. Why would I say that?,Ted
"Well, I know what I'm getting.Oh? Oh?The porterhouse. I've had it here before. It is like this. It's huge.",Max
"Well, spare no expense, buddy. Dinner is on me, and-and get dessert. Maybe this molten chocolate lava cake? I just want you to be happy.",Marshall
"Thanks, man. Next time, it is on me. Aw. Excuse me. I'll be right back. All right.",Max
Totally.,Robin
We'll just be here. ,Marshall
"Ah. Thanks, bro. It's, uh.... it's going on a while.",Max
I know.,Marshall
Thanks.,Max
"Damn, baby, be cool!",Lily
You're acting like he has six months to live.,Robin
It's your fault! You ladies and your salty sailor talk!,Marshall
"Oh, come on! What about you men and your locker room talk?",Robin
Locker room talk. Do you want to know what it's like in a men's locker room?,Marshall
It's just a bunch of uncomfortable dudes trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. And one old guy just letting it all hang out.,Marshall
Are you suggesting that guys don't talk about sex?,Lily
"Yes, we do, but you know what we say? I hit that.I got some.I tapped it. I squeezed those. Discreet and efficient.",Marshall
Not to mention classy.,Robin
"Thank God that I'm not dating. If I thought that Lily talked in that much detail about our sex life, I'd probably k*ll myself. Oh, no. What did you tell her?",Marshall
"Oh, nothing. We don't talk about you!",Lily
Are you sure?,Marshall
Yeah. That argument has no traction whatsoever.,Robin
You just broke in and stole these guys? Aren't you worried about getting arrested?,Ted
Nah. I've been arrested lots of times. Chinese Democracy.,Zoey
Wow. You're a little bit crazy.,Ted
"Well, I'm usually crazy for a good cause. I can't just sit by while voiceless people or animals, r even buildings et screwed over. 'm certainly not going o just sit by hile GNB turns The Arcadian nto a soulless metal box.",Zoey
"Yeah. Yeah. Although I hear there's a lovely rooftop patio where folks can enjoy a nice bag lunch, so...",Ted
"Ted, I will find the bastards at GNB responsible for this, and I promise you, I will take them down.",Zoey
"Ted, this woman is an anarchist, a sociopath, a lunatic, and for the love of God, boobs?!",Barney
"Solid C-cup, perky bounce.",Ted
Momentary grudging respect.,Barney
"Zoey does what she believes is right, and I want to do the same thing. We have to find a new site for this building.",Ted
"Ted, that is never gonna happen.",Barney
"Well, I can't tear down The Arcadian. I'm sorry, but I'm off the project.",Ted
"Hey, guys! I appreciate the great turnout, but just so we're all on the same page, this is not a rally to legalize marijuana.",Zoey
"Oh, bummer!",Man
Hey.,Ted
"Hey, Ted. I'm so glad you came.",Zoey
"Well, you really got to me the other night. I want to get involved with Save The Arcadian.",Ted
"Great. I'll grab you a picket sign. Hmm. Do you want GNB puts the douche in fiduciary.....or It's always 4:20 somewhere? Dudes, you forgot your signs!",Zoey
"Ted, everything okay? Yea... um... um... You work for GNB?",Zoey
"Dude, why are you dressed like a wizard?",Man
"She was really hot, okay?",Ted
How the hell could you do that?,Ted
Simple. I rented the chair. The bunny was here already. That was lucky. I waited to do the dramatic swivel until I heard your key enter the door.,Barney
"The billboard, Barney.",Ted
"I had to. Now that you have no sh*t with the girl, you'll realize you never cared about the building, and everything can go back to normal.",Barney
You're wrong. I do care. And I'm still quitting.,Ted
"Don't you get it, Ted? We're tearing down The Arcadian either way. It's a stupid old piece-of-crap, run-down, snake-infested dump!",Barney
"Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?!",Ted
Who mentioned snakes?! And stop shouting! You're scaring Cottontail.,Barney
You named the rabbit?,Ted
"You took longer to get here than I thought, we bonded, I'm keeping her. The point is, you now have a chance to design your own building. Dude, you can do whatever you want with it.",Barney
You're right. You're right. I can design it however I want.,Ted
So you're back in?,Barney
Yeah.,Ted
"Ugh, he thinks I like this...But it feels disgusting.",Lily
"Uh, it looks disgusting.",Robin
"Uh, is this working for you?",Marshall
"Uh, is this working for you?",Lily
"Oh, of course, because what woman doesn't like being slobbered on while some giant paws at her nether regions like Lenny from Of Mice and Men?",Robin
"Oh, you're bad.",Lily
More Cosmos?,Robin
I can't... I can't do this! I can't stop thinking about you and Robin!,Marshall
"Oh, I've had that a couple times. Just lean into it and let it fuel things.",Lily
"Look, no. You know what? Why don't you just... Why don't you just call Robin, okay, and have a good laugh about it? Whoa! Traction could have prevented that.",Marshall
"Well, hope you don't mind, we made some changes to the billboard.",Zoey
"Well, that explains a few voicemails. Listen, Zoey, I think we can save The Arcadian. No. Maybe not in the way you were picturing, but I stayed up all night working on a new concept, all right? What if my design could incorporate The Arcadian's facade into the new GNB headquarters?",Ted
Are you married?,Ted
"Yeah. So you were saying, the facade will be completely preserved?",Zoey
This isn't about the girl. It's about the building.,Ted
"Yeah, it was about the girl.",Ted
"Ted, wh-wh-what are you doing?",Zoey
"This wouldn't work. Zoey, The Arcadian was a really great building once, but it's falling apart, and it's full of snakes.",Ted
Snakes?,Zoey
I don't recall saying snakes.,Ted
"Then he gets this panicked look on his face, says, I can't do this, and storms out.",Lily
"Wow, that is weird.",Robin
But here's the crazier part.,Lily
No. You know what? Papa don't back down from a fight. So why don't you tell Robin... about this!,Marshall
"It was amazing. He was passionate, animalistic, a complete stud.",Lily
"Wow. So he's right there making you say all this, huh?",Robin
"Yup. 'You're like a Greek god, I moaned, as the... I can't read that, baby.",Lily
Musky scent of man.,Marshall
As the musky scent of man and Marshall's sure-footed traction intoxicated and overpowered me.,Lily
That sounds real.,Robin
"Hey, Mosby! You're gonna have to come out of your hole at some point, you son of a bitch! Yeah! Legalize it! Dude! Ready. Aim. Fire!",Zoey
How's it going with Robin?,Marshall
"Uh, I think I have to break up with her.",Max
Really? Why? You with her?,Marshall
"Yeah, well, there's this... kind of weird thing she likes to do in the bedroom.",Max
"Hey, what's not for everyone?",Ted
"Guys, come on. What is it?",Marshall
"Come on, bro. This is a locker room.",Max
"I... What do you think it was, Murray?",Marshall
"So, have you guys landed on a name yet?",Marshall
"We're trying, but it's tougher than you think. You see, I like Tiffany.",Stuart
And I don't want my daughter to have a whore's name.,Claudia
That's my mother's name.,Stuart
I know.,Claudia
"Oh, I got it. How 'bout we name the baby after you-- Frigid Shrew.",Stuart
"Oh, that's good. No, no, no, no. Let's call her Vodka. Then at least we know you'd hold her tight and never let her go!",Claudia
Don't knock the vodka. Wouldn't have a kid without it.,Stuart
"Stuart, you are so... That's not gonna be us, right? I mean, how hard can it be to name a baby?",Marshall
"Right? I mean, just look at her. Yeah. She's clearly a...",Lily
Emily.,Marshall
Lisa.,Lily
Lisa?!,Marshall
Emily?!,Lily
Okay! I made a list of awesome baby names. Starting at the top: number one...,Marshall
"I'm gonna stop you right here, Marshall. You name a chubby white kid LeBron, and he's the one getting stuffed in the basketball hoop.",Ted
"Then I'm also crossing off, um, Shaquille... Mm-hmm. Hakeem, and Dikembe. Hey, what about Rob?",Marshall
Rob? No.,Lily
Why not?,Marshall
"Hey, Rob. What are you gonna make? A turkey?",Lily
"Honka, honka!",Rob
Not Rob.,Lily
"um, how about Ryan?",Marshall
Ooh.,Ted
Not Ryan.,Lily
Johnny?,Marshall
"Hey, where's the goldfish?",Lily
Not Johnny. Or Gil.,Lily
Jeremy.,Marshall
"Jeremy, no!",Lily
Definitely not Jeremy. His stuff was so derivative.,Lily
"Well, I mean, geez, Lily.",Marshall
"Well, whatever you do, do not name your baby Becky, right?",Robin
Why? What?,Marshall
Becky. My new co-anchor? Don't you guys ever watch the show?,Robin
"Oh, honey, I really try.",Lily
Our DVR won't recognize it as a television program.,Marshall
"I watched. Robin insisted I confirm how awful Becky is, so last night I checked it out.",Ted
"Peace talks in the region have been described as, productive. Becky?",Robin
(,Becky
"Becky, we're-we're journalists. We can't get emotional about the news, we...",Robin
"Oh, no! They stole all his money and then pelted him with his own taco meat! Who would do that?",Becky
"Well, if you read the story, we might find out.",Robin
"Oh, can I do this one, about the horse? I love horseys. Mm-hmm. Aww, the horse died. Guys! This news is all really sad.",Becky
"Okay, no holds barred-- what'd you think of Becky?",Robin
Mmm... ,Ted
"You, too? Can somebody please explain to me why the little girl act works on men?",Robin
You want the long version or the short version?,Barney
Short version.,Lily
Short version. Who's your daddy?,Barney
"You know, when you think about that, that phrase is really creepy.",Lily
"No, it's not. It's fun. Here, watch this. Hey, Lily... Who's your daddy?",Marshall
"Okay, uh, let me get this straight. So, in, uh, in this scenario, because you make such sweet love to Lily, she is now your daughter.",Robin
"No, she is not my daughter. I'm just her daddy.",Marshall
Wow. That is disgusting.,Ted
"Exactly. And it's not like the opposite would work. There's no way a guy could pick up a girl, going around talking like a little boy.",Robin
Challenge accepted.,Barney
No.,Robin
"I, Barney Stinson, will pick up a girl whilst talking like a little boy.",Barney
Okay. Here's my list of baby names.,Lily
Oh.,Marshall
What about Tara?,Lily
"No. Not Tara. Tara was the hottest girl in my high school. We were all, like, obsessed with her.",Marshall
We didn't just talk about her and fantasize about her... We wrote songs about her.,Marshall
Not Tara.,Marshall
What about Esther?,Lily
"Gentlemen, gentlemen. Coming up on the main stage, give it up for Esther!",Announcer
"Oh. Oh. Hey, Barney. That prime rib was surprisingly good, but it's 10:30 in the morning. I don't need to see a lady get naked and dance.",Marshall
"Oh, Esther gets naked. But she doesn't dance.",Barney
Then what does she do? Sweet mother nature!,Marshall
That was my card!,Barney
"Gentlemen, gentlemen. Give it up for Esther!",Announcer
Not Esther. I need a drink. Ted? Ted?,Marshall
"Marshall, your list is entirely boy names. You do realize there's roughly a 50% chance of you having a daughter, right?",Ted
"Okay, honestly, I've never thought about having a girl. I don't want to think about having a girl. Tara, Esther -- can you imagine being one of those girls' dads?",Marshall
"Gentlemen, gentlemen. On the main stage, give it up for Marshall's daughter.)",Announcer
"I have no idea how to raise a daughter! What if she makes bad choices? I mean, what if she winds up dating some... Oh, God.",Marshall
I don't want a girl. I just want a little boy.,Marshall
"It's not what it sounds like, folks.",Ted
"Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.",Marshall
Marshall? Is that you?,Judy
"Oh, okay, um... You guys, you're a little too close to the camera. Can you back up a bit?",Marshall
How's this?,Marvin
"Every time. Um, can you just sit in front of the computer like normal human beings? Perfect! Perfect.",Marshall
"What's up, sh**t?",Marvin
"Um, to be honest, I'm getting a little freaked out about the idea of having a daughter. I know you two probably aren't the right people to talk to about this. You had all boys.",Marshall
"Oh, well, that was just dumb luck. Hey, honey, would you get me a brewski from out of the shed?",Marvin
"Sure. You want anything, Marshall?",Judy
"I'm in a computer, Mom.",Marshall
Oh.,Judy
"Yeah, all boys. Total co-winky-dink. It was no co-winky-dink. Since the Viking age, the Eriksen men have passed down ancient secrets for conceiving boys. Number one, avoid lemons. They're baby girl fertilizer.",Marvin
"Okay... No offense, Dad, but I doubt there's any scientific data to support--",Marshall
I doubt there's any scientific data to support.. I had all sons. Your grandfather had all sons. Your great-grandfather had all sons. Scoreboard! Who you gonna listen to? Me? Or scientific data?,Marvin
Members of the G-8 convened today in Vienna to discuss plans to fight climate change by re... What?,Robin
Ask me what I did yesterday.,Becky
"Hey, Becky, Becky, this is our news segment, okay? Nobody cares what you did yesterday.",Robin
"Lighten up, Robin. : What'd you do, sweetheart?",Becky
Mike!,Robin
"Well, I'm new in town and don't know many people. But yesterday, I met the sweetest man, who took me on a tour of the city. ",Becky
"Okay, back to the G-8 conference. Hello? Mike, can I get in the sh*t? Fantastic.",Robin
"Then this cutie patootie took me to this bar called MacLaren's, right underneath his apartment.",Becky
Wait-- did you go out with Ted Mosby?,Robin
"Yes! Guys, I went out with Robin's roommate. I saw her bedroom. ",Becky
"In other news, later today, a Manhattan architect gets punched in the throat.",Robin
Ow!,Ted
"Ted, of all the women in New York, you had to go out with an eight-year-old girl?",Robin
"Not what it sounds like, folks.",Ted
"Ted, you know that I hate her. How could you go out on a date with this girl?",Robin
It wasn't a date. She came over to the apartment looking for you.,Ted
"I made Robin my famous chocolate chip cookies. But instead of chocolate chips, I used gummie bears.",Becky
Aww...,Ted
nan,Becky
"Let me guess: she acted like a helpless little girl, and you stepped in as the big, strong man.",Robin
I don't know if that's totally true.,Ted
"It's okay, little darlin'.",Ted
Poor spider.,Becky
"Hey, hey, hey, hey. Spiders gotta die so trees can grow.",Ted
"Then I held her tight and told her it was all gonna be okay. By the way, I think I only wounded the spider. It crawled off into my bedroom.",Ted
Wait. Is that why you slept on the couch last night?,Robin
(,Ted
I'm dying out here. Talking like a little boy is not working with the ladies.,Barney

"Mm, I just need two seconds, baby.",Marshall
"I know you think that's a compliment, but I'd rather you took your time.",Lily
"No, um... I'll be right back.",Marshall
"Ancient Norse wisdom tells us that, to sire a son, you must do three things right before you lay with your maiden. First, eat pickled herring. Eat it!",Marvin
This is ridiculous. ,Marshall
nan,Barney
"Yeah, we don't care about this...",Robin
"No one challenged you, so it wasn't really a challenge.",Ted
nan,Barney
"Hey, Gerard, what's with that shirt? Nobody could pick up a chick wearing that thing.",Man
Challenge accept...,Barney
"Wow, I'm glad that's over. It was creepy watching Barney talk like a little kid.",Ted
"Oh, but you find it irresistible when Becky does? I don't get it. The Ted that I went out with was attracted to the kind of woman who could use a steak kn*fe without supervision.",Robin
"For your information, Becky doesn't like steak, she likes pasghetti. Spaghetti. And more importantly, she makes me feel needed.",Ted
Needed?  She makes training wheels feel needed.,Robin
"Hey, it's nice to feel needed. And you know what? It's not a feeling guys get when they're with you.",Ted
Son... Viking lore tells us that to ensure the continuation of your noble male lineage... get a big old bowl of ice and dunk your man sack right in there!,Marvin
You two and your football.,Judy
Okay. ,Marshall
"Now get in there, point Lily due north and make me a grandson! Eriksen!",Marvin
Eriksen!,Marshall
"When we were dating, I... I didn't make you feel needed?",Robin
Come on! You always took charge of everything.,Ted
I got this.,Robin
Thanks.,Ted
This okay? Am I hurting y...,Ted
I got this. Whoa!,Robin
Someone's trying to break in-- call the cops.,Ted
I got this.,Robin
Did that really bother you?,Robin
"Well, yeah. It's nice to be needed. Look, I'm sorry. (",Ted
I got this.,Robin
Yeah.,Ted
nan,Marshall
"Whoa! Baby, you're packing snowballs, and your breath smells like a mermaid fart.",Lily
"Loving the dirty talk-- but you know what's even hotter? If we face this-a-way. Ooh, we're bad.",Marshall
"Wait... hey, baby, why are you facing me north? You're trying to make us have a boy.",Lily
"I... can ex... How do you know about the north thing? Um, um... And what are you doing with those lemons?",Marshall
Baby girl fertilizer!,Marvin
You're trying to make us have a girl! You are trying to make us have a girl.,Marshall
"All my least favorite students have been boys. So I Googled how to make a girl some really weird stuff came up but finally, I found this conception Web site that said you should point south at the moment of conception... eat a lemon......and heat up your lady parts to a balmy 105 degrees. ",Lily
"Lily, how could you do... exactly the same thing I did? You're supposed to be the sane one.",Marshall
See that? Another boy expecting a woman to clean up his mistakes. That's why girls are way better than boys.,Lily
"Oh, really. Well, then how come whenever there's a creepy kid in a horror movie it's always a little girl? Or twin girls, who speak... (",Marshall
"Oh, well, what about Chucky?",Lily
"Okay, A) He was a doll; B) He was possessed by an adult serial k*ll; and C) How could you bring up Chucky right before bed?",Marshall

"No, I didn't feel like you needed me at all.",Barney
"That's what I thought. Uh, I'm sorry.",Robin
"Wait, where are you... That's a compliment. You are the least needy woman I've ever met-- that's awesome. I mean, no guy's gonna say Who's your daddy? to Robin Scherbatsky. You're your own daddy. And mommy. And weird survivalist uncle who lives in a cabin with a g*n blaming stuff on the government. And that is what makes you the most... amazing, strong... independent woman I've ever banged.",Barney
"Thanks, Barney. You know, um... there's something that I wanted to ask you, and I don't really know how to say it so... here goes. Who's the crazy chick in the apron?",Robin

"We looked at each other and, well, we just knew. Our baby's name is... Esther.",Claudia
Esther? That's beautiful.,Marshall
We're idiots.,Lily
"Baby, names and gender, it's just, like... it's some way of giving ourselves the illusion that we have any control whatsoever. I- I just want a healthy, happy, 12-pound--",Marshall
Whoa.,Lily
Ten-pound? Eight-pound?,Marshall
"I guess, but, dude, you're writing checks my vagina can't cash.",Lily

Did it hurt?,Lily
What?,Ted
Getting that kid's nose surgically removed from your ass.,Lily

I did. I sent them downtown. Why are you saying it like that?,Randy
They never arrived at the downtown office.,Marshall
"They... Well, just to make sure we're on the same page is send them downtown not an expression for shredding a document?",Randy
You shredded them?!,Marshall
"Yeah. I sent them downtown. You know, down into the shredder. You-you feed the paper in a downwards fashion, so that's where the expression comes from.",Randy
That's not an expression! That has never been an expression!,Marshall
"Okay, I can fix this. I am all over this project.",Randy
I'll say this: There is no quit in that guy. You should fire him.,Barney

That's the Hermanson contract?,Marshall
"The Hermanson contract? Oh, man, this is the Filbert contract. Damn it! No... ",Randy
I need the Filbert contract!,Marshall
"Well, I'll do what I can. But in my experience, twice shredded is fairly permanent.",Randy
"Sorry, Randy, but... this just isn't working out.",Marshall
"Marshall popped his cherry! Oh! Come on, Marshall, you have to admit, the guy was a disaster. I mean, it reflected badly on the company. He was an embarrassment. A huge embarrassment.",Barney
You slept with Randy!,Lily
What?!,Robin
"Why, it's elementary, my dear Scherbatson.",Lily
"Your co-host is getting super-popular because of her stupid commercial, Boats! Boats! Boats! So, when you arrived at the GNB party after we left, you were feeling vulnerable and drunk. Then, from across the not-so-crowded conference room, your eyes met. And as we all remember... Randy has a unique condition.",Lily
"Yeah, your nose is bleeding like a faucet.",Robin
"Oh, God, this happens every time I get an erection. I am so sorry.",Randy
That's...exactly what happened.,Robin
"See, Marshall, if getting fired is an execution, at least the guy had a last meal. I promise you, tomorrow you'll feel a lot better.",Barney
"Randy, hey, what's going on?",Marshall
I just wanted to say no hard feelings.,Randy
Thank you. So where you headed now?,Marshall
Downtown. ,Randy
No!!,Marshall
"It's okay, baby.",Lily
"Arthur, I'm here because I made a mistake. I fired Randy yesterday.",Marshall
That was a mistake. You should have fired him a year ago.,Arthur
"No, sir, that is what's wrong with this company. How can we say GNB Cares, and then turn around and treat someone like that? I mean, sure, he made a few mistakes but everybody makes mistakes. Like, like Tugboat here. Aw. I bet you he's made some mistakes. And you didn't fire Tugboat, did you?",Marshall
"No, I got him fixed, and he calmed down.",Arthur
Exactly-- kind of. Randy doesn't need to be fired. He needs to be fixed.,Marshall
"Marshall, we do some pretty bad things around here, but I...",Arthur
"No, sir, I'm saying instead of getting rid of someone when they screw up, we should... we should help them. We should nurture them.",Marshall
"I changed the ice pack on his crotch every hour for three days. Wow, Eriksen, if you want to un-fire Randy, I support you, because to come in here and say what you just said, well, you've got a couple things that Tugboat doesn't.",Arthur
"Guys, Prof Rock is a really good mix, okay?",Ted
"A piece of New York history is being torn down, and all you could say was Boo freakin' hoo?",Student
Boo... freakin'...,Ted
I may have mentioned our conversation over a session of hacky sack.,Zoey
"The one day I miss the sack circle, you guys sub her in?",Ted
Why'd you miss? Too busy tearing down the Statue of Liberty?,Zoey
No. I was returning a hot dog costume that you all enjoyed.,Ted
And did it work?,Lily
"Like gangbusters. We're buddies again. After class, we hacked a little sack to the thumpin' strains of my Prof Rock CD. And no, none of them had heard the Pixies B-side. Actually, none of them had heard of the Pixies. Or a B-side.",Ted
"Hey, guys.",Randy
"Uh-oh. I know that smile. Lily, there's no easy way to say this. Marshall's dead. Randy m*rder him.",Barney
No. I know why Randy is smiling. You're smiling because of Robin.,Lily
Robin? Like how I think about her when I'm in the shower?,Randy
"I'm trying to eat here, buddy.",Ted
No. Because you slept with her on Halloween.,Lily
"What? No. I went home, had a shower an-and went to bed.",Randy
You didn't sleep with her?,Lily
"No. Even in the shower, the farthest we ever get is hugging.",Randy
So why are you smiling?,Lily
I'll tell you why.,Randy
This just isn't working out.,Marshall
"Thanks to that severance check, this time next year, you'll all be enjoying a frothy mug of Wharmpiss.",Randy
"Randy, great news! You're not fired!",Marshall
"Good morning, everybody... Where's my class?",Ted
"Hello, Professor. Ha-boom.",Zoey
"I got you your job back, Randy. I thought that you'd be happy.",Marshall
But I don't belong here. I'm born to be a brewer! A... a hopsmeister!,Randy
"Well, then quit. No one's stopping you.",Marshall
I-I can't. I need my severance check.,Randy
"Well, I'm sorry Randy, but that's called fraud.",Marshall
It's not fraud. I'm just asking you to get me a lot of money to not work here and not tell anyone about it.,Randy
"Even if I wanted to fire you, after my talk with Arthur...",Marshall
"Oh, come on, Arthur can't remember that.",Randy
Thanks. It brings out my eyes.,Randy
Yeah. I'll bring out your eyes.,Arthur
"Listen, Randy, I'm sorry, but I broke my own moral code once and I felt evil. I will not let GNB change me. I will never fire anyone again ever.",Marshall
"Oh, we'll see about that.",Randy
"Anyhoo, while I got you-- big smile. We care about making dreams come true, in three, two...",Barney
No!,Randy
What are you doing?,Marshall
"Oh, are you unhappy with my performance? Well, I guess I'm fired, then. I'd better turn in my I.D.",Randy
"No, it's actually, um, nice having some of this clutter off my desk. So thank you, Randy.",Marshall
And there's more.,Randy
"I don't know what I'm going to use this for, but it's great stuff.",Marshall
Now am I fired?,Randy
I've been meaning to clean out that file cabinet for ages.,Marshall
"I'm not even here. Randy, the coffee.",Barney
"Oh! Okay. Okay. Thank you, Randy. I've been meaning to cut back on my caffeine.",Marshall
"Here, try this, but really go for it. Remember, this guy ruined your life.",Barney
That's just the pick-me-up I needed.,Marshall
"Speaking of pickups, can we try the first one again?",Barney
Hello.,Lily
It didn't work. They hate me. How do I get them to like me again?,Ted
"You don't. Ted, you're their teacher. The only people that like their teachers...",Lily
I like my teachers.,Ted
"...are dorks. Except for you, Miles. Ted, you just have to learn to embrace their hatred. Because behind that hatred lies fear. And you can use use that fear, like I did with Johnny Marley.",Lily
Was there more to that story?,Ted
A little bit.,Lily
"Lily, you're a psychopath.",Ted
"A little bit. Oh, a panda!",Lily
"Well, Professor Mosby, is there anything you want to say to us?",Zoey
Anyone not in class tomorrow gets an F.,Ted
You said that?,Lily
"Well, technically, they'd get an incomplete, but I thought F had a nice, scary ring to it. Right?",Ted
Yeah.,Lily
"Hey, guys.",Robin
"Robin, who'd you sleep with?",Lily
I told you-- Randy. He was a machine.,Robin
"Where's the poop, Robin?",Lily
"Fine. I didn't sleep with anyone. The thing is, ever since Becky did that commercial, everyone at work loves her. So, the day after Halloween, I was in a commercial.",Robin
What... Why didn't you tell us?,Ted
"Bladder trouble; it's embarrassing, it's uncomfortable, and it can affect anyone.",Announcer
I'm going to the bathroom right now.,Robin
Neat and discreet adult diapers for anyone.,Announcer
Say... Ah...,Robin
Wow! I can't wait to see it.,Ted
"Well, hopefully you never will. They said that they might not even use it.",Robin
"Okay, you win. Maybe trashing your office was a mistake. It's just, uh, as long as I can remember, making beer has been my dream. Wharmpiss? I know it sounds dumb to someone who's already achieved his dream, big-time lawyer at a huge corporation.",Randy
You think working here is my dream?,Marshall
"Of course. Anyways, I'll clean this stuff up. Have someone get that dead squirrel out of your desk.",Randy
Randy. This is delicious. You're fired.,Marshall
I care about making dreams come true. You got what you need?,Marshall
Yep. That's a wrap.,Barney
Key Ted Mosby's car.,Zoey
She ruined crossword day! I can't believe this. She singles me out by name. Calls me a fat cat. Me and my fat-cat friends. We're not fat cats.,Ted
"Exactly. I say, Marshall, my good man, how's my bow tie?",Barney
"Impeccable, old bean. To industry!",Marshall
"Ah, bully!",Barney
"Look at us, huh? In tuxedos? Can you imagine if our college selves saw us like this?",Marshall
They'd pelt us with their Phish bootlegs.,Ted
"Yeah, we were pretty anti-establishment back then. Oh, God, remember Russell?",Marshall
"Nice monkey suit, Russell.",Marshall
"Come on, guys.",Russel
"Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you with that corporate noose around your neck. And don't even try showing up to the drum circle this weekend.",Marshall
"Oh, hey. You guys seen Russell? I'm supposed to drive him to his mom's funeral.",Ted
I wish I knew you guys back then. You know why? Because you can't kick a story in the nuts.,Robin
"Hey, we're still those people. One of these days, Marshall's going to quit his job and go to work for the NRDC, and save the world, right, baby?",Lily
"Absotively. But let's just remember, I mean, nobody's the same as they were in college. You know, it's like, I wear a suit to work every day.",Marshall
"Well, yeah, but you wear it ironically, like Ted's fanny pack.",Lily
"Next time we go to Great Adventure, you're carrying your own sunblock.",Ted
"Ooh! I love this exhibit. One time when I was a kid, this room was closed for cleaning, so I snuck under the rope.",Lily
Ooh.,Everyone
"Wow, that's pretty cool. When I was a kid, I knocked down the blue whale.",Barney
"Okay, the giant blue whale hanging from the ceiling?",Marshall
"I was six. My uncle Jerry brought me here for the day. He said, Don't touch anything. To a kid. That's like someone telling us Don't look at that girl's perky and impossibly symmetrical knockers.",Barney
Ooh.,Everyone
Not bad.,Robin
"So, naturally, I snapped the rib off a triceratops, blahbity-blahbity-blue, I knocked down the whale. I'm surprised security didn't stop me on the way in.",Barney
"Well, I'm sure they don't remember. I mean, it's been like 30 years since that completely made-up story didn't happen.",Robin
It happened. And these people don't forget. This is not the Natural Stuff That Happened No More Than Five Minutes Ago Museum. Huh?,Barney
"Marshall, Barney, there you are. I want you to meet an old friend of mine from Exeter, George Van Smoot.",Arthur
"But you can, and should, call me The Captain.",George
The Captain?,Marshall
The Captain?,Barney
Back in school we met during a production of ,Arthur
"Well, ahoy.",George
Ahoy.,Barney
"Ahoy, The Captain.",Marshall
The Captain pretty much paid for this entire shindig.,Arthur
"Please, enjoy yourselves, have fun, but don't touch anything.",George
"Thank you, The Captain.",Marshall
Challenge accepted.,Barney
Wow. The future of Goliath National Bank?,Lily
"I know, it's so, uh... You know, I totally forgot to tell you, but, um, the other day, Arthur offered me a five-year contract.",Marshall
"Oh, well, don't turn him down here in public. I broke up with Scooter at the prom. Right before the picture, too.",Lily
"So whatever you do, don't tell him here tonight, 'cause...",Lily
I think I'm going to say yes.,Marshall
"Ah, that's the stuff.",Barney
"I didn't realize you were small potatoes. And to be clear, I am referring to your testicles.",Robin
Impressive. Try this on for size.,Barney
You want to dance? Let's dance.,Robin
I live for the dance.,Barney
Get... your other hand... off my ass.,Robin
"Sorry, sorry.",Barney
"What do you mean, you're going to say yes?",Lily
I-I want to keep working at GNB.,Marshall
But I thought that you...,Lily
"Guys, guys, guys? Architecture fun fact: If you stand right here, and you whisper, a person all the way across the other end of the room hears it like you're standing right next to them. It's one of the most sophisticated pieces of acoustical design in the world. Watch. : Diarrhea. Right? Right?",Ted
But a five-year contract. I thought you hated GNB.,Lily
"Look, I don't hate all of it. Tonight's fun. Take a look around. I mean, this is pretty high-class.",Marshall
"Zoey? Well, well, well.",Ted
You have got to be kidding me.,Zoey
"So, what are we protesting tonight? Rising cost of jet fuel? The government's oppressive top hat and monocle tax?",Ted
"And what are you doing here? Oh, right. Beautiful old building... you're here to knock it down. Can I finish my drink first?",Zoey
"Darling, there you are.",George
"Ted, this is my husband.",Zoey
"Yeah, old stuff's great.",Ted
"Mmm. Ah, this Scotch is good. How's your drink?",Robin
"This is ridiculous. We are two grown adults standing among the greatest collection of natural artifacts in the Western hemisphere, and look at what we're doing.",Barney
You're right.,Robin
Want to go touch a bunch of stuff?,Barney
"Yeah, I do.",Robin
"So, Captain. How'd you get that name, anyway?",Ted
Gave it to myself. A real man chooses his own name.,George
"Well, pleased to meet you, Captain. I'm Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville.",Ted
This is Ted.,Zoey
"Capital. Honey, I may cut out early. I have to go check up on the boat.",George
"The boat? There's a boat? You must tell me about this boat, Captain.",Ted
"Well, she's an 85-foot sloop.",George
She!,Ted
Do you like boats? Does the sea call to you like it calls to me?,George
"Yes. The sea is all like, Ted, come hang out.",Ted
I like Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. You're coming on the boat sometime. Stepping off.,George
"Man, I wish me and my dad were as close as you guys are.",Ted
Oh. You want to make this personal? Okay. Destroy Ted Mosby. Now it's personal.,Zoey
"No, if I wanted to make it personal, I'd call you a bored little trophy wife who likes to play activist when the shops on 5th Avenue are closed.",Ted
You're going down.,Zoey
"Down where? To the yacht club? Oh! I would love to. W-w-wait. I'm half Jewish, will that be a problem?",Ted
So what about becoming an environmental lawyer? What about saving the world?,Lily
"That was a great dream. But we have a mortgage, and we're trying to have kids. We're grown-ups now, Lily.",Marshall
Wieners and gonads.,Ted
What would College You say if he heard what you were saying right now?,Lily
"Honestly? Probably something pretentious, and pseudo-intellectual, like...",Marshall
Boogers.,Ted
"We all change, Lily. You know, you don't spell women with a Y anymore. And I'm okay with that. And you need to be okay with the fact that I may never become an environmental lawyer.",Marshall
So how long have you felt this way?,Lily
Honestly? Since my first day at GNB.,Marshall
Hershey squirts.,Ted
"Hey. How do you like my date's tux? Ooh! Uh, a-thank you! Oh, none for him. He's stuffed.",Robin
"Oh! Zoey! There you are. Oh, my God. You have a monocle. Is this real? Is this really happening?",Ted
Can you excuse us for a moment? Let's go for a walk.,Zoey
Good luck k*ll James Bond. ,Ted
What do you want from me?,Zoey
"I want my crossword day back. Okay? Go live your perfect little life, and leave me the hell alone.",Ted
My life isn't perfect.,Zoey
"Oh, please, what's your biggest problem? Having to sail back to the marina because the Captain's all out of white Zin? Oh. Great. Now you're crying. Like that's going to get my sympathy.",Ted
"You've known about this for two and a half years? So every time you've talked about wanting to be an environmental lawyer since then, that was a lie.",Lily
"Technically, I never lied. You asked me questions, and I responded with made-up words.",Marshall
What?,Lily
"So, you'll probably quit GNB in a couple years, right?",Lily
Affirmatootly.,Marshall
And become an environmental lawyer?,Lily
Yepskerdoodles.,Marshall
"Hey, by the way, do you like this scarf?",Lily
Posititochadochmecochepopocha.,Marshall
Lawyered.,Marshall
"Okay, that's also a made-up word.",Lily
"Okay. Lily, what do you want from me? I want you to be the person I fell in love with.",Marshall
Niled it.,Barney
Thank God you're here. She's been messing with the exhibits.,Barney
I got married when I was 22 to a man who calls himself The Captain.,Zoey
He seems like a good guy. He wears those red pants.,Ted
"I hate boats, Ted. I do, I hate 'em. I can't be on them. I can't be near them. I can't even think about them without getting seasick. You want to know why I want to save that building? Because when I look up at The Arcadian, I see something big and solid, and right now everything else in my life just feels like I'm on a boat. I know it's crazy to care that much about a building.",Zoey
"It's not crazy at all. I'm the same way. Look, Zoey, The Arcadian should be a landmark, it should. The lion head stonework is iconic. I hate that we have to tear it down. I hate working for GNB. They're a bunch of wieners and gonads.",Ted
"Ted, that was... really easy.",Zoey
What?,Ted
This should be useful.,Zoey
You tricked me.,Ted
"Well, it the bug room, Ted. Your ass just got bugged. Oh, the offer still stands. We simply must have you out on the boat sometime.",Zoey
"Well, aren't you two clever. Well, guess what, this museum has seen every kind of prank you can think of. Mummies playing poker, penguins sticking out of volcanoes, dinosaurs from the Cretaceous period hanging out with dinosaurs from the Jurassic period. One time a kid knocked down the blue whale. You name it...",Guard
I'm sorry. Did you say someone knocked down the blue whale?,Robin
"Oh no, not just someone. A six-year-old.",Guard
"Oh, yeah, that story is legend...  Hold on....dary. And, um, would you happen to know what that young man's name was?",Barney
"No. But I could, uh, check the files.",Guard
Thank you.,Barney
"Now, Arthur, your turn. I just sang three songs. Now you-you do your part from ",George
"Take your seats, everyone. The show's about to start. Douche.",Arthur
So I hear my wife got you pretty good.,George
She caught me on tape trashing GNB.,Ted
"Oh, that damn recorder. Try being married to that. But you said you'd get the corgis neutered this weekend. I said no such thing. Oh, yeah? Click. You're a good guy, Galactic President Superstar McAwesomeville. Tell you what, when Zoey goes to sleep, I'll find that tape and erase it for you. No hard feelings.",George
Really? You'd do that to your own wife?,Ted
"Sure. Why not? I mean, I'm glad she has these little causes, they keep her out of troubles, but when she throws a temper tantrum and it gets in the way of someone doing their job, that's a problem.",George
"No, you know what? Don't erase the tape. And for what it's worth, I don't think she's throwing temper tantrums. I just think she's, you know, standing up for what she believes in. I respect that.",Ted
"Hey, what about this? I'll take you out on the boat sometime. You've got to see this boat. She's breathtaking.",George
"July 23, 1981, incident report. At approximately 1000 hours,...vandal dislodged rib from triceratops skeleton...and flung said rib at giant whale. Causing said giant whale to fall in a downward trajectory. And the vandal's name... Well, I'll be damned... Barney Stinson.",Guard
"Who's the master, Leroy?",Barney
"Stinson was reprimanded and returned to the custody of his father, Jerome Whittaker.",Guard
"Uh, no, uncle. Jerome Whittaker is my uncle.",Barney
Uncle Jerry. Says father. Even signed it and checked the box for father and everything.,Guard
Jerry's my uncle.,Barney
I want you.,Lily
"No. I mean, I want you as opposed to who you've become. You've changed so much.",Lily
No.,Lily
"Yes, but I'm okay with that.",Lily
"Actually, you're way better now. You last, like, two, three times as long.",Lily
"It's okay. College Lily thinks those are orgasms. No, it's... it's none of that. It's just this new Marshall... Corporate Marshall... he wears suits all the time. He doesn't care about saving the world. He's not you. I want you back.",Lily
"Actually, Jane's Addiction got back together.",Lily
"Yeah, they've done a few tours, they put out a new album.",Lily
Sure.,Lily
Hey.,Marshall
Hi.,Lily
"Look, Lily, I know that you would have been okay if we were poor and I was trying to save the world, but will you still be okay if I make a lot of money and I spend all of it spoiling you and our kids?",Marshall
We'll make it work.,Lily
So when was the last time you saw him?,Robin
"It was that day... July 23, 1981. My mom got pretty mad that he let me destroy a New York City landmark.",Barney
Moms.,Robin
He never came around anymore after that. Think he moved away.,Barney
"Well, maybe the security guy had it wrong. You never know...",Robin
"But you do know, you do know. That's the thing. You know. He's my dad.",Barney
"Barney, do you want...?",Robin
"I don't want to do anything. Don't tell anyone about this, okay?",Barney
"I'm serious. It's a great look. I think it could come back, but one question. Does it cost half as much as glasses?",Ted
Can I steal you for a second? You don't need to worry. I... What are you doing?,Zoey
"Oh, I thought we were...",Ted
Fine. I erased the tape.,Zoey
What?,Ted
I don't need it. I'm going to b*at you fair and square.,Zoey
Thanks.,Ted
But it's good to know how easily you can be manipulated by a woman.,Zoey
"You look gross when you cry, you know that? Some women look cute. You look like a basset hound.",Ted
"Oh, laugh it up now. Because starting Monday, I got you in my crosshairs.",Zoey
"Bring it on, Princess.",Ted
"Eriksen... It's, uh, 3:00 a.m. You know what, you might as well not even go home.",Arthur
"Oh, God, I have been craving this burger all day.",Robin
Do you know what plays a huge role in helping a woman conceive? Cervical mucus.,Lily
"Oh, my God, I can't wait to see this movie. I hear it's really scary.",Robin
"Oh, change of plans. I thought violent images wouldn't be good for my future fetus, so instead, I rented this video of a live water birth.",Lily
They don't know what it is. It just showed up on my mom's X-ray.,Robin
Look at this crib.,Lily
"Oh, you're wearing a flower.",Marshall
Thank you.,Barney
"Ah, didn't compliment. Just observed.",Marshall
I know. Isn't it?,Barney
Why are you wearing that?,Robin
Why does Barney do anything ever?,Ted
"Exactly. Science. There is an 83% correlation between the times men wear boutonnieres and the times they get laid. Think about it. Proms, weddings. Grandmas' funerals. Thanks for the redhead, Nana. The everyday boutonniere by Stinson.",Barney
"And nope. I'm sorry, Barney, but no girl is going home with a guy with a flower on his chest. Unless he's a clown, and she's in the trunk of his car.",Robin
Along with 50 other clowns. It's a clown car. Oh.,Marshall
"Robin, did you know that boutonniere is French for bootie is near? True story. Une histoire vraie.",Barney
Hmm! Did you know that Barney is French for sad little guy who works way too hard to get laid,Robin
"Woman, you best check yourself.",Barney
"Yeah, on the bright side, I guess suits are pretty boring without them, so...",Robin
Madam... that is an insult that cannot be borne! I demand satisfaction!,Barney
"What, are we gonna duel?",Robin
"No. I'm going to show everyone this embarrassing video of you. It's Robin Sparkles III, y'all!",Barney
I cannot wait to see what's on this DVD!,Barney
"Oh, you haven't watched it yet?",Marshall
"No, of course not. I wanted my first time to be with someone I cared about.",Barney
"Sweet! I get that a lot. Well, once.",Marshall
"Hey, Robin, do you want to go get a Korean massage on Saturday?",Lily
"Oh, I'd love to. I've got this knot in my neck that's so annoying.",Robin
"Yeah, I figured I should get one now because once I get pregnant, no more massages. Just so annoying.",Lily
Space Teens?! Is this a porno?,Barney
"No, no. Dude, dude. Sweet! It's a kids' show.",Robin
"I don't know. This does have all the earmarks of p*rn. Stripper pole, bad lighting, delusional girl who thinks it's a stepping stone to mainstream success.",Ted
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a big old bowl of pornflakes. Whoa! And who is this exquisite keytarist I assum you're about to make sweet love to?",Barney
"Oh, that's Jessica Glitter. She was my BFF on the show and in real life.",Robin
"Ah, BFFs. Did you guys have sleepovers? Get mad at each other and wrestle, but then end up kissing in a tender embrace? Here, show us on Lily.",Barney
"Barney, you know what? If you're going to be disgusting, we're not watching this, okay?",Robin
"Yeah. Come on, Barney. It's just a cute little story about... What exactly is this about?",Lily
"Oh, two average Canadian teenagers who solve crimes in space using math.",Robin
That sounds ridiculous.,Marshall
"Sparkles, Glitter, we're about to enter an asteroid belt, eh.",Robot
"Oh. Oh. I have to say, as much as I hate to agree with Barney, this does seem to be a veritable pornucopia.",Lily
"Okay, guys, come on. It's a kids' show! Like Electric Company or Sesame Street or, um...",Robin
You can't do that on television.,Marshall
Exactly.,Robin
No. You can't do that on television!,Marshall
"Robin, this show is so dirty, I don't know whether to hug you or run a shower for you so you can sit there alone, crying and clenching your knees.",Ted
"It's just bad camera work, okay? Wayne, our camera guy... he wasn't that great.",Robin
"I don't know. I think he did a pretty good job, considering he was probably only using one hand.",Marshall
"You know what? I feel bad for you Americans, that you can look at this wondrous and educational adventure through space, and see something obscene. Can you just please try to look at this with the innocence of a child?",Robin
"Coming up. Here we go. Girls, if you want to get through the asteroid belt, you've got to use multiplication. To the joystick! Okay, Space Teens, let's multiply! Five times six?",Man
Yes! Oh! Seven times four?,Man
Keep going! Eight times nine?,Man
Don't stop now! Almost there! 23 times three?,Man
"I'm sorry. We got to ration this. It's like we're on a desert island, and this video is a really hot, naked chick, and she's got, like, seaweed on her and a seashell bra. You all feel me?",Barney
"Hey, if you and Jessica are BFFs, how come we've never met her?",Lily
"Okay, well, it was a long time ago, okay? I get a Christmas card from her every year, but we're not really friends anymore.",Robin
But BFFs are forever.,Lily
"Oh, come on, Lily. Nobody stays friends with their high school friends.",Marshall
I'm still friends with Punchy.,Ted
"Dude, he lives in Cleveland. You see him once a year, at which point, he punches you really hard in the arm and tells everyone how you dookied your pants. I know, on paper he sounds great, but you guys aren't really friends.",Marshall
"Look, I may not see him a lot, but it doesn't matter. Observe.",Ted
Schmosby!,Punchy
Punchy!,Ted
"Hey, good talking to you, Ted.",Punchy
"Yeah, you, too. If you're ever in New York.",Ted
Definitely.,Punchy
We are just two peas.,Ted
I don't get it. How can you and Glitter just stop being friends? Best friends don't do that.,Lily
"Well, we did, okay? And I haven't talked to her in, like, five years, so just drop it. I got to go.",Robin
Whoa. What do you think came between Robin and Jessica?,Lily
"Much like our friends, the Space Teens, I think I can solve this crime with math. Okay... Okay, here is a Christmas card that Jessica sent Robin. Lily, how old would you say that kid is?",Ted
"Four years, three months.",Lily
Which means Jessica got pregnant five years ago. Right around the time she and Robin stopped being friends.,Ted
Of course. Robin hates kids.,Marshall
The last thing she would want to do is hang out with some little brat.,Barney
"Thus, if I may... When Glitter's womb a fruit did bear, Robin said, To hell with this, I'm outta hare. Glitter got pregnant, so Robin dumped her.",Ted
"That's got to be it, right, Lil? Lil?",Marshall
Robin's gonna dump me!,Lily
"Oh, sweetheart.",Marshall
When a second uterus plumped becomes...,Ted
Dude. Feel the room.,Marshall
No.,Robin
We've been waiting all day!,Ted
Just watch it without me.,Robin
Two dudes on the couch together watching p*rn? That's kind of weird.,Barney
"Okay, it's not p*rn, it's a kids' show.",Robin
Two dudes watching a kids' show might be worse.,Ted
"Okay, fine, I'll watch it with you. Yeah! But if either of you makes even one peep about the show being dirty, I'm turning it off.",Robin
We...,Barney
I'm serious.,Robin
Our characters had pet beavers.,Robin
Sure.,Ted
The beaver is the official animal of Canada. It's our national mascot.,Robin
It's a noble creature.,Barney
"Okay, girls. Everyone knows a beaver's favorite food is wood. I just hope we brought along enough of it for our three-day galactic space journey. So let's do the math. If Robin's beaver devours six inches of wood every half hour, and Jessica's beaver devours eight inches of wood every 45 minutes, how much wood will I need to keep both of these beavers well-fed all weekend long? While you figure it out at home, how about we sing you a song about our beavers?",Man
"Hey! No! You don't get to hear the beaver song! It is a sweet song about friendship, and you guys are being disgusting, and beavers are adorable!",Robin
No arguments here.,Barney
'Sup Shmosby!,Punchy
"Punchy, what are you doing here?",Ted
"Well, yesterday you said if I was ever in New York. 'Sup, turds?",Punchy
"Okay, uh, uh, where are you staying?",Ted
"In your mom's pants. Trick. She's old. Hey, don't worry about me. I'm cool on the couch.",Punchy
Whoa. He's staying here? You're staying here?,Robin
"I know! It's so good, right? Feel like you're dreaming? But check your totem, brah. Punchy's here in the flesh. So, why don't we get one of these, Ted? Yeah. Remember these? High school? Junior high? Yeah. Elementary school? Remember those?",Punchy
"Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied in your pants down by the lake? Unbelievable!",Punchy
"Hey, Schmosby, remember when you dookied on our couch in the form of your idiot high school friend? Unbelievable!",Robin
Come on. I worry about the guy. He's had the same dead-end job at a car rental place for 15 years.,Ted
Don't care.,Robin
He's been stuck in Cleveland his whole life.,Ted
Get a hotel.,Robin
Robin... LeBron.,Ted
"Okay, one night. Got to go.",Robin
Where are you going? We just got here.,Lily
"Oh, a Korean massage.",Robin
By yourself?,Lily
"Well, I figured you'd be busy, reading What to Expect When You're Expecting to Expect.",Robin
"Guys, did you see that? She's going to a Korean massage without me. That's our thing. I'm telling you, she's gonna dump me, just like she dumped Glitter.",Lily
"Lily, come on. We don't even know that's what happened.",Marshall
"Um, hello, somebody already solved that crime using math, remember?",Ted
"Look, Lily. Robin is clearly getting tired of you constantly talking about babies.",Marshall
I don't.,Lily
"Lily, how old am I?",Marshall
384 months.,Lily
Busted!,Punchy
"Okay. So before you Lily all over the place, maybe you should try hanging out with Robin and not talking about babies.",Marshall
"Hey, Lily, what brings you to the crib?",Robin
Crib...,Lily
What's the matter? You look rattled.,Robin
Rattled? I want to talk about babies.,Lily
What?,Robin
"Look, I know you don't care about this stuff, but I'm about to become a mother. And as a future mother, I'm gonna need the support...",Lily
"Oh, my God! You're not even pregnant yet.",Robin
What's that supposed to mean?,Lily
"It means that a fertilized egg has not yet attached itself to the lining of your uterine wall. You see? I read your Facebook updates. God, it's like it's all you ever talk about, Lily, and I'm sick of it!",Robin
"Well, guess what? I've got some good news. When that baby comes, you don't have to see it. In fact, you don't have to see me. This whole friendship thing? Done.",Lily
Great.,Robin
Great.,Lily
For crying out loud. You broke up with Robin?,Marshall
"I had to. We were growing apart, and we're better off without each other.",Lily
"Okay, Lily, you sound about as convincing as you did the time you accidentally shredded my Joey Buttafuoco pants.",Marshall
No!,Lily
"Get on the phone, call Robin and fix this.",Marshall
I can't. The damage is done. Can you just hold me?,Lily
"You know what? No. I don't agree with what you did, and so I refuse to comfort you, despite how adorable you are when you cry.",Marshall
Okay.,Lily
"Okay. Maybe just one cuddle, but then that is it.",Marshall
Times Square's the b*mb! I got so many great pictures of all the billboards.,Punchy
"Yeah. You know, there's more to New York than Times Square. There's the Village, the Lower East Side, Central Park...",Ted
They got better billboards then the ones in Times Square?,Punchy
No.,Ted
Times Square's the b*mb!,Punchy
"Here. You know what? Hold this, okay?",Ted
I'm going to go pee in the jar I got going in the alley.,Punchy
"Seriously, dude, he has got to go. You need to be like, You are the weakest link. Goodbye. Punchy, the tribe has spoken. Please pack up your knives and go. Your work of art didn't work for us. Your time's up. I have to ask you to leave the mansion. You must leave the chateau. Your tour ends here. You've been chopped.",Barney
"Okay, yeah. I know.",Ted
"You've been evicted from the Big Brother house. Your dessert just didn't measure up. Sashay away. Give me your jacket and leave Hell's Kitchen. I'm sorry, you did not get a rose. You have been eliminated from the race. You are no longer in the running to be America's Next Top Model. You're fired. Auf Wiedersehen.",Barney
"Ted, come look at this. I found a little wounded bird in the alley.",Punchy
That's your scrotum.,Ted
"You know what it is, Ted. You know what it is. Come on, Ted. You always fall for that.",Punchy
"Yeah, he's gotta go.",Ted
What are we doing in Madison Square Garden?,Lily
"Okay, you refused to talk to Robin. So I thought that you might like to talk to... the organist for the New York Rangers. Jessica Glitter?!",Marshall
How did you find Glitter?,Lily
"Simple, really. I used my powers of deduction. You see, I knew Glitter used to be a keytarist, which is basically a piano, so I just made a list of all the keyboard-based occupations and then I cross-matched them...",Marshall
"Yo, Glitter... Be cool.",Marshall
More like ex-best friends. Just like you.,Lily
"Yeah, well, Marshall and I are about to get pregnant, and I know she stopped being friends with you when you had a baby, so...",Lily
What? Why?,Lily
Charge!,Marshall
Wow. You dumped her just because you had a baby? That's cold.,Lily
"Oh, God. I gotta go. I gotta go apologize to Robin. I- I need to tell her I love her, and that she'll always be a priority.",Lily
"Hey, do you guys get Big Chuck and Little John out here?",Punchy
"Punchy, it's time to go back.",Ted
Back to Times Square?!,Punchy
"Uh, no. Back-Back to Cleveland.",Ted
"I don't know if I can do that, bro. I mean, yeah, I've been jonesing for a piece of Cleveland-style pizza, but I feel bad about leaving you out here. I worry about you, Ted.",Punchy
You worry about me?,Ted
"Yeah. The other day, when you called...",Punchy
Schmosby!,Punchy
Punchy!,Ted
"Hey, good talking to you, Ted.",Punchy
"Yeah. You, too. If you're ever in New York...",Ted
Definitely.,Punchy
"Sweetie, who was that?",Woman
It was my friend Ted. He sounded kind of depressed.,Punchy
Is this the Ted who got left at the altar?,Woman
"Yeah. He's not doing so good. Poor guy lives in a tiny apartment in New York, nowhere near Times Square. He's got no family around. He's still single, doesn't have a backyard. It's just a bummer.",Punchy
"Maybe you should go visit him. Cheer him up a little. You know, buy him some shots, do the whole wounded bird trick.",Woman
You think that would work?,Punchy
Worked on me.,Woman
"Wow. She sounds pretty great, Punchy.",Ted
"She's my angel. In fact, uh... We're getting married.",Punchy
Wow! Wow! That's... I'm-I'm really happy for you.,Ted
"Thanks, Ted. Thanks. Actually, that's the other reason why I came out here. I wanted to see if you'd be my best man.",Punchy
Of course I will.,Ted
"Yeah! That's great! No, you're stupid. Oh, that's it...",Punchy
"Oh, there you are. Robin, I owe you a huge apology.",Lily
"No, okay? Me first. I've been pulling away from you, and I'm sorry. It's just, the last time my best friend had a baby...",Robin
I know. I know all about it. It's not gonna happen with you and me. And I'm sorry I've been going crazy with this baby stuff. I know you hate babies.,Lily
"Whoa. Look, I hate most babies. But your baby? I'm gonna love that kid so much. I'm gonna pick it up and everything.",Robin
I'm so happy you guys made up.,Marshall
"Me, too.",Ted
Where do I know this song from?,Barney
"Oh, my God. It's the beaver song. Okay, which one of you put this on?",Robin
Wow. This is so dirty.,Barney
"Come on, Barney. It's a sweet song about friendship.",Marshall
"Yeah, dude, come on.",Ted
"*Dah, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah...*",Robin
*You're my favorite beaver...*,Jessica
Two beavers are better than one. *,Robot
"Instead of stuffing, I'm going to fill the turkey with... a slightly smaller turkey. It's called a Turturkeykey!",Ted
A Turturkeykey?,Lily
"Yeah, I was there for the insertion. He used shoehorns. I'll be having sides.",Robin
"Your loss. All right, it's dead in here. I'm gonna call it a little early.",Ted
"What? No! You can't go now. It's the night before Thanksgiving. College chicks are back in town. Their moms just made a snide comment about the weight they gained. They called her a bitch, but deep down, they know she's right. And they're about to walk through that door, where we will be waiting with some light beer and some rock hard approval. Wh-what u-up?",Barney
"Yeah. You don't want to bail early, man. You could become The Blitz.",Marshall
Well... I'm calling it a little early.,Blitz
Wh... you sure? We got big plans.,Ted
"Yeah. Remember how last week we fired up a sandwich, and we listened to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon while watching The Wizard of Oz?",Marshall
"Well, tonight, we're doing the same thing, only with Weird Al Yankovic's Greatest Hits and Apocalypse Now.",Ted
We'll see what happens.,Marshall
"Nah, it's Kraft/Croft night: mac and cheese and Tomb Raider. Biz-zow!",Blitz
Oh! I'm sorry. I thought this was my room.,Woman
Completely naked!,Ted
Completely naked!,Marshall
"Aw, man!",Blitz
And the movie was awesome.,Marshall
"Aw, man!",Blitz
"At the exact moment Brando first appeared, Weird Al launched right into Eat It.",Ted
"Aw, man!",Blitz
"Well, I'm gonna call it. I just got Madden 2K1, and I can't stop thinking about it.",Blitz
Free beer for everyone!,Ted
Free beer for everyone!,Marshall
"Aw, man!",Blitz
"You know what? Ted, go ahead-- leave early to do something lame. Just don't blame us if you become... The Blitz.",Marshall
"All right, first of all... there's nothing lame about brining a Turturkeykey, copyright pending. And secondly, I don't believe The Curse of The Blitz is real. ",Ted
What the hell happened here?,Ted
"Hey! Morning, Blitz!",Robin
"Aw, man! No, no! Let's get one thing straight, okay? I am not The Blitz.",Ted
"Please stop. Okay, fine.",Ted
...To me.,Barney
The Gentleman!,Lily
The Gentleman!,Everyone
Wait! Wait! Wait! What's that? What's The Gentleman?,Ted
"Oh, you had to be there, Blitz. Yes.",Lily
I'm not The Blitz! (,Ted
"Morning, Blitz!",Zoey
"Thanks, guys! Last night was amazing! The Gentleman!",Zoey
The Gentle...,Everyone
"How could you, my best friends in the world, hang out with my mortal enemy, then let her sleep in the tub where I clean myself?!",Ted
"Sorry, Ted. We can explain. After you Blitzed out last night...",Lily
I'm not The Blitz!,Ted
"Oh, my God... That's Zoey! That's Ted's enemy. Which means she's our enemy. Let's take this bitch down.",Lily
Huh? Huh? Who's got your back? Now let's have dinner!,Lily
"Finish the story, Red.",Ted
"Okay, well, we all started brainstorming ways to mess with her. There were a lot of different ideas kicking around.",Lily
"And then I'm just going to leave her there... buck-naked, covered in candle wax, tied to the bed.",Barney
"Barney, I know that Ted doesn't like that girl, but that's a little extreme.",Marshall
Wait... Ted doesn't like that girl?,Barney
"Okay. Wh...? Well, I got it. You see that silk scarf? I'm going to steal it.",Lily
Can I... help you?,Zoey
"Yeah. Yeah! My name is Lily Aldrin. I'm a friend of Ted Mosby's, so you better...",Lily
You're Lily Aldrin? The painter?!,Zoey
"Well, yeah.",Lily
You're amazing! I bought a bunch of your paintings online.,Zoey
nan,Lily
Yeah.,Zoey
Oh! Thanks!,Lily
"Look, none of us meant for it to happen, but, well, we had an awesome night with her.",Robin
The Gentleman! ,Everyone
"And then, the craziest thing happened.",Lily
I missed a skateboarding dog?,Ted
"Yeah, but that wasn't the crazy part.",Lily
It wasn't?,Ted
"Okay, Marshall. Truth or dare?",Zoey
"Okay, awesome. Well, Lily doesn't let me do truths. So, dare.",Marshall
Okay. I dare you to send a picture of your junk to a complete stranger.,Zoey
Best idea ever!,Marshall
"Worst idea ever! My junk ended up in some stranger's pocket. If there phone was on vibrate, I basically dry-humped them.",Marshall
Okay. Everybody shout out random numbers.,Zoey
"4, 8... 15, 16, 23, 42!",Blitz
And... send!,Zoey
"Wait. Blitz was there, too?",Ted
The Gentleman!,Blitz
The Gentleman!,Everyone
"Oh, I was there for the whole thing. Something inside me just said Grand Theft Auto can wait a night.",Blitz
"It was legen-- wait for Ted to leave, 'cause he's now The Blitz-- -- dary. Legendary!",Barney
I'm not The Blitz!,Ted
"I'm afraid you are, Ted. You see, when you left last night, you changed the course of Blitztory.",Marshall
"I'm finally free! I mean, you have no idea what I've missed all these years: The university president's toupee being snatched by a hawk at graduation, Zeppelin reuniting at my cousin Ira's bar mitzvah, countless nip-slips, crotch shots, sh**ting stars and double rainbows. I've missed them all!",Blitz
"Well, not anymore, Blitz.",Barney
"My name's not Blitz. My name is Steve! Colors seem so bright now. Thank you, Blitz.",Blitz
"What? No! N- n-n-n-no! N-n-no! I'm not The Blitz! The only thing I missed last night was my best friends stabbing me in the back by hanging out with my worst enemy. Guys! I hate Zoey! That means you're supposed to hate her, too! Th-that's your rule, Lily!",Ted
I tried.,Lily
"Tried?! Lily, do you have any idea how many people I've blindly hated for you? I hated Ren√©e Zellweger with a burning passion for eight years, only to discover you meant Reese Witherspoon!",Ted
"Hey, I will hate her until I get my money back for You, Me and Dupree!",Lily
That's Kate Hudson!,Ted
"Oh, yeah. That's who I hate. Guys, we hate Kate Hudson.",Lily
"No, we hate Zoey! I'm so furious at you all right now, but it's Thanksgiving, and I have a Turturkeykey to make. And not that I'm The Blitz, but could everyone please come with me into the kitchen? ",Ted
The oven.,Robin
"Hey, Robin, you should dance on the oven.",Barney
Did they tell you about the skateboarding dog? It was awesome!,Steve
"Great. So not only did you guys betray me, but you broke my oven on Thanksgiving?",Ted
"Full disclosure. We also used all your butter, greasing up Lily so we could see how far we could slide her down the hall.",Barney
"But if it helps, I reached 4G.",Lily
It doesn't help. 4G? No. What-What are we supposed to do now?,Ted
This is awesome! I'm part of this!,Steve
"Barney, I don't know if the oven is deep enough. Plus, it's a display made of cardboard.",Ted
Huh. I should probably disconnect the gas.,Barney
"Hey, just so you guys know, there was a tiny expl*si*n at the sewage treatment plant across the street from our apartment, but I'm sure it's fine by now.",Marshall
This is awesome!,Steve
It's not awesome!,Ted
I think the smaller turkey just tried to crawl further inside the bigger turkey.,Robin
Um... Um... I'm have... I'm having trouble breathing!,Barney
"Mom keeps an extra litter box in here. There you go. Good as new. Oh. Hey, Ginger.",Steve
"Ted, you're not gonna like this, but we do have one other option.",Lily
"Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone anyway.",Zoey
Could we bring Ted?,Lily
It's Thanksgiving. What the hell?,Zoey
No. Absolutely not.,Ted
Come on. Give her a chance.,Lily
"Ted, you violated a dead turkey with another dead turkey. Don't let that be in vain.",Robin
Guys? Wait a minute. Where's Barney?,Marshall
"And here's the twist, Babaka. Because Ted left early, he's now The Blitz.",Barney
"But Barney, now you left the group. Wouldn't that put you in danger of becoming The Blitz yourself?",Babaka
No. I c... Because... Step on it.,Barney
You missed it.,Marshall
"Oh, my goodness. Our cab took a wrong turn. We were in the Thanksgiving Day parade!",Steve
Tony Bennett passed Ted the mike and he sang Twist and Shout!,Robin
But he's The Blitz.,Barney
No. I'm not The Blitz. I'm The Bueller. You know what this means. You're The Blitz.,Ted
"Oh, God, no!",Barney
"Life moves pretty fast, Barney. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you might miss it.",Marshall
Chicka-chicka!,Ted
Happy Thanksgiving! Ted.,Zoey
Zoey.,Ted
Best friend alert!,Lily
"Okay, the Turturkeykey is officially cooking.",Ted
"Oh, God, that is disgusting!",Marshall
"Okay, guys, that's starting to hurt.",Ted
"No... no, Ted. Random number guy just sent me his wang back.",Marshall
"Wow. You sent a wang out, and you got a wang back.",Robin
It's a boom-a-wang.,Lily
Nice.,Robin
Thank you.,Lily
"No, I meant the wang.",Robin
"Barney, could you get me some more ice?",Zoey
Sure. But... no one move while I'm gone. : I'm scared.,Barney
You're safe. It's okay to leave the room. You have to actually leave the building for something cool to happen.,Steve
Thanks. You're the only one who's nice to me about this.,Barney
"Okay, I got to test this.",Steve
What happened?,Barney
You missed it!,Lily
"Dude, you walked out of the room, the laws of physics stopped and the laws of awesome tripled.",Marshall
"Aw, man! You said I could leave the room!",Barney
I just wanted to see something cool happen. I'm sorry. But I was on that island for what seems like eternity. I'm going to enjoy things on the other side.,Steve
"No! Y-You... Robin, Robin. I will pay you to be The Blitz. $100! No-- $10,000. No-- 60 bucks. That's a lot of money for someone like you.",Barney
"Dude, The Blitz isn't something that can be bought or sold.",Marshall
"Yeah, it's not like Ted's integrity.",Zoey
"Oh, what was that? I was distracted by the four-caret diamond your 53-year-old husband bought you.",Ted
Facial!,Steve
"Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a turturkeykey to baste.",Ted
I'm coming with you.,Zoey
No... I baste alone.,Ted
"Oh, I'm sure you're a master baster, Ted.",Zoey
Word play. Loving it.,Steve
But relax. I've got a ton of sides to heat up since my plans fell through.,Zoey
Who canceled? Your coven?,Ted
Coven. Group of witches.,Steve
Yeah. They were worn out from putting that spell on your hair.,Zoey
Oh! Serve returned.,Steve
Are you happy? You're ruining Thanksgiving.,Ted
"Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.",Zoey
"God, I'm so happy to be here. My face hurts from smiling.",Steve
"Oh... I'm sorry, Lily. I'm just never going to like that woman.",Ted
"Ted, give her a chance.",Lily
Enemies can't become friends.,Ted
"Yes, they can. Right, guys?",Zoey
"No, no, no. You guys can't be objective. You still feel guilty about last night.",Ted
"Well, let's get an outside opinion.",Robin
Who are we gonna...,Ted
Dear Wang Guy...Can enemies ever be friends? Just wondering.,Robin
Really? Wang Guy? We're asking Wang Guy?,Ted
"He's bold and uninhibited, so why not? And guys, you know what? For fun, why don't we ask him what he does for a living? Wouldn't that be fun? Just ask...",Robin
"Aww. You've got a little crush on Wang Guy, don't you?",Lily
What? No. Shut up. I hate him.,Robin
"Oh, look. We got an answer. Here it is. Yes, enemies can become friends. Remember what Gandhi said. 'Be the change you want to see in the world.'",Marshall
"Uh, did Wang Guy just quote Gandhi?",Steve
"Come on, man. Don't be that Blitz.",Steve
I'm not any Blitz! You're The Blitz! You're all The Blitz! I slept with that cute Indian girl who cuts my hair!,Barney
What does that have to do with anything?,Robin
Nothing! I just forgot to brag about it before!,Barney
"Guys, despite the wit and wisdom of Wang Guy, Zoey and I are never going to be friends. We're just here for her oven and that's it.",Ted
"Oh, my God!",Ted
Did you do that on purpose?,Zoey
What? No. It was an accident.,Ted
"Oh, yeah. Well, like this is.",Zoey
"Oh, great. Real mature.",Ted
"Yeah, well, you started it.",Zoey
"Just stop it! God, can't you two just stop fighting for one day? Like, when the Roadrunner and the Coyote clocked out and had a beer together? Or-Or-Or Tom and Jerry shared a cup of coffee.",Lily
"Lily, those are cartoon characters, and I'm pretty sure you're making up episodes. And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!",Ted
"Oh, get out. All of you, out!",Zoey
But it's Thanksgiving.,Lily
And I'm a part of it.,Steve
Out!,Zoey
Wait... Where's Barney?,Marshall
"Hey, guys, the most amazing thing just happened to me in that other roo... Aw, man.",Barney
I don't get it. Why'd she just kick us out like that?,Lily
Where to?,Driver
I guess we're going home.,Ted
Yeah. I don't know where that is.,Driver
"Lily, where'd you get that?",Ted
"Oh. When Zoey booted us, it made me want to steal something of hers again. Apartment full of designer labels, and what do I grab? Happy Turkey Day, Hannah. Love, Zoey. I wonder who Hannah is.",Lily
"Hey, you guys should come to my house for Thanksgiving. My husband always spends it with his daughter, so I'm going to be alone, anyway. Well, you're not exactly who I thought I'd be spending Thanksgiving with, either.",Zoey
"And if Zoey is a cartoon character, she's Cinderella's evil stepmother!",Ted
"Get out! All of you, out!",Zoey
We have to go back to Zoey's.,Ted
"You gotta throw me some addresses, buddy.",Driver
"Oh, God. What are you doing here?",Zoey
Barney let us in.,Ted
Barney was here? I was walking around half-naked.,Zoey
"Aw, man! Wait. Which half?",Barney
"Look, I'm sorry your stepdaughter didn't want to spend Thanksgiving with you.",Ted
How do you know that?,Zoey
I just do. It must be tough.,Ted
"It was the first Thanksgiving Hannah agreed to spend with me, and then at the last minute she changed her mind. She hates my guts.",Zoey
"I get that. Uh, you should hang on to this. You can give it to her next year.",Ted
Yeah... Right. Next year.,Zoey
"Hey, you never know. People don't stay enemies forever.",Ted
Cheers.,Everyone
"Before we eat, we should take a group picture and send it to Wang Guy.",Zoey
"Ooh. Oh. Great idea. All right. Okay. Here we go. One, two, three.",Marshall
"Ted, that is the best-looking turturkeykey I have ever seen.",Zoey
Thank you. Let's just hope it tastes as good as it looks.,Ted
Oops. We forgot to light the candles.,Steve
The Gentleman!,Everyone
What happened? I saw it!,Barney
"Aw, come on, Blitz. Now it's just sad. Aw, man. Oh, go ahead. I forgot my jacket.",Steve
"Oh, hold the door!",Woman
"Thank you, God!",Barney
"Boys! Great to see you! Looking smart. Have a wonderful time tonight, okay?",Captain
Okay. That man is terrifying.,Marshall
"Everything he said was nice, but I am profoundly scared.",Barney
Keep smiling. He can still see us.,Ted
I figured it out! I know what's so creepy about The Captain.,Marshall
Okay.,Robin
Yeah. I snapped this photo of him last time he dropped off Zoey.Observe. The bottom half of his face... is smiling. He seems happy. Seems like a nice guy. ,Marshall
"Captain, what do you think of rainy days?",Barney
"Whoa, he hates them.",Marshall
"Captain, quick question: How do you feel about the Jonas Brothers? Ooh.",Robin
Ooh. What-What is that?,Ted
He hates that he loves them.,Marshall
"Great. Okay. Hey, guys, Zoey just told me about this great Frank Lloyd Wright retrospective tonight. Who's in?",Ted
"Sorry, I'm, uh, I... I- I don't know, washing my hair.",Lily
Running the water.,Marshall
Holding the towel.,Robin
And I'll be home trying to get over the fact that no one invited meto the big hair washing party.,Barney
"All right, fine. Guess it'll just be me and Zoey.",Ted
"Oh, wait. Just the two of you? Tread lightly, Mosby. Any time a single guy hangs out with a married woman, there are rules that must be followed. Rule number one...",Lily
Don't use the husband's condoms. That's just rude.,Barney
Rule number one: don't go anywhere that has candles.,Lily
"Excuse me, Captain, how do you feel about Ted and Zoey having an intimate chat by candlelight? It'll be the last dinner they ever have.",Marshall
"Rule number two: No sharing food. In fact, anything involving saliva is off-limits. Toothbrushes, thermometers, lipstick.",Lily
"Well, if I can't share her lipstick,there's really no pointin even going.",Ted
And the most important rule of all...,Lily
Lubricant is public property. ,Barney
Please.,Marshall
No lying to the spouse about anything you do.,Lily
"Why would anyone lie? Look, Zoey and I are just friends. If there was anything more than that, I wouldn't hang out with her.",Ted
"Lily's right, Ted. Once you're married, it's very hard to be friends with a single person of the opposite sex.",Marshall
"Yeah. Unless you're old friends, which is why I can hang out with Marshall whenever I want. Right, Marsh Madness?",Robin
"No doubt, Robo Cop.",Marshall
You two never hang out alone. You just made up those nicknames right now.,Lily
I guess it's true. You and I never really hang out alone.,Marshall
"Well, let's. Let's have dinner together, just the two of us.",Robin
Oh! Sweet. No candles.,Lily
"Lily, I guess that leaves just you and me. Want to hang?",Barney
Nah.,Lily
You're a big... stupid octopus head!,Lily
"Well, Lily, you were right. Something weird happened with Zoey last night.",Ted
"Oh, that's the Captain. Yes, I call my husband The Captain, but that is the only concession I make to his seafaring ways. Hang on. Ahoy. I'm just out with friends.",Zoey
Friends. Plural. Like-Like there was more than one of me.,Ted
"Ew! Ew! She lied to her husband? Uh-oh. So, what did you do?",Lily
"Uh, Zoey, um, did you just say you were out with friends?",Ted
"Yeah. The Captain's on his way home from Milan. He can get a little jealous sometimes, so I didn't want to make him worry. Is that okay?",Zoey
It's totally okay.,Ted
"It's not okay! I didn't really think it was okay! Pur-leez! You lie to your husband all the time. Uh, uh, that shirt looks great on youI love your momI never fantasize about Barney when we're doing it Sound familiar, Pinocchio?",Lily
What's wrong with this shirt?,Marshall
"Lily, ruling. Do I have to stop hanging out with Zoey?",Ted
"No, you just need to spend time with her and The Captain together. If you're friends with the both of them, then there's not a problem.",Lily
"Actually, I do have a standing invitation from The Captain to go for a ride with them on his boat.",Ted
"Great. So go make nice with Captain Creepy, and problem solved.",Lily
December chill... so great.,Robin
Totally.,Marshall
Did you catch the game last night?,Marshall
Yeah. Nail-biter.,Robin
You know what's fun? Is cold weather sports.,Marshall
They are fun.,Robin
"Man, this is awkward.",Robin
"She's giving me nothing! He's just staring at me! She's just staring at me! It's making me nervous. Great, now my left eye is twitching.",Marshall
"Marshall, it's cool. She doesn't see it. What the hell's going on with his eye? Am I supposed to not talk about that? Great, now my right eye is doing it.",Robin
Can I get you two some drinks?,Waiter
Lots of drinks.,Marshall
"Oh, so many drinks.",Robin
Barney.,Lily
"Save it, Lily. I am still mad at you for... something, and for that other thing.",Barney
"Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But let's be honest. You've been super sensitive lately.",Lily
Watch out!,Lily
Watch out!,Lily
"Oh! Wow. Thanks, Lily. You saved me. You saved us. Look, I know you didn't mean whatever it was you said that made me so mad.",Barney
I think I probably didn't.,Lily
Wait. I still can't resist getting one last sh*t in.,Lily
"Hi, Captain. The Captain. Captain.",Ted
"Ahoy, Ted! Excellent to see you.",Captain
"Ah, you, too. Uh, where's Zoey?",Ted
"Well, I'm afraid she's feeling a little under the weather. Looks like it's just you, me and six hours in frigid international waters.",Captain
"Or we could stay on dry land, hang out with some... witnesses.",Ted
"You're a hoot. I've been looking forward to this. For a very long time. Well, anchors aweigh!",Captain
"You know, I had this really boring poetry class in college.",Robin
You were just thinking that this dinner is really boring. That's what made you think of your boring class in college.,Marshall
"What?! What? No! No! No, no, no. Marshall, no. No. I... I just saw that board of specials, and I thought, you know what sucks? Being bored. Which I am not. So that clears that... right up.",Robin
"Robin, I'm an attorney.",Marshall
Fine. This night's a little awkward.,Robin
I guess it's 'cause we never hang out alone together.,Marshall
Why is that?,Robin
It's 'cause of The Mermaid Theory.,Marshall
"Two years ago, I had just hired a new assistant at GNB.",Marshall
"So, who's the eye broccoli?",Barney
"Okay, that's Iris, my new assistant. And yes, she's a little plain, but I'm married, so that's good.",Marshall
"Mark my words, Marshall. Someday you will find Iris so excruciatingly attractive, you won't be able to look her directly in the boobs.",Barney
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.,Marshall
"Marshall, do you know how the myth of mermaids came to be?",Barney
I'm sorry. Myth?,Marshall
"It was 300 years ago. Sailors stuck at sea would get desperate for female companionship. It got so bad that, eventually, the manatees out in the water started to look like... beautiful women. Mermaids. Let's go get some tail! Oh. You see, every woman, no matter how initially repugnant, has a mermaid clock... the time it takes for you to realize you want to bone her. Sure, today you see Iris as a manatee. But she ain't gonna stay that way. Marshall, your secretary's mermaid clock starts right now.",Barney
"And it took one year, three months, and 16 days, but eventually...",Marshall
D'oh! Told you. The Mermaid Theory. It's a thing. You owe me 500 bucks.,Barney
Did we bet on this?,Marshall
Let's say yes.,Barney
And that's why we never hang out alone? Yes.,Robin
"As Lily's best friend, you are the last person on the planet o's allowed to turn into a mermaid.",Marshall
"Wait, does that mean that I'm a manatee right now?",Robin
Big-time manatee.,Marshall
What were those sailors thinking?,Robin
Huh. I don't know. Being out at sea can do crazy things to a man.,Marshall
"Vast, the sea. Deep. Endless. Going around for miles. You could scream and scream, and not a soul would hear you. Listen to this.  Help! Somebody help me! I'm trapped on a boat with a madman! Help! See? Nothing.",Captain
"He's gonna k*ll me. Okay, calm down, Teddy. He's not jealous. He hasn't even mentioned Zoey.",Ted
"So, Ted, I noticed you've been spending a lot of time with Zoey.",Captain
"Seriously? I step away for five seconds, and you eat all my onion rings? No surprise there.",Lily
"What's that supposed to mean? Are you calling me fat? If there is one thing you never do, it is call a woman fat right to her face!",Barney
Want to hang?,Lily
Nah. Watch out!,Barney
"Wow... thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us.",Lily
"If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face!",Lily
"Oh, Lily, I'm sorry. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",Barney
You're a jerk.,Lily
"Ted, let me show you my harpoon collection.",Captain
"Just gonna make a quick call. Hey, silly question. What are our exact nautical coordinates?",Ted
"How now? Oh, bother.  Well... she's a goner. By now, the icy tide has already dropped its core temperature to near freezing. And down it goes. Now it's at 50 meters. Complete crushing blackness. 100 meters. The pressure is so intense, the keys are popping right out of its head.",Captain
Head?,Ted
"200 meters. No one will ever find its mangled remains, save for the crustacea that feed off its lifeless husk. Can you hear me now? No. Because you're on the bottom of the sea.",Captain
"Well, I got a big morning, so... Dry cleaners, bank, you know, so...",Ted
"Ted, it's time. I have something for you. Wait here.",Captain
": Okay, you got to swim for it, Mosby. Man versus sea. You can do this. You didn't get a Good Effort ribbon from the Shaker Heights JCC Swim Camp because you don't have what it takes.",Ted
Found it. Zoey told me you're a scotch drinker. I bought this special for tonight.,Captain
Ted?,Captain
"you're afraid that if you spend too much time alone with me, I'll turn into a mermaid?",Robin
"Yes. I mean, sure, right now, you're bald and leathery ancovered in a thick layer of blubber...",Marshall
Am I blushing or...?,Robin
"...but at some point, my stupid male brain will transform you into a foxy fish-babe singin' Part of Your World to my pants.",Marshall
"Okay, even if that happens, is there any way to un-mermaid me?",Robin
I asked Barney the same thing.,Marshall
"Once mermaid-ified, there's only one way a woman can go back to being unattractive again, but it's pretty gruesome.",Barney
Death?,Marshall
"Worse. Pregnancy. If a baby's on board that train, it is headed straight back to Manatee City... where the grass ain't green and the girls ain't pretty.",Barney
Pregnancy?,Robin
"Mm-hmm. Once a mermaid gets pregnant, she becomes a manatee again. Never thought I'd say that sentence.",Marshall
"Well, Lily, I guess it's just you and me. You wanna hang?",Barney
"Nah. Whenever we're alone, you spend the whole time undressing me with your eyes. You even take off my shoes.",Liy
"High heels chafe my shoulders. But you don't have to worry about that anymore. Ever since you got pregnant, you're just a big fat manatee.",Barney
"Well, you're a big... stupid octopus face!",Lily
"Wow. Thanks, Barney. You saved me. You saved us. If there's one thing you never do, it's call a woman fat right to her face!",Lily
"I'm sorry, Lily. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",Barney
Oh... You're a jerk.,Lily
"Hey. Hey, wait. Come on. I was kid... Wait, wait, wait! There's another addendum to The Mermaid Theory. A pregnant woman who's become a manatee can become a mermaid again through one simple act.",Barney
What's that?,Lily
Breast-feeding. Hot.,Barney
Really?,Lily
Really. When those things swell up to three times their normal size... so do I.,Barney
That's so sweet!,Lily
"Okay, now we're even!",Ted
So you really thought I was gonna k*ll you?,Captain
Well... ish.,Ted
"Oh, Ted, that's ridiculous. If I wanted to k*ll you, I'd invite you to my hunting lodge. It's far more remote, and I wouldn't have to worry about you turning up in some nosy fisherman's net.",Captain
See? It's stuff like that. Why-why do you talk that way?,Ted
"Oh, I'm just jesting for sport. See, sometimes I don't bond as well with Zoey's younger friends. But I know she really likes you. I was hoping that maybe we could be buddies.",Captain
We can. We can be buddies. Just not on a boat.,Ted
Fair enough. The hunting lodge it is.,Captain
"Yeah, me, too.",Marshall
"No... No, no! No! No, don't turn!",Marshall
"Uh-oh. I don't feel so good.  Oh, my God! Oh, my God, I am, I am so sorry! Oh! You must think I'm totally disgusting.",Robin
I really do.,Marshall
"Hey, Ted.",Zoey
Hey. You feeling better?,Ted
I have a confession to make. I wasn't really sick.,Zoey
You weren't?,Ted
"I'm sorry. I was just feeling guilty that I lied to The Captain and... I don't know, I just thought it would be good if you two spent some time together.",Zoey
"I get it. And you were right. He's a nice guy. I mean, he can be a little scary.",Ted
"Yeah, he gets a little m*rder when he's nervous.",Zoey
"Yeah, he's a creepy dude. But I like him. And I just want to make sure you and I hanging out doesn't, you know, cross any lines.",Ted
"Me, too.",Zoey
"I mean, if either one of us had even the slightest hint of feelings for the other, we shouldn't hang out. You don't, do you?",Ted
No. Do you?,Zoey
No.,Ted
This is taking forever. Are you sure you did it right?,Marshall
Is there a wrong way to pee on a stick?,Lily
"Hey, can I ask you a question that's plagued me for years? Can girls aim?",Marshall
"Um, can boys aim? 'Cause it seems to me like I'm taking a mop to that bathroom floor every two days.",Lily
"Okay, you're the one who put the ",Marshall
It's been two minutes.,Lily
It's positive.,Lily
It's positive? It's positive.,Marshall
I'm pregnant.,Lily
What?!,Robin
I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry. Force of habit. Congratulations!,Barney
To Lily and Marshall.,Robin
"Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier. Can't imagine anything bringing me down right now.",Marshall
You're not pregnant.,Doctor
"Well, that did it.",Marshall
Are you sure you did it right?,Marshall
"Hey, Punchy, I've given this some serious thought. I think I know how we can crush these floral arrangements.",Ted
"Ah, here it comes. Hit me up, Schmos!",Punchy
"Peonies, lavender blossoms with a halo of baby's breath for an ambiance of springtime rejuvenation.",Ted
That's exactly the accent of whimsy this celebration of love needs!,Punchy
It's gonna be a magical day. (,Ted
I do wish you were a dude.,Robin
"Because if I was a dude, I could have Ted Mosby as my best man.",Ted
"No, and here's why.,Ted, the best man's job is not to crush the floral arrangements. It's to get the groom down the aisle, because, no matter who he is, he will freak out. And I just don't think you have what it takes to get that get that soldier to pick up his r*fle and charge up the hill.",Robin
"Uh, are you forgetting I've done this before? I was Marshall's best man.",Ted
And how did that go again? Oh for one.,Robin
"Oh, come on. That wasn't my fault. And need I remind you, I gave a beautiful toast.",Ted
"Ted.  Oh, do you take one to be your lawfully wedded wife? Oh, God, I'm freaking out. Why did I chose Ted to be my best man?",Robin
"Uh, yeah. It's hard to take criticism from someone who just recorded seven episodes of ",Ted
"All right, your practice flip came up tails... But our Vegas oddsmaker tells us that the next toss is still just 50-50. And so, Jordan, for one million dollars......Heads... or tails? ",Animator
What was the year of the coin again?,Jordan
Why this sudden obsession with ,Ted
"Well, it turns out that ",Robin
Ta... heads.,Jordin
"Marni, flip that coin.",Animator
"So now, because of that incident, ",Robin
You mean coin flip bimbo?,Ted
They're not bimbos!,Robin
"You auditioned, didn't you?",Ted
You're the new coin flip bimbo?,Ted
Currency rotation specialist.,Robin
"Robin, you better check yourself before you trebek yourself. You're a journalist! What is the matter with you?",Ted
"Well, it's a national audience! I get to wear shiny dresses!",Robin
"Robin, have you forgotten about your New Year's resolution?",Ted
I am never drinking again.,Robin
"No, before that.",Ted
"Before that, too.",Ted
"I moved here to work for a big-time cable news channel like World Wide News. Mm-hmm. Well, by this time next year, I will be wearing a World Wide News I.D. badge around my neck. And to show you that I'm serious, this is my first and only drink of the night. Okay. Okay? Oh, damn, that's smooth.",Robin
I thought you finally got that interview at World Wide News.,Ted
"Well, I did, but they only offered me a boring, low-paid, off-camera research job.",Robin
Which could be a stepping stone to bigger things in your career.,Ted
"Well, so could ",Robin
I'm pregnant.,Lily
What?!,Robin
"Oh, my God! They're really having a baby. What am I doing with my life? Starting Monday, I'm a currency rotation spe... Oh, who am I kidding? I'm a coin flip bimbo, and I'm still single. Okay, let's not go there, Scherbatsky. That's a whole other thing. I've got to take that World Wide News job.",Robin
"Well, you are looking at the new associate researcher at World Wide News.",Robin
"Oh, my gosh. That's amazing news.",Marshall
What changed your mind?,Ted
"Marshall and Lily. I just realized that I am about to have a little niece who looks up to me. And I don't want to be sad aunt Robin, the aging coin flip bimbo who gives her the creeps. I want to be cool aunt Robin, the respected journalist... (",Robin
What?,Lily
What? Oh. I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall.,Robin
"Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier.",Marshall
"Hi, Mr. Trebek. This is Robin Scherbatsky.",Robin
You're not pregnant.,Doctor
"As honored as I am by the offer, um... (",Robin
You are looking at the new coin flip bimbo.,Robin
You took the ,Ted
Yeah.,Robin
"What about World Wide News, your I.D. badge? You made a New Year's resolution.",Ted
"Okay, I also said I would never make out with a garbage man. Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. What's with the gingerbread house?",Robin
We're seeing a Christmas movie. It's a Christmas-themed movie snack.,Ted
"Let's hope Santa brings you a girlfriend this year, Teddy.",Robin
Where the hell is Barney?,Ted
And now she's totally winning ,Robin
"Hey, guys. A yuletide riddle. What is my second favorite word that begins with b-o-n?",Barney
Bon Jovi?,Ted
Yeah. What is my third favorite word that begins with b-o-n? ,Barney
"My God, Barney! I work for GNB, too. All I got was $15 gift card to Costa Coffee.",Ted
"And you earned it, buddy. Check out what I'm gonna buy for myself. The dibiase. See those pinstripes? Diamonds. It is the uppest a person could ever suit.",Barney
"Uh, has it ever occurred to you to give some of this to charity?",Ted
"Charity? You're seriously talking to me about charity? Dude, I am Mr. Charity. I frequently sleep with sixes, chubsters, over-thirties... I am the bill and Melinda gates of the sympathy bang.",Barney
"Hey, guys. Big announcement.",Marshall
"Let me guess. You got a huge bonus check, too.",Ted
"No, just a $30 gift card to Costa Coffee.",Marshall
Thirty?!,Ted
I'm pregnant.,Lily
What?!,Robin
"What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!",Barney
Huh. Marshall and Lily are doing something meaningful. And it's making me less happy about this bonus. And I'm still single. At least I got that going for me. So why do I still feel outside of awesome looking in? What am I doing with my life?,Barney
we've never been happier. can't imagine bringing e down right now.,Marshall
"Oh, Marshall, you only think you're happy. Just wait, because tonight, (",Barney
Huh? I don't know what that is.,Marshall
"Barney's Favorite Things! I'm gonna give you all a bunch of free stuff... like Oprah. Just get excited, okay?",Barney
Velour track suits!,Barney
Velour is so comfortable. They're so soft.,Marshall
Remote control helicopters! Condoms! And last but not least... There is a fleet of limos outside waiting to take us to... A strip club! (,Barney
No. No! I cannot go back to that strip club. I seen some things.,Ted
I'm not going back either. I'm taking the rest of my bonus to God's strip club.,Barney
"Sam. Uh, father. I-I don't mean father father. Unless...",Barney
"What's up, Barney?",Sam
I'm thinking about giving some money to charity.,Barney
"Is that the name of the stripper you've been e-mailing me about? You got to take me off that list, Barney.",Sam
"No, I don't mean that charity. That charity is doing peachy. You'll see pics of the two of them in next week's e-mail.",Barney
"What up! Barney, I'm a minister. Unsubscribe.",Sam
"I-I recently started giving, and it felt surprisingly good. I want to do more.",Barney
"Well, now you're talking. We have this program that helps those in need get back on their feet. We give them food, a place to live, clothes for job interviews.",Sam
"Well, I would love to help by writing a check for... one, zero, zero, zero...",Barney
You're not pregnant.,Doctor
...Zero... (,Barney
"That's great. Thank you, Barney!",Sam
"Diamond suited up. Hey, Ted, can you spot me for the movie? I don't like to carry a lot of cash on me.",Barney
What happened to giving the money away?,Ted
"Yeah, that was back when Lily was pregnant. Now she's not. Ergo, a suit is born. (",Barney
It's a Christmas-themed movie snack!,Ted
"Ah, I know that move. You cut a hole in the floor, she reaches into the living room, finds the tree... Nice.",Barney
Where the hell are Marshall and Lily?,Ted
I'm pregnant.,Lily
What?!,Robin
"What?! I've never seen that woman before in my life! Sorry, force of habit. Congratulations!",Barney
"This is great. I'm happy. I'm so happy, my heart's pounding. And I'm sweating. And I can't breathe. This is what happiness feels like, right? Oh, crap. Lily's having a baby and I'm having a panic attack. I hope she can't tell what I'm thinking right now.",Marshall
"I can. And I'm freaking out, too! There's an alien growing in my stomach that's gonna explode out of my vagina!",Lily
Do you think the others can tell we're freaking out?,Marshall
What am I doing with my life?,Robin
What am I doing with my life?,Barney
I should get a Christmas-themed movie snack for tomorrow night.,Ted
They're totally onto us. What do we do?,Marshall
"Just keep smiling, maybe wave. No, don't wave! That makes no sense!",Lily
I'm committed. I'm riding this wave straight to hell.,Marshall
"Let's leave, then the waving will make sense.",Lily
"Lily, we have to relax. There's no need to panic. True, there's a lot to do, but we've got nine months to prepare. So I say that we just make a list of everything that needs to get done before the baby arrives and do everything on that list tonight!",Marshall
"Let's do it! Uh-huh, got it. Okay, that seems easy.",Lily
Nursery's painted!,Marshall
Blue? What if it's a girl?,Lily
Damn it!,Marshall
"Oh, God, it's 8:00! We're supposed to meet the gang at the bar to celebrate.",Lily
"Oh, God. Okay, listen. When we meet them, we have to keep it together. Can you keep it together?!",Marshall
"No, I can't keep it together!",Lily
I have never seen you guys looking so at peace. To Lily and Marshall.,Robin
"Well, thank you. I mean, we've never been happier.",Marshall
This is a nightmare! We've done everything wrong!,Marshall
The iPod was on shuffle! ,Lily
"You know what, the Jerky Boys are funny.",Marshall
"The Jerky Boys aren't funny, they are awful.",Lily
"You know what, fine, if you don't think the Jerky Boys are funny, then I'm not sure that I can raise a child with you, liver lips.",Marshall
"Marshall, I don't like this.",Lily
"I know. Okay? I don't like it either. It's like I have a hot, burning ball of stress in my chest, and nothing will make it go away!",Marshall
You're not pregnant.,Doctor
"Well, that did it.",Marshall
I know this probably comes as quite a disappointment.,Doctor
Yeah. Huge bummer.,Marshall
So disappointing.,Lily
Are you guys okay?,Ted
"Huh? Yeah. Why wouldn't we be? Oh, the baby thing.",Lily
"Oh, yeah, whatever. Oh, Christmas-themed movie snack. Nice.",Marshall
Don't reach into the living room!,Lily
"Wow, I-I thought you guys would be devastated.",Ted
"Oh. You know, we're actually kind of relieved. We were freaking out for about a day and a half there.",Marshall
"Yeah, this whole thing got us thinking. Maybe we're not ready for kids yet after all.",Lily
"Yeah, we were thinking maybe we would just get a dog.",Marshall
Get a puppy!,Barney
Can you imagine... That would be the cutest thing!,Marshall
Oh. Our movie snack.,Barney
"Are you kidding me?! All you ever talk about is having kids! And now you have one little freak-out and you want to get a dog instead?! No. Unacceptable! You're gonna turn around, you're gonna go home, get naked, lie together as man and wife until Lily is great with child. Right now! I'm serious! Go, go, go!",Ted
"And you! Ooh. Barney, you look real stupid in that suit. You're gonna go get your money back and give it to charity. And I don't mean that stripper you keep e-mailing us about, even though we beg you to take us off that list.",Ted
"I can't give this suit back. Ted, I glow in the dark. I finally glow in the dark!",Barney
Criminals of New York! Attention! This man is wearing a diamond-covered suit! You could retire on the pants alone! Merry Christmas!,Ted
"And you... You did not move to the greatest city on earth to become a coin-flipping bimbo. So here's how it's gonna work: Heads, you take the job at World Wide News; Tails, you take the job at World Wide News. Ow! Hey, looks like somebody got a new gig!",Ted
"Fine, I'll call them tomorrow. I'll call them right now.",Robin
Hello.,Ted
"Ted, I can't get married!",Punchy
"Yes, you can! You love her!",Ted
"You're right, I do! Thanks, Ted!",Punchy
One for ,Ted
We're idiots.,Marshall
This kid doesn't stand a chance.,Lily
We're ready for this.,Marshall
We're ready for this.,Lily
Wow. That's a lot of zeroes. Y-you sure you're not missing a decimal point?,Sam
Nope.,Barney
"And that's the tour. Uh, staff meeting's at noon, you'll meet everyone there, but first you need to head down to security. You need to get your picture taken. For your I.D. badge.",Woman
You sure?,Marshall
Positive.,Lily
And there's more. Do you still do that thing where you give people in need clothes for job interviews?,Barney
Yeah. Why?,Sam
"Bring 'em in, boys! Merry Christmas.",Barney
"Thank you, son.",Sam
Son?!,Barney
It's just an expression. I'm still not your dad.,Sam
Congratulations.,Ted
"You know, that was really cool what you did. When we all needed it, you got us back on the right path.",Robin
It's what I do.,Ted
"Hey, Ted, if I, um, if I ever get married and you're not the guy I'm marrying...",Robin
"Big mistake, but go on.",Ted
"...I could really use someone like you. You know, in case I freak out. When I freak out. You interested?",Robin
Are you asking what I think you're asking?,Ted
"Ted, will you be my best man?",Robin
Scherbatsky... I'm gonna crush it.,Ted
"Hi, there. We've had a lot of fun tonight, but on a more serious note, this is the time of year when we remember the importance of giving. And there's no greater gift than the gift of booty. So, this holiday season, why not bang someone in need? I'm Barney Stinson, and that's... One to grow on.",Barney
"Um, no.",Woman
"Hi, there. You know, we've had a lot of fun tonight...",Barney
"We've been trying and trying, and still nothing's happened. I'm just worried we can't have children.",Lily
And how long have you been trying?,Doctor
Six days.,Lily
Something must be wrong. W... we're doing it a lot.,Lily
"And everywhere... the kitchen, the bathroom, the living room, outside in your wait... the kitchen.",Marshall
"Seriously, Doc, why isn't this happening?",Lily
"Look, if you're really worried, here is a number for a reproductive endocrinologist... Dr. Stangel. He's the best in the city.",Doctor
"Dr. John Stangel? I don't know, baby, do we really need a specialist?",Marshall
"Well, what's your plan, Marshall, just have unprotected sex day after day after day in every position imaginable until...? Wait, it sounded worse in my head.",Lily
"Guys, we've got a problem. This is the application for the regional doubles laser tag tournament in Poughkeepsie. Problem is, only one of you can be my partner. So it looks like we've got a bake-off. You may now present your arguments.",Barney
I'm not playing laser tag.,Marshall
I'm absolutely not playing laser tag.,Ted
Damn it.,Marshall
And Marshall's the winner.,Barney
"Well, I'm gonna call Dr. Stangel. It can't hurt.",Lily
So I understand you want to get pregnant.,Stangel
"Yeah, and it cuts in and out.",Barney
Ooh! How did you do it?,Lily
"Oh, God, you found one of the cameras. I swear that's the only one. Wait, which one did you find?",Barney
What are you talking about?,Lily
What are you talking about?,Barney
My visit to a certain Dr. Stangel.,Lily
"We'll look at all the factors that contribute to fertility: dietary, environmental, genetic. But first, Ms. Aldrin, do you have any questions for me?",Strangel
"Just one, Dr. Stangel. Where'd you get the beard?",Lily
"Well, m... my mother's Armenian.",Strangel
"Lily, I've been with Barney since 9:00 a.m. Between the sexual harassment seminar all morning and the secretary beauty pageant all afternoon, he hasn't left my sight.",Marshall
"Wait, so you weren't wearing a fake beard and examining girl parts all day?",Lily
Not today I wasn't.,Barney
"Wow, we finally found Barney's doppelganger. I guess we can tell you now, Lily. That hot dog guy did not look like Barney.",Ted
"Uh, Marshall?",Lily
"Yes, I know, we made our little deal with the universe, but...",Marshall
"No, we've made a binding covenant with the universe. We said we weren't going to try to have kids until we saw Barney's doppelganger. Oh, this is bad news. This is like a black cat walked through my uterus. Okay, that's it. I am going back to Dr. Stangel and getting thoroughly checked out.",Lily
Or... or cost-saving alternative: you could get checked out by someone who looks just like him. I'm gonna go scrub up. I'll meet you in stall three.,Barney
I still kind of think it's Barney.,Lily
There's no way it's Barney.,Marshall
"Hello, you must be Mr. Eriksen. I am Dr. Stangel.",Stangel
"It's Barney. Wow. Really, dude, bravo. You almost got a peek. But seriously, what second-rate community theater did you get...?",Marshall
Would you...? I...,Stangel
So my wife and I are trying to get pregnant.,Marshall
"All right, Ms. Aldrin, please just put your feet up in the stirrups. We can begin.",Stangel
"Uh-uh, no. Can't do it.",Lily
"No, but, baby, I yanked on his beard.",Marshall
He checks out. I really don't have time for this.,Stangel
"No, Barney... Doctor, wait, please, it's... Can you just give us a couple minutes? I... Lily, how can I convince you that this is not Barney?",Marshall
"Wow, it is like looking into a poorly dressed mirror.",Barney
"Okay, you have to go. Leave the model of the vagina.",Stangel
Okay. Convinced.,Lily
"Great. All right, you're a little low on the table. Please scoot up.",Stangel
Suit up... not convinced. This whole thing stinks to high heaven.,Lily
"Baby, you just saw Barney.",Marshall
He could have pulled some crazy switch. Remember when his Swedish cousin came to visit?,Lily
"Oh, yeah... Bjorney.",Marshall
"Yeah, I'm sorry, but unless I see Barney at the same time, I... I'll never be sure that Dr. Stangel isn't him.",Lily
"How you doing, Lily?! Should I have a boner?!",Barney
"Okay, we're all done. I'll call you in a few days with the results.",Strangel
Thank you.,Lily
"Hey, you don't mind if I take pictures, do you?!",Barney
Can we leave him in here for a while?,Lily
I'm done for the day. You can leave him in here all night.,Strangel
"Aw, yeah. Smile for the birdie, Lil! Gyno-mite!",Barney
"So, first day of work?",Ted
"Everyone, say hello to your new research associate Robin Scherbatsky.",Woman
"Hi, guys.",Robin
"Oh, here comes our new Hardfire host. Robin, this is Sandy Rivers.",Woman
Sandy Rivers?!,Ted
We should have sex.,Sandy
"Oh, I hate that guy.",Ted
It gets worse.,Robin
"Sandy, this is...",Woman
Robin.,Sandy
You two know each other?,Woman
Know each other? We've had sex.,Sandy
You had sex with Sandy Rivers?,Ted
"No! Ugh! And I can't believe it's my first day, and already I'm the girl who slept with the host of the show.",Robin
Already? Were you planning on eventually sleeping with the host?,Ted
"Well, now that I know it's Sandy, I'm not.",Robin
"Hey, babe.",Marshall
"Hi, honey. There's a couple messages on the machine. Your dad called. He wants to know if you have any sixes.",Lily
"Yeah, uh, we got a game of Go Fish going on the phone. P.S., Pops, go fish. Who's the second message from?",Marshall
Dr. Stangel's office. I'm extremely fertile.,Lily
"You're extremely fertile! Oh, my God. I told you there was nothing to worry about. I got to call my dad and tell him the good news. If you're fertile, um, then that means I'm the problem.",Marshall
"Okay, now you're being ridiculous. An hour ago, you didn't even think there was a problem.",Lily
"Well, I was just putting on a brave face. Okay, think about it: we've had unprotected sex 203 times in the past four months. Obviously I'm the problem.",Marshall
Problem?! You can't get a girl pregnant. That's the dream. I'd give my firstborn to not be able to have children.,Barney
"So, second day of work?",Ted
What's wrong?,Lily
"Oh, you didn't hear? She's the office slut.",Ted
"Already? Oh, honey.",Lily
I wish I was the office slut.,Robin
And we can explore how those policy changes will affect Iraq.,Robin
Yes. We definitely had sex.,Sandy
We did not have sex.,Robin
Then why do I remember you?,Sandy
"I don't know, maybe because I'm a smart, talented, professional.",Robin
"No, none of those. Oh, I remember. We didn't have sex.",Sandy
Thank you.,Robin
You're the girl who did the report on the carriage driver and slipped and fell in horse poop...,Sandy
We did have sex.,Robin
"Oh, I... I remember now. Gregory, do me a favor.",Sandy
But this reporter takes pride in...,Robin
And now everyone calls me Scherpoopie. It's not funny.,Robin
"Robin, a word of advice: play along. Okay, the more you fight it, the worse it's going to get. It's like when your car slides on ice, you steer into the skid.",Ted
"Exactly! Or when your... I don't know... friend invites you to a laser tag tournament, you don't fight it. You just strap on the vinyl holster and race into that abandoned JCPenney g*n a-blazin'. I'm just agreeing with Ted.",Barney
"Oh, it's my dad.",Marshall
Aren't you going to get it?,Ted
"No, no, you know what? Um, I'm gonna get my stuff checked out first. I'll call my dad after Dr. Stangel gives me the thumbs up.",Marshall
He has to do that?,Ted
But I thought you talk to your dad about everything.,Robin
"I only like to call my dad with good news. I mean, telling him good news is what makes it feel real to me.",Marshall
I'm getting married!,Marshall
Yeah...!,Marvin
I passed the bar!,Marshall
All right!,Marvin
"I found an amazing Viking lamp that fits right on the coffee table, as long as we don't mind stepping over the cord.",Marshall
That's what I'm talking about!,Marvin
Right?! I found someone who can fix the Viking lamp!,Marshall
"But the news that I might not be able to give him a grandchild? You know, like, I don't even know how to have that conversation.",Marshall
"I'll show you. Dad, there's, uh, there's something I need to tell you, and it's going to come as a bit of a shock to you, but here goes. You are speaking to the 2011 Tri-County Laser Tag Co-Champion.",Barney
"Barney, I've already told...",Marshall
"Oh, and my sperm don't work. Yeah, yeah, the laser tag thing is awesome.",Barney
"So, third day of work?",Ted
"And the fertilizer is seeping into the ground water, causing...",Robin
Is Scherpoopie pitching a story about manure? Genius.,Sandy
"Okay, yes, I, uh, I fell into some manure. It's hilarious, fine. In a five-year career of on-air reports, there are bound to be a few embarrassing moments.",Robin
A few?,Sandy
"Uh, but in my case, it was just the one, and you found it, so, uh... Just the one.",Robin
Gregory.,Sandy
"Oh, God. What did they find?",Ted
Everything.,Robin
"*Everybody, come and play*... I'm a dirty, dirty girl... *Throw every last care away; Let's go to the mall today; Today, today*... The Federal Reserve Board voted to leave interest... * Let's go to the mall; Today; Let's go to the ma-a-all; Let's got to the mall today; Let's go to the ma-a-all; Today; Let's go to the mall; Today; Let's go to the ma-a-all; Today... ; Let's go to the mall... *",Robin
They even found the video of me getting attacked by an owl.,Robin
You got attacked by an owl?,Ted
I did not get attacked by an owl.,Robin
"Robin, listen, here's what you need to do...",Ted
"Okay, don't you dare tell me to steer into the skid, okay? It's too late. I'm already wrapped around a hydro pole. It's a Canadian telephone pole. I never should have taken this job.",Robin
Show me owl attack.,Ted
I am freaking out. Is there a chance that I can't have kids? I've been hit in the nuts a lot.,Marshall
"Well, we won't know anything until we run some tests. We'll need a sample of your sperm. No, no, no. There's a room at the end of the hall. If you find yourself inside the elevator, you've gone too far. You'd think I wouldn't have to say that, but you'd be surprised.",Stangel
"I can't do it, Doc. Is there, like, another option? Could I... Could I take this home?",Marshall
"Sure, you could, but, uh... we close in an hour and I'm not back till Tuesday. So, clock is ticking. Make it fast.",Stangel
"Only way I know how, Doc. Only way I know how.",Marshall
Surprise!,Marvin
Surprise!,Judy
Mom. Dad. Uh... What are you doing here?,Marshall
We hadn't heard from you in a couple days. We were worried about you.,Judy
"For God's sake, son. Do you have any sixes?",Marvin
"Go fish. Excuse me. Hey, Lily, can I just talk to you in here for a minute?",Marshall
"Oh, yeah. Isn't it great? They just showed up. Your mom's already rearranged my kitchen, organized my closet... and she asked me if I lost height. Not weight. Height.",Lily
"Yeah, I'm very excited that they're here, too. But right now, I have to get excited about something else.",Marshall
"Oh, okay. Well, I'll go handle your parents. And you handle your, well... Wait, wait, wait. Marshall.",Lily
"Thank you, baby. You're the best.",Marshall
"Marshall. Marshall. I just got my new bathing suit for the beach this summer. It's a two-piece. I mean, can you imagine? Me in a two-piece bathing suit at my age? Just picture it! Picture it!",Judy
That's why Fred Cox is the greatest kicker the Vikings ever had.,Marvin
Give me a C. Give me an O. Give me an X. What's that spell? Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox! Cox!,Marvin
"Uh... Okay, I did a bad thing last night. I looked up his address.",Ted
Who?,Robin
Sorry. You said who. It reminded me of the owl footage. Genius. No. Sandy. How dare he laugh at you. Who does he think... Sorry. Who. Anyway. I looked up his address in your contact list.,Ted
"Oh, God. Tell me you didn't go over there.",Robin
I just thought he needed to listen to common sense and reasonable discourse.,Ted
"Oh, God. Tell me those aren't the names of your fists.",Robin
They're my feet. I'm actually more of a kicker. So I went to his apartment.,Ted
Ah... You're not the pizza guy.,Sandy
"Oh, my God. This is...",Robin
"This is how you make sure Sandy never makes fun of you again. I told you to steer into the skid. That was bad advice. So new advice. Steer into Sandy, and run him down.",Ted
If people found out Sandy wears a toupee...,Robin
Really? That's your take-away? Nothing on the bear in the bra?,Ted
"Oh, no. He's very open about that. That's Gregory. Nice guy.",Robin
"And the top is so low-cut. Your father says he has front-row seats to the Minnesota Twins. Oh. Oh. By the way, Marshall, we do need to know if you're coming to Florida this summer. Are you coming? Marshall? Marshall, are you coming?",Judy
This isn't working.,Marshall
"Where you going, son?",Marvin
I'm... I'm going to... I'm... I'm going to...,Marshall
He's going to masturbate.,Lily
Lily!,Marshall
"Marshall, just tell them what's going on.",Lily
"And so, now, I'm just scared that we won't be able to give you a grandchild.",Marshall
"Aw, Marshall. Hey, we don't care about that one bit. And if you guys want kids, there are other ways. Adoption. Maybe you have a good friend who could loan you some sperm?",Judy
"Aw, yeah. Maybe adoption.",Marshall
"What I'm saying is, we love you no matter what. Now, why don't you pretend you're in high school, get back in that bathroom, and blow dry your hair.",Marvin
"Wait, you knew?",Marshall
"We didn't have a hair dryer, dear.",Judy
So? Possibly last day of work?,Ted
"Actually, it was a good day.",Robin
"And I need more numbers on how the holiday season impacted the economy. Sparkles, got anything on malls?",Sandy
"Actually, Sandy, I have something I think you're all gonna want to see.",Robin
Yes! Put him in a body bag!,Ted
"Okay, I didn't do it.",Robin
What?,Ted
I didn't want to just viciously attack someone out of the blue like some kind of...,Robin
Owl?,Ted
"Exactly. So, instead of taking your advice, I took your advice.",Robin
"I'm afraid I have some very bad news, Marshall. Judging from the results of your test, it is... it is very unlikely that you'll be able to father a child.",Stangel
"Oh, God.",Marshall
"I know, I know.",Stangel
It's just...,Marshall
"Now... in some rare cases, a regimen change can fix the problem, so I'm recommending a spirited cardio routine. Preferably with a partner, involving any light-based firearm activity in the Tri-State area. Poughkeepsie, for example. Have you heard of the gentlemen's sport known as laser tag? Surprise!",Stangel
"Damn it, Barney! What are you doing in here?",Marshall
"Think about it, Marshall. All entrants get 20% off at the snack bar! Oh, BT-dub, the receptionist. What's her situation?",Barney
"Go! Well, Marshall. I've got your results.",Stangel
And?,Marshall
Your sperm is fine.,Stangel
My sperm is fine!,Marshall
"Count, motility... everything's off the charts. You, sir, have got some strong swimmers.",Stangel
"Bro, that is awesome. Motility five!",Barney
"Hey, um, can I borrow your phone? I want to call my dad.",Marshall
"Yeah, go ahead.",Ted
"Man, this is great. I was expecting bad news. I really was.",Marshall
"You're here! Oh, my God! I love you so much! Can you believe it?",Marshall
"Marshall... Something's happened. Um... Your father, he had a heart attack. He... he didn't make it.",Lily
My dad's dead? I'm not ready for this.,Marshall
My dad's dead?,Marshall
This is the toughest time in Marshall's life and I feel absolutely useless. What can we do to help?,Ted
"Don't look at me. This morning Marshall said, I have to pee. And I, Don't worry, baby, I'll do it for you. Halfway through the pee, I'm, like, This doesn't even make sense!",Lily
"Well, uh, I've been to a couple funerals, so I know my role: I'm Vice Girl. Whatever Marshall needs to get through this day, I got it right here.",Robin
"Cigarettes, alcohol... Are these firecrackers? My God, Robin, you somehow crammed Tijuana into a purse.",Ted
"Marshall's mom hasn't eaten, slept or sat down since we got here. Wait! That can be my role! I'll take care of Judy!",Lily
"Yeah, but doesn't Marshall's mom hate you--the fact that you two aren't very close?",Robin
"Okay, yes, Judy and I aren't besties, but today, whatever she needs, I'm there. I'm on Judy duty.",Lily
Judy duty.,Ted
She said doody.,Barney
"Really, guys? At a funeral?",Robin
"Uh, okay, while not all of us possess your lofty sense of decorum, Drug-DealerFrom-An-'80s-After-School-Special, we have to laugh today. It's healthy.",Ted
"Wait a minute! Today, we are gonna make Marshall laugh.",Barney
How?,Robin
"Ted, what's the one thing that always cracks him up?",Barney
Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts.,Ted
"Internet footage of a guy getting hit in the nuts, exactly! So we are gonna get our bro a four-star nad rattler. You search knees, feet, banisters, fire hydrants and diving boards, and I'll cover bats, rackets, hockey sticks, golf clubs and riding crops.",Barney
What about animals?,Ted
"Uh... Claws, paws, talons, hooves, beaks and clenched monkey fists. We can do this!",Barney
"Hey, guys, sorry, uh... I left my charger back in New York, so my phone's out of juice. Does anyone have...?",Marshall
Outlet or USB?,Robin
"Uh, outlet. Thank you. Oh...",Marshall
"Wow, you really do have everything in there, don't you?",Lily
"You're like Mary Poppins, if her magic purse was also filled with drugs.",Ted
"If? Ted, the kids in that movie jumped into a painting and spent 15 minutes chasing a cartoon fox. Spoonful of sugar...? Grow up.",Robin
"I'm so sorry for your loss, Judy.",Reverend
"Thank you, Reverend.",Judy
"Unfortunately, I can't. My daughter in Chicago just went into labor. But I'm leaving you in the capable hands of my second-in-command: my son.",Reverend
Your son?,Marshall
"Oh, you remember Trey. I'll go grab him.",Reverend
"Guys... Trey Platt terrorized me growing up. He was, he was the toughest bully in school.",Marshall
'Sup Marshall.,Trey
"Hello, Trey. Long time. Mm-hmm. I was not aware that you had become a reverend.",Marshall
"Yeah, well, your lunch money finally ran out. Kidding!",Trey
"Marshall Eriksen, you could use a laugh.",Barney
"Yeah! This video is entitled, Little League Coach Gets Hit in the Nuts by a Foul Ball and Then Vomits in a Garbage Can. I don't wanna give anything away. Let's just watch.",Ted
"See? 'Cause, 'cause he got hit...",Barney
"...right in the nuts,",Ted
Trey Platt. I can't believe my father's funeral service is being led by Trey The Noogie Machine Platt.,Marshall
"That guy gave you noogies? What, did he carry a stepladder?",Ted
He made me carry it.,Marshall
"So, my dad has these questions he asks to help create a theme for the service, or whatever. Question one: What were your last words with the deceased? Lame. Question two:",Trey
Wait... My last words with Marvin were lovely. I've been thinking about them a lot.,Judy
"Well, this is clearly yielding nothing. Thanks, Dad. Guess I'll have to fill the time with some jokes... again.",Trey
"Last words seems like a good theme. Marshall, do you remember the last thing your father said to you?",Judy
"Bye, sweetie.",Judy
"Bye, Mom.",Marshall
"Son, there's something I want to say before I leave.",Marvin
"Yeah, Dad?",Marshall
Could I snag that extra pork chop for the flight?,Marvin
"I was gonna make a sandwich with that, Dad. Dad, don't they have food on the plane?",Marshall
"Yeah, but plane food is ass.",Marvin
"Plane food is ass. Those are the last words my father will ever say to me. Right after I denied the man a pork chop. Oh, God. Wait! I'm wrong! I'm wrong! That wasn't it! They couldn't find a cab so my dad called up from the street.",Marshall
Marshall! Looks like rain out here! I couldn't find an umbrella in your closet! You know who probably has an umbrella?,Marvin
"And then, well, see, my dad grew up in a small town, in another generation, so sometimes - totally well-meaningly - he'd say stuff like...",Marshall
"The Koreans across the hall! Hey, the Koreans are a trustworthy and generous people!",Marvin
Dad...,Marshall
"I betcha one of the Koreans has an umbrella! Heck, they're Koreans!",Marvin
My dad's last words to me were a string of odd racial stereotypes.,Marshall
All that stuff was really nice!,Robin
Yeah! It's positive racism!,Lily
This is worse than the pork chop.,Marshall
"This next clip is entitled, Guy Playing Bagpipes Gets Hit in the Nuts by Low-Flying Seagull",Barney
Let's see what happens.,Ted
Here he comes... Oh! Oh! 'Cause he gets hit right in the nuts.,Barney
And then the fat kid loses his swim trunks.,Ted
Fall off. Shorts just fall right off.,Barney
"No, wait-- I'm wrong. That wasn't it. They couldn't find a cab, so I went down there.",Marshall
"Hey, you were right. The Kangs did, in fact, have an umbrella.",Marshall
Of course they did.,Marvin
"Bye, sweetie.",Judy
"Bye, Mom.",Marshall
"Hey, son, I just want to leave you with a little advice. Rent Crocodile Dundee III. I caught it on the cable last night. It totally holds up!",Marvin
"Crocodile Dundee III is the second-best of the Croc trilogy, so maybe I can live with that",Marshall
"I, uh, I hear you're a woman who can get things.",Man
I've been known to locate certain objects from time to time.,Robin
I need vodka and dirty playing cards.,Man
I got ya.,Robin
"Oh, my God.",Marshall
What is it?,Lily
I have a voice mail from my dad.,Marshall
You have a voice mail from your dad?,Lily
How?,Robin
"My phone's been out of juice, so he must've called me the day the he, uh...",Marshall
"Baby, are you okay?",Lily
I hold in my hand the last words my father will ever say to me. I'm gonna hit play.,Marshall
What's wrong?,Robin
What if it's worse than Crocodile Dundee III? I can't do this. I can't... My mom is about to collapse. I'm gonna...,Marshall
"Wait-- no, no, baby... Baby, I got it. Let me.",Lily
You should listen to it. Just don't put too much pressure on it.,Robin
"She's right. I mean, this idea that someone's last words have to be profound and meaningful? I mean, who can live up to that?",Ted
"Exactly. All those famous last word people supposedly said? They're all made up. Like that patriotic dude, Nathan Hale, from third-grade history?",Barney
You know what his real last words were?,Barney
True story.,Barney
"The point is, last words are overrated.",Robin
"Look, think of it this way: you get to hear your dad's voice one last time.",Ted
"I should go listen to this... alone, okay? I'll be back.",Marshall
"Hey, so, um, I heard you might have...",Woman
You heard right. ,Robin
"Guys, listen to what just happened.",Lily
"Judy, do you need a break? I'm happy to cook for a while.",Lily
"You think your snobby New York cooking is better than mine-- admit it! Well, go ahead, Lily, why don't you just whip up a batch of your fancy tofu sushi bagels! And choke on them!",Judy
Whoa. Are you okay?,Ted
Listen!,Lily
I'm gonna go take a nap.,Judy
"Judy's finally sleeping and it's all because of me! Guys, I have a role: I'm Judy's bitch! Yeah!",Lily
"Well, but this day is tough on you, too. You sure you can absorb all that?",Ted
"Yeah! Robin gave me a little orange pill from her purse. I don't know what's in it, but things are flowin' pretty smooth right now.",Lily
"Hey, stay hydrated.",Robin
So?,Barney
"I couldn't listen to it. Guys, this is hard.",Marshall
"We know, baby. But you'll always wonder, if you don't. Your dad loved you. It almost doesn't matter what he said.",Lily
It doesn't. That's true.,Barney
"Guys, guys, what if-- God forbid-- all of your dads died right now? What would their last words to you have been? Seriously.",Marshall
"I know mine. When I was in Cleveland last month, I went to visit my dad at his... post-divorce bachelor pad.",Ted
Yeah... so glad we can we can talk about our sex lives now. That's totally an improvement.,Ted
My prom date?!,Ted
I have to go.,Ted
How would you like those to be your father's last words?,Marshall
"Well, they might be. Donna Bromstead's husband is a cop.",Ted
Lawyered. Lily?,Marshall
Hello.,Lily
Fooled ya. Leave a message after the beep. We'll get back to ya. Beep.,Lily
Lawyered. Robin?,Marshall
That's awful.,Ted
"No, here's the awful part.",Robin
You remembered my birthday!,Robin
"Lawyered. Now can we all just admit that last words are, in fact, a big deal?",Marshall
Yes.,Everyone
"Man, I always thought I had it rough not really knowing my dad, but... now I realize at least I'll never have to suffer like this. Our next video is called German Shepherd Activates Tennis Ball Cannon While Fat Kid Sips Energy Drink.",Barney
"Barney, please, Barney! It's... No more videos, okay? I just need a minute.",Marshall
"Okay... okay, who is responsible for this? Who got Cousin Daphne drunk? She is 15 years old.",Judy
"Whoa, they grow big out here.",Robin
And here's your phone number back.,Barney
"Judy, I...",Robin
I did it.,Lily
What possible excuse could you have for this?,Judy
I'm from New York. We think getting minors drunk is funny.,Lily
"There's nothing funny about getting minors drunk! You should be ashamed, Lily! Ashamed! Mmm! Oh, cripes, that's tasty. Mmm! Mmm!",Judy
"That salad's the first food she's eaten in two days. Sure, it's mostly cheese, mayonnaise and jelly beans, but it counts.",Lily
"Well, at least someone's helping. We haven't made Marshall laugh once.",Ted
Yeah. Showing videos of guys getting hit in the nuts wasn't going to do anything. I'm just stupid.,Barney
Stupid.,Ted
What we need to do is hit each other in the nuts.,Barney
Yes. Nothing b*at the immediacy of live theater. But which one of us is going to take the hit?,Ted
"I'm not going to listen. Rent Crocodile Dundee II are the last words that my father will ever say to me, and I think I can live with that.",Marshall
Is he laughing?,Ted
My last talk with Marvin was so lovely.,Judy
And then he kissed me and he said...,Judy
"You know something, gorgeous, I'm the luckiest man alive.",Judy
These stories suck.,Ted
Doesn't hold a candle to your Crocodile Dundee thing.,Robin
"You're up next, baby.",Lily
I just need some air.,Marshall
"Baby, are you okay?",Lily
I have to listen to it. It's a pocket dial. It's nothing.,Marshall
"Hey, so it's a pocket dial. You have so many great memories with your dad. Who cares about the last one?",Lily
She's right. Your dad was hilarious.,Barney
"You guys don't get it, okay? None of you do. My dad was my hero. And he was my teacher. And he was my best friend. He always came through for me. And now he's just gone. And what am I left with? (",Marshall
Looks like your dad came through one last time.,Lily
I love you. My father's last words to me are I love you.,Marshall
I love you. My father's last words to me are I love you.,Marshall
"Yes. Yes, they were. We heard it. Loud and clear.",Everyone
"Bye, Pop.",Marshall
Then my father said the last words that he'll ever say to me: Rent Crocodile Dundee III. I caught it on the cable last night and it totally holds up.,Marshall
Thanks.,Judy
For what?,Lily
I know what you've been doing today. And I really needed it.,Judy
Any time.,Lily
"That dress makes you look like a Kansas City whore. Sorry, dear. Last one.",Judy
"Oh, man. I should have rented Crocodile Dundee III.",Marshall
"Okay, seriously, how are you doing that?",Ted
"Thanks. I'll be right back. And if I don't come back, well, then these are my last words to you all. I really, really, really love you guys. Now I'm going to go drop a deuce.",Marshall
"Hi, Dad.",Ted
"Hi, Dad.",Lily
"Hi, Dad.",Robin
"Hey, Mom. I'm ready to meet my dad.",Barney
"Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.",Marshall
"No. It's called manners, jerk. Now, what's-what's going on in New York? Give me something.",Marshall
"There is one thing that's been going on. Uh, it's about Ted... and Zoey.",Robin
I thought the oven was Celsius.,Robin
It's okay. We got hot dogs.,Ted
"Yeah, and it's not like you can screw up a hot dog. Oh, God. This is so good. I'm gonna finish it in the bathroom.",Lily
Could someone pass the ketchup?,Zoey
I hope I can pass this hot dog.,Barney
Oh.Oops.,Zoey
"Well, looks like someone's going out in the cold to get more ketchup.",Ted
"Oh, come on, man, I brought the wine.",Zoey
Which is all gone.,Ted
"All right, I tell you what... you get this one bottle, I'll get the next three.",Zoey
"Hmm, tell you what... no dice.",Ted
I'll get the next hundred.,Zoey
You're not getting out of this.,Ted
You want to go on a date with my hot cousin?,Zoey
I'll get the ketchup.,Ted
"Robin, I just want you to know, it's either this story you're telling me or another game of Clue against myself, so make it good.",Marshall
"Oh, it's good. You see, after that night, none of us heard from Zoey for a while.",Robin
"Finally, Ted called her up.",Robin
Hello.,Zoey
"So are we ever gonna see you again? Because, if I recall correctly, you owe me a date with your hot cousin.",Ted
You still want to do that?,Zoey
Yes. And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.,Ted
"Don't worry, Ted, she's cute.",Zoey
She's not fat.,Zoey
"Oh, here she is.",Zoey
"Hey, Zoey.",Honey
"Hey. Ted, this is my cousin...",Zoey
Honey.,Honey
"Hi, Honey, I'm Ted.",Ted
"She is a lovely person... warm, intelligent, just kind of gullible. It's like, every word out of her mouth makes you want to be like, Oh, honey.",Robin
Interesting. Show your work.,Marshall
My apartment building is so safe. My landlord... he even installed a security camera in my shower.,Honey
"Oh, honey.",Marshall
"Maybe I should feel weird about giving a stranger my Social Security number, but the guy's a Nigerian prince.",Honey
"Oh, honey.",Marshall
I just had a great TV audition. Behind the KFC where the executive producer works on the weekends.,Honey
"Oh, honey.",Marshall
"Long story short, I'm going to be on Lost.",Honey
"Oh, honey.",Marshall
"I know. You just want to wrap her up in a blanket and give her a cup of tea. She's, like, this little lost lamb who needs to be protected from the wolves. Speaking of whom...",Robin
"Yeah, I always get those e- mails from Michelle Obama and sometimes Obama himself.",Honey
"Oh, honey.",Barney
"So the night went on, and eventually everyone went home, except for Ted and Honey.",Robin
"Wow, an architect. How fascinating.",Honey
Why do they call 'em coasters?,Barney
And Barney.,Robin
"Okay, time to go home.",Honey
"Ted, a word. God, I hate these situations. What are we gonna do about this?",Barney
What are you talking about?,Ted
"Come on, Ted, it's obvious. Honey's vibing on me.",Barney
What?,Ted
It's called body language. Remember when she was touching your arm and leaning in real close?,Barney
Mm-hmm.,Ted
"Well, while that was happening, the straw in her drink was pointed right at me. I mean... that's as clear as a signal gets, so... I'm so sorry, man.",Barney
"You're right. She's all yours, buddy. I'd say hump her brains out, but someone obviously already has.",Ted
"Good for you. Ted Mosby does not take advantage of poor, helpless honeys.",Robin
"Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.",Ted
Hmm?,Robin
He's gay!,Judy
"Mom, hang up!",Marshall
I'm sorry.,Judy
Go on.,Marshall
"Yeah, actually, there's another reason that I didn't go home with her.",Ted
Hmm?,Robin
I'm in love with Zoey.,Ted
"Oh, my God.",Marshall
"Oh, my God!",Judy
Mom!,Marshall
Sorry.,Judy
"Ted's in love with Zoey? But, but she's married. That boy needs an intervention.",Marshall
Funny you should say that.,Robin
Does anyone know why we're here?,Barney
"Yeah, who called this intervention?",Lily
I did. It's for me. This is about the coffee breath.,Ted
Finally.,Lily
"Hmm, no, it's the shoulder hair.",Robin
"Guys, just let the man explain how it's all about his wearing a lady's watch.",Barney
"It's because I'm in love with Zoey, and she's married, so it needs to stop. And... intervene.",Ted
Are you sure it's love?,Lily
"Remember the ketchup bottle? She wasn't the one who dropped it. When she reached for it, our fingers touched, and...",Ted
Marcus! This is a private conversation! So what'd the wuss do next?,Marshall
"This is love. And this was my grandmother's watch. Anyway, now I have only one course of action in front of me: I have to end my friendship with Zoey.",Ted
Isn't that a little harsh?,Robin
"Harsh? Robin, a single guy and a married woman cannot be friends if one's in love with the other.",Lily
"Yeah, but Zoey is friends with us now, too. It's not like Ted can just ghost out on her. She'll always be around.",Robin
Then what am I supposed to do?,Ted
"Okay, just shut it down. Okay, just ignore your feelings. If-If she asks you for ketchup, tell her to get it her own damn self. Look, I like Zoey. Without her, my dinner party wouldn't have been such a success. So those feelings of yours... shut 'em down.",Robin
Fine. I'll shut 'em down.,Ted
"And seriously, mouthwash after coffee.",Lily
"Oh, um, that's my other line. It's not a number I recognize.",Marshall
So don't answer it.,Robin
Yeah.,Marshall
"Well, it would be. Good-bye. Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking.",Marshall
"Hey, Marshall.",Barney
Barney. W- What number is this?,Marshall
"I'm up on burners, playa. Too many crazies had my old number, so now I'm all about disposable cell phones. I'll use one for a while, have my fun, then dump it and get a new one. And then I'll do the same with my phone.",Barney
"Hey, uh, so Robin told me about this whole Ted and Zoey thing.",Marshall
"Dude, she doesn't know how to tell a story. I'll tell you that story.",Barney
"Hey, Zoey.",Honey
"Ted, this is my cousin...",Zoey
Honey.,Honey
Uh... Robin's version was...,Marshall
"That is exactly how it happened. So Ted did his best to impress her, but as per yoozh, he bored the pants very much on her.",Barney
"Blah, blah, blah, I'm an architect. Blah, blah, blah, I don't wear suits. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.",Ted
"Wow, an architect. How fascinating.",Honey
"Blah, blah, blah, blah. Rambling architecture anecdote. Blah, blah, something about a bridge. Blah, blah, blah...",Ted
"Okay, time to go home.",Honey
"Anyway, I get Honey back to her place.",Barney
Who's your daddy?,Barney
"Okay, can we skip this part, please?",Marshall
"Sure, I'll just summarize it. ",Barney
"Okay, that's been going on a while.",Marshall
"Only way I know how. Any-who, next day, I'm going into work. I run into Zoey.",Barney
"Hey, Zoey. That cousin of yours... Honey... yowsa! I must say, your family tree has got a couple of pretty big coconuts.",Barney
Thanks.,Zoey
"Yeah, we had a great time last night. And then just hand stuff in the morning, so...",Barney
"Wait, she didn't go home with Ted?",Zoey
"Nope, he let me have her. I have to say, it was pretty noble of him. He fell on his sword so that she could fall on mine. I won't bore you with the details, but to summarize... (",Barney
She hugged me. What was that all about?,Barney
Zoey's in love with Ted.,Marcus
Marcus!,Marshall
"Wait, hear me out, Marshall. Zoey's in love with Ted, but she's married, so she tried to push him away by setting him up with her cousin instead. But seeing Ted and Honey hit it off was more than her gentle heart could bear, so Zoey left early, pricked by love's fickle thorn. But then, the next morning, upon learning that Ted had not tasted of Honey's sweet nectar, her joy burst forth like a blossoming flower in spring.",Marcus
Wow. Zoey's in love with Ted.,Marshall
"Oh, Marshall, I stopped by that new doughnut shop Hertz Donuts. Would you like a Hertz Donut?",Marcus
"Sure. Hey, where's the...? No! Aah!",Marshall
"Hurts, don't it? I can't believe you fell for that, bro.",Marcus
"So Ted's in love with Zoey and Zoey's in love with Ted? Well, that-that's not going to work. I got to call Ted.",Marshall
Hello.,Ted
"Listen, Ted, um, I got to tell you something about Zoey.",Marshall
"Yeah, yeah. I need to tell you something about Zoey, too.",Ted
Hey. I was in the neighborhood and I thought I'd take you up on that beer you're about to offer me.,Zoey
Can I get you a beer?,Ted
"Oh, Ted, I'm so busy. But I guess I got time for one. Lead the way.",Zoey
"What?! Fridge full of ketchup? How? How, I ask you? What?",Zoey
"Listen, Zoey, I, um... I need to tell you something. Um...",Ted
"Marshall, I'm going to Byerly's. You want anything?",Judy
Mom! Get off the phone!,Marshall
"Could you get some more Bugles, please?",Marcus
"Of course, dear.",Judy
"Marcus, hang up! Both of you, hang up! And we need ice cream. Go on.",Marshall
"I, uh... I can't be friends with you anymore. And this may seem strange, but... you can't ask me why.",Ted
Wow. Okay.,Zoey
And that was it. No more Zoey.,Ted
"Oh. Hey, buddy, that's Lily. I should take that. But, uh, you're a good guy, Ted. Hey, baby.",Marshall
We hate Ted now. Get on board or the sexting stops.,Lily
"Ted's a son of a bitch!  Oh, nice. But, hey, um, baby, go easy on Ted, okay? He just, he just ended things with Zoey.",Marshall
"Oh, I know. But did he tell you the whole story?",Lily
"I, uh, I can't be friends with you anymore. And you can't ask me why.",Ted
Why?,Zoey
Lily hates you.,Ted
You hate me?,Zoey
That's crazy. I don't hate you.,Lily
"Well, I know that's not true, Lily. Ted told me everything.",Zoey
"He... Oh, really? And-And what did Ted say, exactly?",Lily
Lily hates you. She hates you so much it's hard to be around you. So we can't be friends.,Ted
"Oh, he... Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay, well, I- I guess there's no use hiding it anymore. I- I hate you. Bitch.",Lily
I can't believe it. I really thought you and I were friends. Lord knows I could use a friend right now. I've been going through some pretty difficult stuff.,Zoey
Difficult stuff? What difficult stuff?,Marshall
I don't know.,Lily
"Well, you did the right thing, baby.",Marshall
Not entirely.,Lily
"Zoey, wait! I don't hate you! We just can't be friends anymore because... Robin hates you.",Lily
And that's Robin on the other line.,Marshall
"Oh, well, I'll let you take that. Love you, baby!",Lily
"Eriksen residence, Marshall speaking... Listen, Robin. I know. I apologize for my wife. She never should have...",Marshall
"Yeah, I told Zoey you hate her.",Robin
Me? You dragged me into this?!,Marshall
You just went through a tragedy. It's not like she's gonna call you up and...,Robin
"Oh, God, that's my other line. Oh, God, it's a 917 number, and I don't recognize it! I think it's Zoey!",Marshall
Just don't answer it.,Robin
I can't not answer. It's impolite.,Marshall
"Marshall, you can b*at this.",Robin
I can't turn my back on politeness.,Marshall
You don't have to answer. You can just let it ring.,Robin
Good manners are what separate us from those elbows on the table Wisconsinites.,Marshall
"You can do this. I believe in you. Don't do it, Marshall!",Robin
"I'm sorry, Robin! Eriksen residence. Marshall speaking.",Marshall
"Hi. I spent the night with your friend Barney and he accidentally left his phone in my apartment, in the garbage. But I've been going through all of his contacts because I'm sure he wants to get in touch with me. After all, he told me, uh... I was his first.",Honey
"Oh, honey. Oh! Honey! Zoey's cousin.",Marshall
Hi.,Honey
"Listen, um, about Barney...",Marshall
"Oh, yeah. He's such a sweet guy.",Honey
Who's your daddy?,Barney
I guess he recently decided to get in touch with his dad. His mom gave him the guy's address.,Honey
So I wrote him a letter. And I poured my heart out. And I gave him my number and I told him to call me. And he still hasn't called me.,Barney
"Oh, honey.",Honey
"I mean, I shouldn't be surprised. Clearly, he wants nothing to do with me.",Barney
"Oh, honey.",Honey
"I mean, why else would he let 30 years go by? He's ashamed to have me as a son.",Barney
"Oh, honey, he's not ashamed of you. He's ashamed of himself. I mean, look at you. You're do so great without him. I mean, you have an airline and three Nobel Prizes, and you play for the Yankees.",Honey
Four. Four Nobel Prizes.,Barney
"Four. See? That is impressive. I mean, how many does he have?",Honey
Only three.,Barney
"Well, there you go.",Honey
"Hey, uh, listen, Honey, while I've got you, do you have any idea what kind of difficult stuff Zoey's been going through?",Marshall
"Oh, I can't tell you about that. The only people that are allowed to know are me, Zoey and her therapist.",Honey
I am her therapist.,Marshall
"Oh! Well, in that case...",Honey
"Uh, okay, listen, I think we've made great progress for today. I got to go. Bye. Mom! Marcus!",Marshall
What's this really about?,Zoey
I told you. Lily hates you.,Ted
"I think you hate me. I think you have some big problem with me, and you're too chicken to come out and say it.",Zoey
All right. Yes. I... hate you.,Ted
Great. See? Was that so hard?,Zoey
Zoey.,Ted
"Can you at least tell me why? Because I'm racking my brain here, and I thought... I just want to know why.",Zoey
"So we got Ted and Zoey. Ted is in love with Zoey. Zoey has no idea. Then Zoey's cousin Honey went home with Barney, and Zoey was happy about it. Which tells us what?",Marshall
Zoey's in love with...,Marcus
"Zoey's in love with Ted and Ted doesn't know. So Ted and Zoey... they're in love with each other, which would be fine if Zoey wasn't married to Colonel Mustard. I mean, The Captain. Except now, as Honey informs me...",Marshall
And we miss you. But the cousin thing mostly. Let's get that going.,Ted
"Fine, I will, uh, make it happen. Good-bye. Okay. Well... I guess I'll take it.",Zoey
Zoey and The Captain are getting divorced. Which means...?,Marshall
"So help me, Marshall, if you don't call those two crazy, mixed-up kids, I will.",Marcus
Give me that phone.,Marshall
"Why do I hate you? Are you kidding? Uh, you're actively trying to prevent me from realizing a lifelong dream. So there's that. Plus, you're stubborn and-and-and argumentative. And what kind of name is Zoey, huh? What is that, short for Zoseph? ",Ted
"Hello. Oh, hey, Marshall...Yes, I am...Yes, I am...He is?...Bye.",Zoey
Why was Marshall calling?,Ted
Don't worry about it. Go on.,Zoey
"You talk during movies. You-You-You sneeze with your whole body. Uh, to my knowledge, you do not speak Portuguese.",Ted
"Well, actually... ",Zoey
You're a show-off.,Ted
You better take that.,Zoey
"Uh, hey, Marshall, can I call you back? I'm out in the hallway with... She is? She is? Marshall, I got to go.",Ted
They're kissing.,Neighbour
They're kissing?! Yeah! (,Marshall
"Look, um... I know you're going through a lot right now. Getting divorced, being single, figuring out who you are on your own.",Ted
Someone knows how to set a mood.,Zoey
I just mean... I'm okay taking this slow. I want to do this right.,Ted
"You're doing this all wrong! Ted, there are couples in my kindergarten class who have moved faster than you two. Granted, their home lives are not great.",Barney
"Hey, I'm trying. I keep suggesting these big, romantic dates, and she keeps putting on the brakes. Like tonight, she wants me to just come over and bake cookies.",Ted
Oh. Translation: booty-call.,Robin
Total booty-call.,Barney
"Private Booty, reporting for duty.",Lily
That's crazy. She-She wants to bake.,Ted
"Guys booty-call girls after 2:00 a.m. with a drunkenly slurred, What ya doing? But when a lady booty-calls a guy, she invents a respectable excuse to mask the fact that she wants to get stuck real good.",Robin
"It's called class, Ted.",Lily
Wait. That... You think that's what she means by baking cookies?,Ted
"Are you kidding? You're in the kitchen, it's getting hot, you start licking stuff off each others' fingers. Before you know it, she's bent over the marble island, and you're spanking her with a rubber spatula. And she's screaming, Stop, Marshall, stop, but that's just code for harder!",Lily
"Marshall's been in Minnesota a while, huh?",Ted
So long! And now he's staying even longer. His mom has been having a really hard time since the funeral. He's waiting on her hand and foot. But... it's Valentine's Day. It's not going to be the same without the two of us watching Predator together.,Lily
"You know, I saw this in the theater, like, five times, but I never got to see it with the right girl.",Marshall
I'm so glad none of those girls were right for you.,Lily
What girls?,Marshall
"Wow, you sound really lonely.",Barney
"I am. Earlier today, I burst into tears...",Lily
"Shh. Daddy's talking now. Loneliness. The looming specter of Valentine's Day fast approaching. The two key ingredients to my favorite day of the year, February 13: Desperation Day.",Barney
That's not a thing.,Robin
"It's a thing. Much like Valentine's Day itself, Desperation Day dates back thousands of years. Weddings were forbidden under ancient Roman law, so Saint Valentine performed them in secret, under threat of death.",Barney
That's actually true.,Ted
"Wait, there's more.",Barney
This won't be.,Ted
"And right by Saint Valentine's side was his best bro, Saint Desperatius, there to pick off insecure bridesmaids.",Barney
"Oh, Jupiter, what are your plans for me? 15 and still unmarried.",Woman
"Every woman wants a date on Valentine's Day. That neediness reaches its climax... what up... on February 13. A magical night when a ten has the self-esteem of a four and the depraved enthusiasm of a two. Now, there's only one thing you can't do.",Barney
Please say widows.,Robin
"Wherever you are, or whoever you're under, you must get home alone by 11:59 p.m. Otherwise, you're on a date on Valentine's Day.",Barney
"Barney, Desperation Day assumes that all single women freak out about Valentine's Day. Which we do not. Case in point, I will be spending February 13 with some lovely single ladies from work...",Robin
Trolls.,Barney
...who could care less about Valentine's Day.,Robin
Lying trolls.,Barney
"And we will be celebrating the fact that we don't have to spend it with some dippy guy carting around roses and stuffed toys all night. Oh, no offense, Ted.",Robin
And none was taken until just then.,Ted
I decided to go to Minnesota to see Marshall. He shouldn't have to help his mom through this rough time all by himself.,Lily
"You losing your mind, being alone in your apartment?",Barney
I'm getting weird!,Lily
"See, it started off with me throwing Marshall's jersey on my body pillow. And, well, things kind of spiraled from there. I'm sorry I yelled like that before.",Lily
I call him Marshpillow. And he calls me... nothing because he's a pillow.,Lily
Hey. How was baking cookies last night?,Robin
Uh... Is that an overnight bag?,Zoey
You brought an overnight bag?,Lily
You guys said I was definitely going to spend the night.,Ted
"We said you were going to have sex. We didn't say, Bring a carry-on.",Barney
So how did Zoey react?,Robin
She thought it was presumptuous and asked me to leave. It's-It's not like I brought a ton of stuff.,Ted
Were there slippers for the morning?,Robin
"Not slippers, exactly.",Ted
They're called British morning socks.,Ted
This is such a nice surprise. Marshall will be so happy.,Judy
"How are you holding up, Judy?",Lily
"Oh, I'm doin' okay. It gets a little lonely. My friends suggested a body pillow, but...(",Judy
"Hey, Mom? I hate to be that guy, but I'm pretty sure it was Hot Pocket o'clock, like, ten minutes ago. Lily. What are you doing here?",Marshall
I wanted to surprise you.,Lily
"Oh, my gosh. That's so sweet. I'm so glad you're here. Hey, um, before I forget, Mom, did you remember to get more double-A batteries?",Marshall
"Oh, they're upstairs, sweetie. Right next to your washed and folded clothes.",Judy
"Oh, great, okay. I don't want my Game Boy to crap out. I'm having the sickest Dr. Mario run of my life. Okay. I'll be right back. I love you, Lily. Okay. You're the best, Mom.",Marshall
"Aw... Anything for my baby bear. Get him out of my house. Take Marshall back to New York with you. Please, I am begging you.",Judy
I thought he was here helping you.,Lily
"Well, he was, at first. But once he saw me starting to do better, he kind of regressed. He's been holed up in his room for days at a time, playing old video games. I mean, he is having a pretty sick Dr. Mario run, but...",Judy
"Uh, I'll talk to him.",Lily
"I want to be there for him, but it's like he's a teenager again. I even walked in on him abusing himself.",Judy
"Oh, God.",Lily
"There he was, on the bed, looking at old photos of his dad. That's emotional self-abuse, don't you think?",Judy
"Listen, that was a dumb move for me to just assume...",Ted
"No, no, I overreacted. I mean, I invited you over to bake cookies. We both knew what that meant.",Zoey
We totally did.,Ted
"I just, you know... I saw those slippers in your bag, and suddenly everything felt really serious. And... ever since, I've been asking myself, Am I ready for this? And... the answer is yes.",Zoey
They're actually called British morning socks.,Ted
Yeah. Don't get in your own way.,Zoey
Right. Okay.,Ted
"Um, Marshall, your mom asked me to carry this up. She turned her ankle on your Hot Wheels. Is my track okay? It's fine, but, Marshall, I thought you were here taking care of your mom. It seems like she's taking care of you.",Lily
"My mom loves to feel needed. Letting her take care of me is how I'm taking care of her. She's in a dark place, Lily. She needs this. Mom? You forgot my chocolate milk with the swirly straw!",Marshall
Oops. Comin' right up!,Judy
"Marshall, tomorrow's Valentine's. Don't you want to be at home on our couch, cuddling up under a warm blanket, watching the Predator use his heat vision to stalk helpless prey?",Lily
"Well, baby, we could watch Predator here. No, my mom can go rent it for us after she's done digging out the car.",Marshall
"Marshall, your mom wants you out of here.",Lily
What?,Marshall
"Anything else, sweetie?",Judy
"Mom, d-do you want me to leave?",Marshall
"Heavens to Bess, no! Of course not!",Judy
"But, Judy, you said...",Lily
"Oh, if Marshall could stay here forever, I would be the happiest mom in Minnesota.",Judy
So Valentine's Day is tomorrow.,Zoey
"Yeah. You know, there's this new Italian restaurant on 79th that's supposed to be amazing.",Ted
"I would be happier having just a simple, home-cooked meal. As long as it's with you.",Zoey
"Tomorrow night, my place.",Ted
"I'm ready for this, Ted. I am in it for the long haul. I can't wait for our first Valentine's Day as a couple. The one we'll remember for years.",Zoey
Isn't that great?,Ted
"Yeah, if you say so, yeah.",Robin
What do you mean?,Ted
"Look, she just got out of a marriage, Ted. That's heavy. I'm kind of freaking out, just listening to you. My heart is pounding, I'm hearing this weird clicking noise.",Robin
"Well, it's romantic, right? Zoey and I are getting serious on Valentine's Day.",Ted
"See, that just amps up the pressure even more. Boy, it's a good thing that you're sure.",Robin
"Who said I wasn't sure? I'm glad we're in a serious relationship. Right away. And if I screw this up, I'm the devil, because she's going through a divorce. But I'm not going to screw this up. So stop freaking out, Robin. Stop freaking out!",Ted
Hi! I'm here to help Marshall.,Ted
"God, these girls are so hungry for male attention. It is like being a hunter and having the deer walk up, tie itself to the hood of your car and beg to get mounted.",Barney
"Barney, this is Bev and Anna, uh, my coworkers and my friends. Bev, Anna, this is Barney, a high-functioning sociopath and my ex.",Robin
Enchant√©. That's French for What's with the purple?,Barney
"Well, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, and everything is pink and red, so Bev very thoughtfully suggested that we wear purple to show how little we care.",Robin
"I use, uh, colors to express emotion. Purple is for pride. It was a stupid idea.",Bev
"Bev, you look at me. It's not a stupid idea. Tonight, we are queens.",Anna
"And we don't care about some stupid, sexist, corporate holiday.",Robin
Please! You might as well be dog-earing a tear-stained bridal magazine while wolfing down the box of chocolates you had delivered to yourself at work from your fianc√© who no one's ever met.,Barney
Gerard is real!,Bev
Ted... I thought you were going to talk to Marshall about coming back to New York.,Lily
"Yeah, but, you know, things move so fast in New York. Why not hang out here until at least after Valentine's Day. Plus, we're helping Marshall's mom. Uh, Mrs. Eriksen, we're running low on SunnyD!",Ted
Is orange juice okay?,Judy
"Okay, when your fianc√© Gerard comes back from fixing cleft palates in Peru, maybe snatch a photo of the two of you together, and then I'll totally believe you.",Barney
"Well, he's going to Kenya after Peru, so...",Bev
"Hey, guys, so sorry I'm late.",Nora
"Hey. Hey, Nora. Uh, Nora, this is Barney. You want to see Anna b*at him in an arm wrestle?",Robin
My elbow slipped!,Barney
"Marshall, I'm going home.",Lily
What?,Marshall
"I'm flying out tonight before the big storm, and I want you to come with me.",Lily
"I can't right now, 'cause my mom needs me.",Marshall
While I'm sure it's been really helpful for her to have you here playing Super Mario Kart for 14 hours a day...,Lily
You have Super Mario Kart?!,Ted
"Hell, yeah.",Marshall
But your mom doesn't need you. Your life in New York needs you. It needs you really bad.,Lily
"Baby, don't go.",Marshall
Please come home soon.,Lily
"So, you were an Olympic gymnast?",Barney
Silver medal.,Woman
"Ooh, sorry. Gold's the only thing that really counts.",Barney
That's what my dad said.,Woman
"And she sticks the landing. Why don't you start stretching, and I'll... be right back. Hey, hey, sorry.",Barney
"Oh, hi.",Nora
Quick question.,Barney
Yeah.,Nora
Why aren't you wearing purple like your friends?,Barney
"Oh, I told them I forgot, but the truth is, I'm kind of protesting their protest. Can you keep a secret?",Nora
Sure.,Barney
I love Valentine's Day.,Nora
"Oh, my gosh! Me, too! Um, is it getting crowded in here, 'cause I think there are two peas in this pod?",Barney
"Oh, you're a gooey romantic, too?",Nora
"Guilty. This is embarrassing but every year, I buy flowers and a box of chocolates, even if I'm not with someone. Just in case, you know?",Barney
We are pitiful.,Nora
The worst.,Barney
Although there is one difference between you and me.,Nora
What's that?,Barney
I'm not saying any of this to get in your pants.,Nora
"I miss my dad, Ted. I miss him so much.",Marshall
I know.,Ted
"Um, when I was a kid, we would spend the summers in the Upper Peninsula. And every year, we wouldn't get to the cabin till, like, the middle of the night. And so, it would be pitch black, in the middle of the woods. And I could never see anything in front of the headlights but I always felt so safe 'cause my dad was driving. He was like some sort of superhero who could just see way out into the darkness. Now he's just gone. And it's pitch black. And I can't see where I'm going. I can't see anything.",Marshall
"All right, okay. I was playing you before. But I was really doing you a public service. It's February 13... a day many are now calling Desperation Day. It's kind of a thing. And you walking around, saying you're a gooey romantic? It comes across a bit desperate.",Barney
"What's desperate about knowing what you want? Look, life is really short, Barney. Who wants to spend Valentine's Day alone, distracting yourself from the fact that nobody loves you with some sad little activity?",Nora
"Um, or you could be in the 47th Semi-Annual Laser Tag Tournament in Poughkeepsie.",Barney
I have no idea what any of those words mean.,Nora
"Hey, I'm all stretched out!",Woman
Here's the first thing you need to know about laser tag.,Barney
"Thanks a lot for coming out here, man.",Marshall
Yeah.,Ted
"Hey, are-are you sure it's okay with Zoey that you're here for Valentine's Day?",Marshall
"Well, I mean, technically, she doesn't know yet.",Ted
What?,Marshall
"Things with Zoey are moving really fast, and the divorce just makes everything more complicated. I just, I needed to take a step back.",Ted
"You're not taking a step back. You're running away. And hiding out here, hiding out here is not gonna solve anything. You're just holed up in Minnesota because you're too scared to face reality, and it's... We got to go back to New York, tonight.",Marshall
We're snowed in. Lily got the last flight.,Ted
"So, we drive. It's time. It's time to get back to real life. It's time to grow up. Yeah Mom! Can you make us some PB and J's for the road?",Marshall
Crusts cut off.,Ted
"Crusts cut off! No, Ted. What are we...? We're men. Mom! Leave the crusts on! They forced their opponents to scatter, picking them off, one by one, in a swift and merciless slaughter.",Marshall
...became the 2010 Tri-County Champions.,Barney
Wow. Laser tag sounds brilliant!,Nora
"Oh, it is. Plus, if you win, you get free pizza. This is my teammate for tomorrow.",Barney
"Oh, yeah, I agreed to that.",Robin
Where are Bev and Anna?,Nora
Well...,Robin
"So, we're taking off.",Bev
What?,Robin
Those guys are gonna buy us hot dogs at Grey's Papaya.,Anna
"What...? So that's it? A couple of white Urkels offer you sausages, and you're gone? What about the sisterhood? Solidarity? The color purple?",Robin
But tomorrow's Valentine's Day.,Bev
I thought we didn't care about Valentine's Day.,Robin
"Look, Robin, you'll find someone, too. You're a queen. You've got so much to offer. Maybe do something with that hair.",Anna
"I'm telling you. The power of Valentine's Day. I'm Huey Lewis, and you just heard the news.",Barney
"Well, I think I'm heading out, too.",Nora
"What? No, don't go! You want to see a magic trick?!",Barney
"It's late, and I have a date with my pillow. I mean, not literally. I'm not a lunatic. Boy Scout Troop 15 doesn't stand a chance. Bye.",Nora
Speaking of the power of Valentine's Day...,Robin
What are you talking about?,Barney
"Oh, come on. It's-It's past midnight. Desperation Day has come and gone, and you have neither gone nor come. You know why? You like Nora.",Robin
"No, I don't. She's gross.",Barney
Oh... You like her. You think she smells like rain.,Robin
Whatever you say.,Barney
"Oh, hey, Nora.",Robin
Nora...,Barney
"Here's a secret. I couldn't see worth a damn, either, buddy. I just kept driving forward, hoping for the best. Look out! Gotcha.",Marvin
Really? An overnight bag for your own living room? Looks like we got a matching set.,Zoey
"Well, that was kind of presumptuous.",Ted
"The ground was shaking like. Robin, where are you? Those Boy Scouts have grown a foot since last year. They're terrifying!",Barney
"Oh, yeah. Change of plans. Happy Valentine's Day.",Robin
Hap...?,Barney
"Hey, Barney. Robin told me to meet you guys here.",Nora
Oh!,Barney
You will be avenged.,Nora
"Baby, you're back.",Lily
"Happy Valentine's Day, Lily Pad. Oh.",Marshall
We both knew this would end eventually.,Lily
"Yes, I realize it's raining, but, come on, it's 2021. We can make cell phones that project holograms, but a light drizzle shuts down a whole airport?",Ted
"Hey, Ted.",Wendy
Hey... There she is. Wow.,Ted
Wendy the Waitress.,Wendy
Wendy the Waitress! I was just saying-- what are you doing here?,Ted
"So, Barney, I hear you and Nora had a fun time at laser tag.",Robin
I don't know where you heard that. It was a disaster.,Barney
Not according to her.,Robin
"Oh, my God, this was so much fun. We have to do this again. We do, we have to.",Nora
You want to grab a drink right now?,Barney
"No, I'm kind of tired. But... this is my number. Give me a call.",Nora
Absolutely.,Barney
How is that a disaster?,Robin
"She didn't want to get drinks. And as soon as a girl says she doesn't want to get drinks, well...",Barney
You want to grab a drink right now?,Barney
"No, I'm kind of tired.",Nora
Absolutely.,Barney
"It's a shame, too. She was a really great laser tag partner. She's tiny, so she's allowed to push kids.",Barney
"Please, Cheese. You like this girl.",Robin
"What? Nora? No, I don't.",Barney
"Barney, you can't say her name without smiling.",Robin
"That's... Nora. Sorry, sorry. I was thinking of a funny thing that Nora said. Hmm. Stop it. No... ra. Nah... Damn it, what is the matter with me?",Barney
You like her. You should call her.,Robin
"Call her? she had a nice face, her booty was in place, but Barney don't chase.",Barney
"That is ridiculous. Barney, you know what, here's some advice.",Robin
Totally.,Barney
"Oh, Ted, she doesn't want...",Woman
"No, it's a cute story. Once upon a time...",Ted
"Zoey was married to this super rich, super creepy guy called The Captain. So when Zoey and I became friends, I was careful not to cross any lines.",Ted
"Oh, man, this movie is scary.",Zoey
"I know, right? But then one day, Zoey and The Captain had a huge fight. He flipped out and demanded a divorce. And she was heartbroken. But after a little soul-searching, she ended up back in my and the rest, as they say, is history.",Ted
"Actually, I said, How's your meat?",Woman
Oh. A little cold.,Ted
"Gee, wonder why.",Woman
"Oh, Ted, did you have a chance to pick up that box I left at my old apartment?",Zoey
"Oh. Yeah, I don't want to see The Captain. I mean this in a super manly way. That guy scares the panties off me.",Ted
You don't have to see him. He left the box with the doorman.,Zoey
"If it's really important to you, I will pick it up tomorrow.",Ted
"All right, guys, I have to go. I have a big meaningless stack of paperwork that I have to get off my desk to make room for tomorrow's big meaningless stack of paperwork. But it's all worth it, you know, 'cause at least I know I'm making the world a... place. All right, see you guys later.",Marshall
I'm worried about Marshall. He doesn't seem like himself lately.,Ted
"Yeah, he's been really... quiet.",Lily
"Well, that's just what Minnesota guys are like... strong, silent, you know, man's man.",Robin
Like Prince.,Barney
"No, it's more than that. It's like, all the stuff he used to love, he suddenly has no interest in anymore.",Lily
Oh. Ha-wink,Barney
Excuse me?,Lily
"Lily, in my travels, I've developed a finely calibrated sense of how long it's been since... How do I not put this delicately?... a girl's been porked. And, boo, you've been pork-free so long, you're practically kosher.",Barney
It's been a while.,Lily
"Five weeks, three days by my estimation.",Barney
You should work at a carnival.,Lily
I tried. They're pretty strict with backgrounds.,Barney
"Anyway, we should get going.",Ted
"Yeah, I'll walk out with you guys.",Lily
"Good night. Good night, guys.",Robin
18 weeks.,Barney
"Damn it. Okay, yes, I am in a bit of a dry spell. But I just started a new job, and dating's been on the back burner, and...",Robin
"Shh. Child, listen. If you're really hurting for it, I'd be more than happy to throw you one.",Barney
Throw me one? Yeah.,Robin
We're exes. We're probably due for a backslide. Or we could just do it the normal way.,Barney
"Oh, I see what's going on.",Robin
Yeah?,Barney
"This is about Nora. You met a girl, you liked her, but then you missed your sh*t. And now you're trying to hook up with your ex-girlfriend to prove to yourself that you don't care.",Robin
"Robin, you could not be more... What do you mean I missed my sh*t?",Barney
Nora met a guy. What?!,Robin
What?,Barney
Yep. Off the market. He's taking her to Cafe L'Amour this Friday night.,Robin
"But L'Amour means love! They're going to the cafe of love! I'm fine. It's fine. Point is, Robin, I don't even like Nora. Damn it!",Barney
"Oh, baby, why aren't you in bed?",Lily
I can't sleep.,Marshall
Mmm. Anything I can do to help you with that?,Lily
Maybe after this documentary on garbage.,Marshall
"Man, I am losing my touch.",Lily
"Nearly twice the size of Texas, the Gweat Pacific Garbage Patch, or Garbage Island, is an enviwonmental disaster. Sepawated from its pawents, this young bird stwuggles to survive, stwangling itself in the plastic wings of a six-pack. Marshall Eriksen, I think you know what you have to do.",Tv
I have to save the planet!,Marshall
Is it over? I call on top.,Lily
I'm here to...,Ted
Ted. What a surprise. Ted.,Captain
Captain. I...,Ted
You've come to rescue me from the capsized wreckage of my marriage. Mm... I hesitated calling you because I know you and Zoey were friendly.,Captain
"Pssh, nah...",Ted
"But my wife has left me. All my friends have abandoned me. Please, tell me you're on my side. Let's adjourn to the study.",Captain
Garbage Island. You haven't heard of Garbage Island? It's an island... made of garbage! It's in the Pacific Ocean. It's twice the size of Texas!,Marshall
"In other words, one-eighth the size of Canada. So...",Robin
"Guys, I'm going environmental, okay? Phase one: the bar. I've already convinced MacLaren's to implement a new green initiative.",Marshall
That's 'cause of you? I got to carry an 80-pound bag of bottles to the recycling center every night. I threw my back out.,Wendy
You're welcome... Earth. Phase two: GNB. Tomorrow I'm going to make a presentation in front of the board about how we can cut our carbon footprint by half for only $12 million.,Marshall
"Dude, don't do that. All they're going to hear is $12 million, and all you're going to hear is the sound of the door smacking your fired ass. And some muffled laughter. Which I apologize for in advance.",Barney
"Guys, I got a problem. I ran into The Captain.",Ted
"Ted, beneath this lustrous mane,I wear the horns of a cuckold. Zoey left me for another man.",Captain
Wow.,Ted
Do you have any idea who it could be?,Captain
"Once upon a time, Zoey and I were happy. Blissful as Arcadian shepherds. I was Poseidon, she my Amphitrite. I dare say, Scylla and Charybdis could not have torn us asunder. We had great big boners for each other. But then... enter the scoundrel. I don't know what he looks like, but I picture him with a mustache.",Captain
Yes! Limit the search to guys with mustaches. Smart.,Ted
"Anyway, soon the inevitable happened. She told me she was in love with someone else. Obviously, it made me angry.",Captain
And that's the last time you saw her.,Ted
"But I gathered my composure, and told her I'd do anything to keep her. I begged her not to leave. We made love that night.",Captain
That's damn good brandy.,Ted
"But morning came, and she was gone.",Captain
"Oh, Captain... don't blame yourself.",Ted
I don't blame myself. Hmm? There's only one man I blame for this.,Captain
Me. I'm the bad guy.,Ted
"Well, maybe to him you are, but in the story of picking up the box for Zoey, you're the hero.",Robin
Damn it! The box!,Ted
"Baby, baby, I really got to work on this presentation.",Marshall
"Oh, that's too bad, 'cause I was going to make a little presentation of my own.",Lily
"Okay, why not: from now until tomorrow afternoon, I do this, and then tomorrow night, I do that.",Marshall
"Deal. Come on, come on.",Lily
Lily!,Marshall
"You lying little minx. I happened to be at Cafe L'Amour tonight from 5:00 p.m. until closing, reading a newspaper with two holes cut out of it, and I never saw Nora or this Italian race car driver she's dating.",Barney
Sorry. Who said anything about an...?,Robin
"Come on, you just know he's an Italian race car driver.",Barney
"No, he's not. He doesn't exist. I made the whole thing up to see if you like her. And you do. So you should just call her. Here is her number. And I also programmed it into your phone while you were in the bathroom. Wow. That was a joke. You just got here, remember? You really are smitten.",Robin
"No, I'm not. I'm Barney Stinson. I don't get smitten, I smite!",Barney
"You are totally smitten, but you're scared of being in a relationship.",Robin
"No, I'm not. I can't be anyone's boyfriend, Robin. If I got serious with Nora, it would be like if Mother Teresa focused all her attention on one really hot orphan. With great penis comes great responsibility.",Barney
"Okay, Mother Teresa, throw me one.",Robin
Sorry?,Barney
"I would like it if you threw me one. Fastball, right down the middle. Actually, if I recall correctly, a slight curve.",Robin
"Careful, Robin, I'll do it.",Barney
"Oh, I don't think you will. Hmm. Because you don't want to screw things up with Nora. Hey, prove me wrong. Tomorrow night, my place.",Robin
"Don't poke the dragon, Robin, 'cause the dragon will poke you back.",Barney
"Sex now, we'll do the foreplay after.",Lily
"Oh, no, baby, come on. Today didn't go so well.",Marshall
"The green initiative, for only $12 million, will change the way...",Marshall
"Okay, I've heard enough. Don't we already have a green initiative? I mean, didn't we do a whole thing? Hang a banner, make a video, Sting was there. I thought I met Sting.",Arthur
You did meet Sting.,Man
"Yeah, I met Sting. So why on Earth would we spend another $12 million?",Arthur
"Well, because we can always do more.",Marshall
"Yeah, but I met Sting.",Arthur
"Well, meeting Sting isn't gonna fix anything, Arthur!",Marshall
Who here supports Eriksen's proposal?,Arthur
"Well, he has some good points.",Meeker
"Meeker, you're fired! And as for you, Eriksen...",Arthur
His father just died.,Man
...nice presentation. We'll keep it under advisement.,Arthur
Meeker got fired because of me. I'm the bad guy.,Marshall
"No, sweetie, just-just put all that out of your mind and relax. Look, I got you a six-pack of tall boys from the deli.",Lily
"Hey, baby.",Marshall
Yeah?,Lily
What happened to the plastic rings that held the six-pack together?,Marshall
"Oh, I-I don't know. I threw them down the garbage chute. Let's just use the handcuffs instead.",Lily
"Baby, birds can get caught in those and then they dwown in a sea of wubbish! Weren't you listening? Don't you care about Garbage Island?",Marshall
"Marshall, right now, I don't give a wat's ass about Garbage Island.",Lily
"Well, I do. I got to find those rings!",Marshall
Cwap.,Lily
"Hi, I'm here to pick up...",Ted
"Hello, Ted.",Captain
To the study?,Ted
To the study! Mmm. Ted... I know.,Captain
Know what?,Ted
"I know who stole my Zoey. No man likes to be betrayed, especially by a friend. You can imagine then how painful it was when I learned that the name of my betrayer is... Ted... when I tell you who it is, you're gonna... It's my doorman!",Captain
That son of a bitch! You think Zoey's sleeping with the doorman?,Ted
"He always winks and tips his hat when he sees her. I know how these things work. He holds her package, and pretty soon, she's holding his. And then there's his glorious mustache. I will have him fired for this!",Captain
"No, no, no, you can't fire him.",Ted
You're right. Maritime protocol demands physical retribution!,Captain
"Oh, my God! No, no! No physical retribution! Stop!",Ted
"Who is this flower child, and what has he done with my lionhearted friend Ted Mosby?!",Captain
"Look, look, yes, yes, the doorman is a scoundrel. The mustache alone gives that away. He's a rake, a rogue, a rapscallion!",Ted
"Whoa, rapscallion may be going a bit far, Ted.",Captain
"But it's not his fault, okay? It's nobody's fault. You and Zoey have nothing in common. For God's sake, Captain, she hates boats! You're just not right for each other. Look, I know it's tough to face, but I'm sure a small part of you has always known that.",Ted
"Why couldn't she just like boats? Just to have one thing in common? Other girls like boats, don't they?",Captain
Of course they do. And you'll find one. And you'll be much happier with her than you ever were with Zoey.,Ted
"When you put it that way, I should almost thank the doorman.",Captain
"Yeah, yeah! And, you know, since, since it doesn't really matter who Zoey's dating now...",Ted
"It doesn't, it really doesn't. It doesn't.",Captain
It's me. You're welcome.,Ted
"Okay, baby, what gives?",Lily
"I'm sorry, but neither of us are getting any action until I find those rings.",Marshall
I hope this doesn't make me look desperate.,Lily
"All right, Robin, give it to me.",Barney
"Damn it, Barney, you failed my test! You know, I- I try to root for you. Even as your ex-girlfriend, when you meet someone, I'm like, Yeah, Barney, go get her! But you know what? Just forget it. You're never gonna change. I'm done trying to help you.",Robin
"The number. Give me the number, 'cause I really can't tell... Is that a seven or a nine?",Barney
"It's a five, idiot.",Robin
A fi...? In what moon man language is that a five?,Barney
Moon man language? What does that even mean?,Robin
How am I supposed to see that's a five?,Barney
Look how you taped this up...,Robin
"Fine, fine, fine. I have a phone call to make.",Barney
Barney. Go get her.,Robin
"Listen, Zoey, I need to ask you something. Did I steal you?",Ted
"Well... yeah. You did. By being the kind of sweet, thoughtful guy who'd never even think of stealing someone, you stole me.",Zoey
So I'm the bad guy. Great.,Ted
"Well, the story isn't over, Ted. It'll be years before we know who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. I mean, yes, divorce sucks, but sometimes things need to fall apart to make way for better things.",Zoey
If you say so.,Ted
"I'm just saying, the eggs are already broken. Let's make sure we get a pretty good omelet out of it.",Zoey
"Okay, Marshall, seriously, what's going on?",Lily
He'll never get to see how I turn out.,Marshall
What do you mean?,Lily
"My dad. You know, I used to, um, I used to always tell him that I was gonna be an environmental lawyer. And he was always so proud of me for that. But he never got to see the version of me that was anything but a corporate stooge. And now it's too late. And we're starting a family, you know.",Marshall
Are you avoiding sleeping with me 'cause you don't want to start a family?,Lily
"Lily, if we have a baby right now, that is just it for me. The cement will dry, and I will be stuck at GNB forever.",Marshall
"Marshall, if you want to quit your job and go work for the NRDC right now, then you need to do that right now. And then, once you've cleaned up all the oceans and saved the planet... you know, like, a year from now... then we'll start a family.",Lily
"I don't know. So far, in the name of saving the planet, I've ruined your night, I practically broke Wendy's back and I got Meeker fired. The guy must hate me.",Marshall
Meeker doesn't hate you.,Lily
Are you guys...?,Meeker
Closed. Sorry. Thanks.,Wendy
Rough night?,Meeker
Yeah.,Wendy
I'm sorry.,Meeker
It's not your fault. It's no one's fault. Except for Marshall Eriksen.,Wendy
What did you just say?,Meeker
"Uh, I said it's Marshall Eriksen's fault. Why, do you know him?",Wendy
Know him? I hate that guy.,Meeker
"Me, too.",Wendy
"Well, hey.",Meeker
"And three kids later, we decided to come here on our second honeymoon.",Wendy
Wow. That's a pretty good omelet.,Ted
"Oh, and hey, what about you? You still with Zoey?",Wendy
"No, no, no. Wow, that did not end well. But it's all for the best, 'cause now I'm married to an amazing girl, we have two kids. It's actually a funny story of how we met. I was a best man at this wedding...",Ted
"Listen, Ted, it's great seeing you, but we got to run.",Wendy
"Okay, well, have a safe trip. It was great seeing you. ",Ted
"Hey, Ted.",Marshall
Hey. You will not believe who I just ran into.,Ted
"I don't need to go to a heart doctor. I drink every day, I sleep three hours every night, and I have multiple sex partners. I'm doing everything right.",Barney
"Barney, come on, this is important. We need you around for a long time. Without you, we'd have to find some other sex-fueled, depraved animal to entertain us.",Ted
"Actually, I'm thinking about getting a dog again.",Robin
"Oh, can she? Can she get a dog, please Dad?",Lily
"No. If you get a dog, I'm going to be the one stuck taking care of it.",Ted
You wouldn't have to take care of it.,Robin
Really? And who watered the philodendron on your bookcase and sang it back to life?,Ted
"Yeah, that was made out of silk, Ted.",Robin
"Okay, Robin, what you need is indeed something that buries a bone, but I'm not talking about a dog. I'm talking about a man.",Marshall
Here we go.,Robin
"You're clearly trying to fill a hole... in her heart. You feel like the seventh wheel, because now Ted is with Zoey and Barney's with Nora and Lily's with Big Fudge.",Marshall
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Big Fudge. With? I am not with Nora. Wrong preposition. Later tonight I'm hoping to be on Nora, right? Or under Nora, right? Or, we're all adults, I'll just say it... behind Nora.",Barney
I don't know. This will be your second date.,Robin
"Oh, Barney's got feeling for a girl.",Lily
"Yeah. Penis feelings. Because she's hot. Guys, as you know, I only have one rule...",Barney
"If you're gonna get it on in a Port-O-Potty, do it early in the day  Never screw over a girl whose last name ends in a vowel. 'Cause she's got brothers  Never date a girl with a hook for a hand ",Barney
Never go out with the same girl more than once.,Barney
Then why are you going out with Nora again?,Lily
There is an exception.,Barney
...unless she's hot ...unless she's hot ...unless she's hot.,Barney
"And she is indeed hot. Which is why nothing, not even God himself... yeah, I said it, Beardy... is going to stand in the way of tonight being legend... Wait for it. ",Barney
"Hey, Nora, sorry I'm late. I'm just, uh, just getting over a cold.",Barney
"Oh, no. How long have you been sick?",Nora
About 20 minutes. Can't seem to shake it.,Barney
"Okay, 'cause I was going to say you look a little...",Nora
Handsome? Rich? Well-endowed?,Barney
"Huh, let's say well-endowed... with phlegm. All right, let's go. It's bedtime.",Nora
The bed... that's where all the...happens.,Barney
"Come on, let's get you sorted out.",Nora
Ah. Thank you.,Barney
"Good night, Barney.",Nora
"Good night, Mommy.",Barney
"Wow, she nursed you back to health?",Lily
No. I didn't even see her boobs. She just took care of me.,Barney
"Oh, hey, guys. This is Nate. Nate, these are my friends.",Robin
"What's up. guys? Nate Scooberman. But everyone calls me Scooby. I'd love to hang out, but I really gotta hit the john.",Nate
"Uh, yeah, it's right in here... Scooby.",Ted
"Thanks, brah. I like you guys.",Nate
"Oh, Robin, if you weren't so much stronger than me, I would slap you.",Marshall
What? You told me to meet someone.,Robin
"I know, and, look, he seems plenty nice, but I didn't mean bring home the first guy you bump into on the street.",Marshall
"Actually, I met him in the park.",Robin
Should have just let you get a dog.,Ted
"Oh, oh, I should go. Lily, can I talk to you for a second? So, um, I made an appointment with that cardiologist.",Barney
"Aw, and you want me to go with you 'cause you're a little scared?",Lily
No.,Barney
Do you want me to go with you because you're a lot scared?,Lily
Yes!,Barney
"Okay, fine. On one condition. You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora. She seems like something special.",Lily
"Okay, I promise I won't lie to her. I may, however, lie on her. I said, bang-bang, bangity-bang.* Bang-bang-bang, bangity-bang *",Barney
"* Bang, bang, bangity bang... *",Barney
"* A bang-bang, bangity-bang. *",Barney
"See, Lily? She was worried.",Barney
"Ow! Nails, nails!",Lily
"Twen... Flag on the play, Doc. I have a date tonight.",Barney
"Well, now it doesn't.",Barney
"Go on, Doctor.",Barney
"Well, let's see... uh, Wheel of Fortune, naked push-ups, naked chin-ups... I was at dinner.",Barney
"This might be a little forward, but do you have a b*mb strapped to your chest?",Nora
"This? No, no. It's a heart monitor. It's a medical thing.",Barney
"Oh, I'm so sorry. I've been trying not to stare at your chest all night.",Nora
What's that like?,Barney
So is everything okay?,Nora
"My friend's dad passed away from a sudden heart attack. So I'm just getting myself checked out, too.",Barney
"Oh, I am so sorry.",Nora
Thanks.,Barney
"Um, Barney, what I'm about to say is going to sound a little weird, but I think I'm starting to like you, so I have to say it.",Nora
"Well, for what it's worth, I'm not easily shocked. Unless you dump water on me, 'cause I'll just... No. What is it?",Barney
"I want to get married. I mean, not tonight, or even to you, necessarily. But that's what I want. And if that's going to scare you off, then I'd rather it scare you off now. I want a family, and I want to live in a little house with a garden and a tree for the kids to climb. And I want to go to sleep every night with the same person by my side, and wake up next to him in the morning every morning for the rest of our lives. Just thought you should know that.",Nora
You have to promise me you won't lie to Nora!,Lily
"That's exactly what I want, too.",Barney
"I'm really into gardening, but these squirrels keep messing with my tomatoes. Every time I see them in the backyard, I'm like, get out of here! And they run off, but sure enough, a few minutes later, there they are again. And I'm like, get out of here! So annoying. I smell food. Does this place have a kitchen? I'll be right back.",Nate
"Okay, but you have to admit that he is a lot of fun.",Robin
"Oh, I actually think he's quite intelligent for what he is.",Marshall
And what is he?,Robin
He's a dog.,Marshall
He's totally a dog.,Ted
What? You saw him hitting on someone?,Robin
"No, I didn't say, He a dawg. I said, He's a dog. As in, a dog. I think we've all noticed a few curious mannerisms. Or rather, doggerisms.",Marshall
"Uh, Scooby, the tag's still on your jeans.",Ted
Where?,Nate
"Okay, Scooby, you ready?",Marshall
Good boy!,Ted
That last one did not happen.,Robin
"Okay, you're right. He dropped it.",Marshall
He's not a dog.,Robin
"Robin, it's fine. You said you wanted a dog and you got one. And the best part is, he got his shots.",Ted
"Hey, guys, got my shots.",Nate
You are so playful.,Marshall
Nice job fetching those.,Ted
"Yeah, guys, cut it out. Scooby, sit.",Lily
"So, Scooby, we were thinking if you're going to be hanging out with our Robin, you should be properly vetted.",Marshall
"Uh, yeah. We hope our nosiness doesn't give you paws.",Ted
How did you meet?,Lily
Tell us the tail,Marshall
"Yes, how did you whisker off her feet? Shed a little light on the matter.",Ted
"Did you send her an e-mail, or did you collar?",Lily
"Guys, just stop hounding him. Oh, geez.",Robin
"No, no, you're right, Robin. We don't want your new guy to flea.",Marshall
We're just trying to make sure he's not a heel.,Lily
"So, moving from Canada, that transition must have been pretty ruff.",Ted
Sure was. My part of Canada's pretty different from New York.,Nate
"Oh, I bet it was an Incredible Journey",Lily
What part of Canada is that? Speak.,Marshall
Labrador.,Nate
This isn't happening.,Lily
"Hey, Nate, why don't you go play some music on the jukebox.",Robin
"No, I'm good.",Nate
"Oh, sh**t, dropped my keys.",Robin
I'll get 'em.,Nate
"Hey, guys, this is Nora.",Barney
"We were just passing by, and I wanted to pop in for two reasons. First, I wanted to let you know that your friend Barney is being a perfect gentleman.",Nora
"Well, it's still early.",Robin
"I'm being serious. I had no idea that deep down, he's such a romantic.",Nora
I had no idea he had a deep down.,Lily
"Oh, you should have heard him at dinner.",Nora
"I mean, I like being single, but secretly, I want to have kids.",Barney
How many do you want?,Nora
Three... one of each. You?,Barney
Three. All in an old stone house.,Nora
"Yeah, with ivy growing on it.",Barney
And we must have a pool.,Barney
"We? A pool sounds brilliant. Are you for real, Barney?",Nora
I really am.,Barney
Unbelievable.,Robin
"I know, right? And the second reason we popped in is 'cause I need to use the loo. But when I get back, I'm dying to hear all about Mr. Softy here.",Nora
"I assure you, that's not a nickname that I...",Barney
"Barney, you promised you wouldn't lie.",Lily
"I'm not lying! Guys, Nora's really special. In fact... I think I'm... falling in love with her. Guys! I'm serious.",Barney
"I'm not going to let you do this. When Nora gets back here, I'm blowing the whistle.",Lily
"Just make sure it's not a high-frequency whistle, because we don't want to torture Robin's boyfriend.",Marshall
"Guys, this is real. And if you don't make me look good in front of Nora, just remember: I've got dirt on each of you, and I am not afraid to spill it.",Barney
"Barney, you can't blackmail us into lying to Nora.",Lily
"Really, Lily? Even if I were to mention, oh, I don't know... your kindergarten class's pet guinea pig?",Barney
"Mr. Buttons? Oh, you son of a bitch. Fine. I'll be nice.",Lily
Marshall?,Barney
You got nothing on me.,Marshall
The calzone?,Barney
Checkmate.,Marshall
Robin.,Barney
"Don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream, don't say the Mr. T dream...",Robin
The Mr. T dream...,Barney
I'm lost.,Robin
Ted?,Barney
Go ahead. Give me your best. My life's an open book.,Ted
The ballet class.,Barney
I once took a ballet class. Not ashamed.,Ted
The 'N Sync concert.,Barney
"1998. Cleveland's g*n Arena, front row. Caught JC's shirt. What else you got?",Ted
"Okay, Ted. The thermos.",Barney
I suppose it's possible Barney has real feelings for Nora.,Ted
I do! So be cool!,Barney
There's a man back there who seems fascinated by the records flipping in the jukebox.,Nora
"Sorry, toots. He's taken.",Robin
So. How do you all know Barney?,Nora
"Oh, I don't know how we know Barney. How does anyone know how they know anyone? I like your pretty hair, help me.",Lily
"We did not meet him at a strip club. No, sir. Because... Barney don't go to no strip clubs.",Marshall
"Oh, come on. Barney's been to a strip club once.",Nora
Once?,Ted
Thermos.,Barney
Nope. Not even once.,Ted
Really? So Barney really is a genuinely a nice guy.,Nora
I don't recall.,Lily
"Okay, I think that we're done here, I think that we have adequately established that Barney is... the kind of guy that you would bring home to meet your parents. Okay? So... let's just drop it, all right?",Marshall
"It's funny you should say that, because, as it happens, my parents are in town. They're only here like once a year. We're getting brunch tomorrow. Do you want to meet them?",Nora
"I only have one rule. Never, ever, ever meet a girl's parents.",Barney
Not even if she's hot?,Ted
Not even if her mom's hot.,Barney
I'd love to meet your parents.,Barney
"It's a date. Well, we should get going. Walk me home?",Nora
Walk? Somebody say walk? I'll go for a walk. I love a good walk.,Nate
"No, Scooby, you, uh... stay!",Barney
"Oh, no. I got called back in to work. Can you keep an eye on him until I get back? He's new to the city, and he doesn't really know anyone.",Robin
"I knew it. I knew it. I knew if you got a dog, I'd wind up taking care of it.",Ted
He's not a... Good night.,Robin
"What do we do now? Oh! I got an idea. I was in the park today, and this guy sold me a big bag of...",Nate
Whoa. Put that away.,Marshall
You guys want to fire these up?,Nate
"Scooby, we're in our 30s. We don't smoke sandwiches anymore.",Lily
Sandwich brownies?,Ted
Okay.,Nate
Sandwiches make me hungry.,Marshall
Truth. Hey. I have a question.,Ted
Yeah?,Marshall
What did Barney mean when he said calzone?,Ted
"Okay, I'll tell you. Okay. One time Barney saw me drop a calzone on the sidewalk, pick it up, and then keep eating it. It feels so good to finally say that out loud. I...",Marshall
Dude. Listen to me. You have nothing to be ashamed of. That calzone sounds amazing.,Ted
"Guys, I found this on the floor.",Lily
"Oh, my God. Scooby ate the whole tray. Wait. Where is he, anyway?",Ted
Scooby got out!,Lily
Here we are. I had a really great time tonight.,Nora
"Yeah, me, too.",Barney
Do you want to come upstairs?,Nora
I'd love to. ,Barney
Can you believe...,Barney
"Oh, my God! I found Scooby's wallet.",Lily
"Oh, no! That means the poor guy's out there with no identification.",Marshall
Got out? What do you mean?,Robin
He just walked out of the apartment. Someone must've left the door open.,Ted
It wasn't me.,Marshall
Me neither. He must've figured out how to open it himself.,Lily
He's so smart. We should get him on Letterman doing tricks.,Ted
I know Paul Schaffer's sandwich guy. This could happen.,Marshall
Guys. Get yourselves together and start looking for Scooby. I'm on my way home.,Robin
Wait wait! Robin. Can you pick up some calzones?,Ted
"Wait... Nora, wait. Wait. I'm sorry I misled you.",Barney
Misled? You lied to me! You had your friends lie to me!,Nora
I was on the spot. This is your fault.,Barney
My fault?,Nora
"Yeah, with the whole I want to get married thing. You can't just tell someone exactly what you want out of a relationship. This... isn't England.",Barney
"Good-bye, Barney.",Nora
Great idea.,Ted
"No, great idea!",Marshall
"Okay. If you were new in town and had just ingested an eighth of sandwich, where would you go?",Lily
Of course. Back to the pizza place!,Marshall
Yeah! Maybe that's where Scooby went.,Ted
Who's Scooby?,Marshall
"Hey, have you seen Scooby?",Robin
"Uh, yeah. Isn't that him taking a leak on that fire hydrant?",Barney
Scooby!,Marshall
"Oh, hey! It's my friends!",Nate
Day's not over.,Lily
"Okay. Lily, I'm sorry that I lied about wanting to settle down.",Barney
"No, that wasn't the lie. The lie was when you told Nora you were lying. Because you weren't. You want that stuff, Barney, I know you do.",Lily
"Okay. Maybe, eventually, I could settle down. 50 years from now, if I have like a Hefner thing going on with some really hot twins. But those twins won't even be born for another... 32 years. I mean... Nora's great. She's wonderful. But...",Barney
What time was your dinner reservation?,Lily
Last night? 8:30.,Barney
"Your heart's talking to you, Barney. Do you have the guts to listen to it.",Lily
I lied.,Barney
Barney.,Nora
"When I said I lied, that was a lie, and I'm sorry.",Barney
I'm confused.,Nora
"So am I. This, all of this, this is totally new to me, but I know it's what I want. I want to be confused. With you.",Barney
"Mom, Dad... this is Barney.",Nora
"Hi. I'm Barney. Great to meet you. Hey, you want to see a magic trick?",Barney
"Vintage rolltop desk here. I haven't decided whether to put the fern on the right or the left side, but you know, sometimes you just gotta wing it. Right? Left side. Oh, and right outside, I want to put up a basketball hoop for the kids.",Ted
"Ted. This is your seduction lounge. Sex swing there, vibrating Jell-O pit right there, rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel right here. Don't ask; you're not ready. And that basketball hoop? Outdoor stripper pole. We'll just tell the ladies to be careful in the winter. You think a tongue stuck to a frozen pole is bad...",Barney
"Hey. Barney, let's go outside for a second.",Marshall
We have a confession. This wasn't really about seeing Ted's house. It's an intervention.,Lily
"Oh, thank God. I'll go first. Ted, this hous you bought for your hypothetical family is super weird. We talk about it all the time behind your back.",Barney
Yeah. This intervention isn't for me. It's for you,Ted
"Barney, I can't believe your giant TV is broken. It's March Madness.",Marshall
"Okay, uh, I think I see what the problem is. Barney, can you grab me a screwdriver?",Ted
"Sure thing. Luis. Barney Stinson, 12 H. I got a hundred bucks if you can be here in five. Thanks.",Barney
You call the super for a screwdriver?,Lily
"Yeah... here's the thing about me and tools... the only one I know how to use is attached to me, and I am not going to try putting it in the TV. Again.",Barney
"Okay, that's ridiculous. Everyone should know how to use tools.",Ted
"Well, here's our screwdriver now. (",Barney
"Barney, I... I got your letter.",Jerry
Dad?,Barney
I can't believe Barney is talking to his dad right now.,Marshall
"Yeah, what do you say after three decades of not seeing each other?",Robin
"So, how 'bout those last 30 Super Bowls?",Lily
"Okay, now I feel bad about making fun of him for the tool thing. My dad was the one who taught me all that stuff.",Ted
"Well, to be fair, everyone has some glaring gap in knowledge, something really obvious you somehow never learned.",Robin
"Okay, but a screwdriver? Come on, I don't have any gaps that fundamental.",Ted
Really? I seem to recall...,Robin
Daniel Burnham was an architect whose ever-shifting style and aesthetic made him a true architectural chamma-leeon. And only the most gifted chamma-leeon could've designed classic beaux arts masterpieces right alongside sleek modern flatirons. His name might as well have been Daniel Chamma-leeon.,Ted
"Um, Professor? Uh, do you mean chameleon?",Student
"Betty, I'm pretty sure it's pronounced chamma-leeon, so... Class dismissed. No homework. For a while.",Ted
"Okay, I learned that word by reading it. That's how I've always pronounced it.",Ted
"Ted, that wasn't easy. It took a lot of ch-aracter to admit that.",Robin
"Okay, Scherbatsky. You want to tussle? I'll tussle.",Ted
You want to tussle? Let's tussle.,Robin
Marine biologist.,Ted
"Please, no.",Robin
"So this really sucks, but I'm going to be in the North Pole for the next three months.",Scott
"Seriously? The North Pole? Okay, pal, if you want to break up with me, just tell it to me straight. Don't pretend you're going someplace we all know doesn't exist.",Robin
"Um, I'm going to be studying the mating habits of...",Scott
"Of who? Santa's elves? Rudolph? You know what? I'm going on a trip, too, Scott. It, uh, starts in Narnia. It works its way up to Candyland, and then, hey, congratulate me, because I'm the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. Expelliarmus!",Robin
"Robin, the North Pole is a real place. You know that, right?",Scott
So... you want to get pizza later? Or...,Robin
I think we should break up.,Scott
I still think about him in the shower.,Robin
"Hey. Tell us everything. How'd it go, bud?",Ted
Where do I begin?,Barney
Yeah. I think I need a drink.,Barney
"Me, too.",Jerry
"Glen McKenna, neat.",Both
Nice order. Up top.,Jerry
"Look, it's been 30 years. And now you just show up out of nowhere? This is... this is going to take me a minute.",Barney
"Yeah. I understand. By the way, hell of a tie. Is that Italian silk?",Jerry
"I love you, Daddy. I'm so glad we're best friends now.",Barney
Make a muscle.,Barney
There you go.,Jerry
Ah!,Barney
"Guys, my dad's awesome. He's the mother of all fathers. Check this out.",Barney
"Hey, back when I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. Do you still do that?",Barney
"Not anymore. Back in '83 I'm lugging amps for The Stones through West Germany, and their tour manager loses his arms, bus-surfing through a tunnel. Gnarly. Long story short, I've been managing tours ever since, and that dude high-fives people with his face now.",Jerry
"So, all these years, there's this one question I've been dying to ask him.",Barney
Why did you abandon me?,Lily
Why'd you wait so long to contact me?,Marshall
"You've hurt me before, why should I trust you now?",Robin
Do you... get laid a lot?,Barney
Big-time. Observe.,Jerry
"Oh, my God, that took you five seconds.",Barney
"Oh, was it that long? Life's too short for chatty chicks.",Jerry
You're a master. You are legen... wait for it...,Barney
"...daddy! Legendaddy! The man is a god. And he's still out there, living the dream.",Barney
So I'm going to Sydney tomorrow with Bon Jovi. I'll be on the road the rest of the year.,Jerry
"Oh, that's cool.",Barney
"Say, you want to join me for the tour's Asian leg?",Jerry
This is going to be the second-most fun I've ever had on an Asian leg. ,Barney
"Barney, we... we know you're psyched, but just... be careful.",Lily
What do you mean?,Barney
"Well, this guy has flaked out on your whole life. It sounds like he just might be telling you what you want to hear.",Ted
"Barney, we just don't want to see you get hurt.",Robin
"First of all, Robin, my dad could b*at up your dad. Second, you don't have to worry. He's cool. Now if you'll excuse me... I have to go renew my passport, and get a travel-sized rotating Vietnamese Shame Wheel. Don't ask; you're not ready.",Barney
"I hope Barney's dad isn't just pretending to be something he's not, you know?",Ted
Yeah. That would make Jerry a real chamma-leeon.,Lily
"You have gaps, too, Lily.",Ted
You got nothing on me.,Lily
"Hey, Lily, can you toss me a beer?",Marshall
"Sure, honey. ",Lily
You have terrible aim.,Ted
That's not true.,Lily
"Lily, at our apartment, you're the one who pees on the floor.",Marshall
"Oh, my God. Barney's dad.",Robin
"Hey, uh, you're Barney's friends, right?",Jerry
"Yeah, but... aren't you supposed to be off managing some tour in Australia?",Marshall
"What? No, I... I'm a driving instructor up in White Plains. And I need your help... Barney won't return my calls.",Jerry
"What do you mean, Barney won't return your calls? He said you two had an amazing night together.",Lily
That's not what happened.,Jerry
I'm not sure how to start this.,Barney
Yeah.,Jerry
I think I need a drink.,Barney
"Me, too.",Jerry
"Glen McKenna, neat.",Barney
"Milk, skim.",Jerry
"Milk? Oh, you're taking it easy. Crazy night?",Barney
"I'll say. Between you and me, I had a lot of acid last night.",Jerry
Wow.,Barney
"I think it was the chili dog. I had to take four Tums. I was up till, like, 9:30.",Jerry
"Hey, um.. When I was a kid, you used to be a roadie. You still do that?",Barney
"No. I switched lanes years ago. I should explain. I'm a driving instructor. Now you get it, right",Jerry
"Yeah, no, I get it. Um, but when I was a kid, you... you were this total badass.",Barney
"Oh, I know. I was a real hard partier.",Jerry
"Yeah, okay, now we're getting to the good stuff.",Barney
"The drugs, the alcohol, the women...",Jerry
"Yes, yes, yes.",Barney
I was out of control.,Jerry
*Out of control.*,Barney
"So when your mom said I couldn't see you any more, it was rock bottom for me. I'm so sorry.",Jerry
You ever bang Stevie Nicks?,Barney
Barney wasn't interested in my apology. He just wanted me to be cool. And I was so desperate to connect with him. I did something I'm not proud of. I started bragging.,Jerry
"I bet you didn't know this about me, Barney, but I've published two nonfiction books about asparagus. And one fiction. I'm credited with inventing the word furgling. It means fumbling for keys. So then all the county fair judges started chanting, More quiche! More quiche! I guess you could call me the LeBron James of drapes.",Jerry
"I could tell he just wanted me to be this big ladies' man, so...",Jerry
"What a hottie, huh? I'm sure you're a real player.",Jerry
Big-time.,Barney
"Observe. Excuse me, that's my son over there. I'm trying to reconnect with him after 30 years. Would you just write down any seven numbers here, so that I can impress him? Please, I'm desperate.",Jerry
"Oh, my God, you're a natural. Think of the pickup plays we can run as a father-son duo. There's the Father Knows Breast, there's the Bush Dynasty, the Lick Father, Lick Son.",Barney
"Oh, no, no. I couldn't do that.",Jerry
Why?,Barney
"I have a family now. That's my wife Cheryl, my daughter Carly... she's in college. This is my son J.J. I was hoping you could come over to dinner sometime and meet them.",Jerry
"You're all wearing matching sweaters. That's cute. Look, I got to get going, Jerry. But, uh, this was great. Glad we did this.",Barney
"I made him wait all these years for me and... I'm just not the guy he wanted me to be. I know I don't deserve it, but... I need another chance to connect with my son.",Jerry
We think you should give him another chance. That's the real reason we're out here. He lives ten minutes away.,Lily
What?,Barney
You're having dinner with him tonight.,Marshall
"No, I most certainly am not. Look, I met him. He's not my kind of bro and that's that.",Barney
Are you sure it's not more than that?,Robin
"Guys, get it through your heads. I am never gonna talk to my dad again.",Barney
"No, Barney. I'm never gonna talk to my dad again. But your dad is alive and he lives just down the road.",Marshall
"Fine, I'll go.",Barney
"Awesome. Um, Lily, keys. ",Marshall
Hello. You must be Barney. I'm Cheryl. It's just so nice to finally meet you. I love that suit.,Cherryl
"Oh, thank you very much. And I love your...coat. I love your coat.",Barney
"Oh, that's your coat, Barney. I just took it from you.",Cherryl
"Well, I do love it. It's doing a nice job covering up that chair.",Barney
Guess now we wait.,Lily
"Hey, I got an idea how to pass the time. A little trivia game. Robin, reindeer: real or fake?",Marshall
"Okay, I'm not an idiot. Reindeer are obviously f... re... fake?",Robin
"Yikes! I'm surrounded by a bunch of dum-dums. Good thing I don't have any gaps in my knowledge. I am perfect. Oh, for the love of God, guys, enough already.",Marshall
"What, baby?",Lily
You've been treating me with kid gloves ever since my dad died.,Marshall
That's not true.,Robin
"Robin, don't disagree with Marshall.",Lily
I'm sorry.,Robin
I first noticed it at the bar.,Marshall
"Hey, Lily, (",Marshall
"It ages well, that's the thing.",Barney
You guys like my new soul patch?,Marshall
"Righteous hair tab, brotha.",Robin
"And once I figured it out, I started doing crazy stuff to see how far you'd let me go. Hey, guys. This is Rex. He's a possum. I found him in the trash. He lives with us now.",Marshall
I love him.,Lily
"Lily, we are living with a possum. Rex is violent and he hates us.",Marshall
"But, baby, you just lost your dad. None of us wants to upset you.",Lily
"Please. If you guys really want me to get over the worst tragedy of my life, I'm begging you, tear me a new one. But not like Rex tried to in my sleep last night.",Marshall
"J.J., dinner. When I got your letter, I dug this up. You were probably too young to remember, but this is you, this is me, and, of course, ZZ Top.",Jerry
I do remember that. I climbed up on that dude's lap and told him what I wanted for Christmas.,Barney
"Yeah, I used to love taking you backstage. You were the coolest little kid.",Jerry
"Hi, Barney. It's great to finally meet you.",Jj
"J.J., I'm talking to Dad right now. God.",Barney
"Seriously, it's time. What are my gaps?",Marshall
"Well, I guess maybe one gap you have is... you can't wink.",Ted
"Don't you think that maybe we should go home and, uh, do the laundry",Marshall
You can't swallow pills.,Lily
"Ooh, ooh, I got one. You think John Kennedy and Jack Kennedy are the same person",Robin
"So, Barney, I understand you have a pretty big job with a bank.",Cherryl
"Yeah, I do. I make a ton of money. How much do you make, J.J.?",Barney
I'm 11.,Jj
"Oh, well, huh, now we all know you make excuses. I was talking about money.",Barney
"Actually, J.J. has a job. Tell him, J.J.",Cherryl
I got a paper route.,Jj
"Good time to get into print media. Am I right, Dad?",Barney
"Good slam, Barney.",Jerry
Jerry.,Cherryl
It's all good fun. Just ribbing among long lost brothers.,Jerry
J.J.'s a heck of a basketball player.,Cherryl
"Uh, you don't strike me as the athletic type, Jayj. Dad, check it. Triceps. What gym do you go to?",Barney
Fourth period?,Jj
"Sounds like you're having your fourth period. Am I right, Dad?!",Barney
Got him again.,Jerry
Jerry!,Cherryl
"Oh, okay, Barney. Uh, maybe that's enough.",Jerry
Why? J.J. started it. What does J.J. even stand for anyway? J... Jerky... Jerkface?,Barney
J.J. stands for Jerome Jr.,Jerry
Jerome Jr...? Oh. He's... he's named after you. Excuse me.,Barney
I like having a brother.,Jj
You always add too much water to oatmeal.,Ted
"Yes, I drown the son of a bitch.",Marshall
You consistently miss at least one belt loop.,Robin
It's like I'm blind.,Marshall
You're too old to ask to see the cockpit.,Lily
"Whoa. Whoa. Guys, my dad just died.",Marshall
"Aw, honey.",Lily
"No, I'm just kidding. This is great. I really, I really missed this.",Marshall
"Barney, what is going on?",Jerry
This is mine.,Barney
I don't understand.,Jerry
"J.J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop? No, no. I at least get the hoop. I'm taking it with me.",Barney
"Please, just come down and talk to me.",Jerry
"Why? Why should I? You're lame, okay? You're just some lame suburban dad.",Barney
Why does that make you so mad?,Jerry
"Because if you were gonna be some lame suburban dad, why couldn't you have been that for me?!",Barney
"Look, Barney, I know I screwed up...",Jerry
"Oh, screwed up doesn't even begin to describe...",Barney
"I know, I know, I know! I want to fix this, and I don't know how! Please, tell me what I can do! I'll do anything! You're never gonna get it down like that. Barney. Barney! Just put the pointy end into the grooves. That's it. Now turn it. Righty tighty, lefty loosey. I have no good excuse, Barney. It took me years before I was even able to look myself in the mirror for the way I let you down. It took courage to send me that letter. More courage than I've ever had. I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I... I just have no idea where to begin.",Jerry
Can you help me with this?,Barney
"Here, got it. Look, if you... ever feel like you're ready, I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.",Jerry
Bye.,Barney
Are you sure you don't want to talk about it?,Lily
"I'm fine. Hey, Ted.",Barney
"Yeah, buddy.",Ted
"You, uh, still want a basketball hoop out there?",Barney
"Oh, well, I also really liked your outdoor stripper pole idea. Yeah, it's fine.",Ted
"No, you were right. A kid needs a hoop.",Barney
G-N-B is the e-ne-my!,Crowd
nan,Zoey
That's great. I can't wait! That's great. I can't wait!,Crowd
"Ted, why are you dating our arch-enemy?! I mean, Wile E. Coyote wasn't trying to sleep with the Roadrunner.",Barney
Or maybe he was. Think about it. The way that she bats her eyelashes and shakes her tail feathers in his face?  She wants it.,Robin
Isn't it hard for you guys to be on opposite sides of something like this?,Lily
"Of course you feel that way, Lily. You and Marshall have basically melded into one big hermaphroditic blob. And that's fine for you guys. But some of us want a partner who challenges us to grow and evolve.",Ted
You guys are in screaming matches all the time.,Lily
"Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. Growing matches.",Ted
The main character is a young spoiled prince thrust into leadership after the death of his father. It's obviously a modern-day retelling of Henry IV!,Ted
Are you kidding me?! It's Don Quixote...the classic quest story with the hero-jester and his long-suffering manservant!,Zoey
"Okay, clearly, when we're watching Tommy Boy, we're watching two different movies.",Ted
"No, you hang up.",Ted
"No, you hang up.",Zoey
"No, you hang up.",Ted
"No, you hang up.",Zoey
"No, you hang up! (",Ted
"No, you hang up.",Zoey
"No, you...  Hold on.  Hello?",Ted
"For the love of God, will one of you idiots hang up the phone?",Robin
Why would you do that?!,Ted
I-I thought you'd like it.,Zoey
Who likes that?,Ted
I like it.,Zoey
Your relationship sounds exhausting.,Lily
"Well, maybe yours is a bit lazy.",Ted
"Marshall and I have been together 15 years, and the only debate we've had about Tommy Boy is whether it's awesome or super awesome. That's love, bitch.",Lily
I have to quit.,Marshall
Quit GNB?! Why?,Barney
"I need to do better things with my life, okay? There's-There's an opening for an environmental lawyer at the National Resources Defense Council. Sure, it pays less, but I'd be saving the oceans, saving endangered species...",Marshall
"Saving chicken bones and an old boot to make hobo soup? Marshall, you can't pay your mortgage with Hacky Sacks and good vibes.",Barney
"Baby, you have my full support.",Lily
"Well, then, you're not going to be able to pay for that trip to Spain that you've been planning.  Say good-bye to riding around in gondolas, and eating bratwurst and seeing the pyramids.",Barney
I don't think you know what Spain is.,Robin
"Well, I know that a trip there costs some serious lira.",Barney
It's dinero.,Ted
Where? I want his autograph!,Barney
It's graduation goggles.,Robin
What?,Marshall
"Graduation goggles, like with high school. It's four years of bullies making fun of all the kids with braces, even after the braces come off and they can walk just fine. But then, on graduation day, you suddenly get all misty because you realize you're never going to see those jerks again. I just had graduation goggles with that guy Scooby I dated.",Robin
The guy who was basically a dog?,Lily
He was the worst kisser I've ever been with. But the moment I decided to dump him...I suddenly got kind of wistful. : He was a good boy.,Robin
"Yeah. I've been there, too. Every time I'm done having sex with a woman, at first,I never want to see her again. No, that's pretty much it.",Barney
"The point is, you can't trust graduation goggles. They're just as misleading as beer goggles, bridesmaid goggles, and that's-just-a-bulky, outdated-cell-phone in-his-front-pocket goggles. That one was a bummer.",Robin
"You're right. Tomorrow, I'm quitting GNB.",Marshall
"No! You can't quit tomorrow! The lady with the big nipples is coming back to give another sexual harassment seminar, and I bribed one of the maintenance guys to keep the room at a brisk 55 degrees!",Barney
"Baby, more than ever, you have my full support. ",Lily
"You know, sometimes I feel bad for Lily and Marshall.",Ted
I'm starting to feel bad for Ted and Zoey.,Lily
It starts with an... L?,Barney
How can you not remember my name?,Girl
It's like they never challenge each other. They just automatically agree all the time.,Ted
"Well, they don't do that all the time.",Zoey
"Yes, they do.",Ted
"No, they don't.",Zoey
"Yes, they do. It's like they...",Ted
It rhymes with your name.,Girl
And I said my name was...?,Barney
"Baby, I did it! I quit. And then I walked right over to the NRDC, and I took that job.",Marshall
"Oh, good for you, sweetie.",Lily
"Yeah. It's a little less money than I was expecting. I mean, compared to what I was making at GNB, it's nothing. Actually compared to anything, it's nothing. It's nothing. The paid position just got filled, so all I can do is-is volunteer right now. You're cool with that, right?",Marshall
"Baby, if this is what you need to do, we'll figure it out. How's Barney handling you leaving?",Lily
"Hey, Barney, there's a bunch of models in the lobby, and the gossip is one of them is really a dude. You want to play Who's Hot and Who's Scott?",Ted
"It's always the one in the turtleneck, Ted. And no, I don't want to play. Stupid Marshall-... ruined everything.",Barney
"Oh, come on. Everything's not ruined.",Ted
"Guys, everything's ruined.",Man
What? Why?,Ted
"Your girlfriend somehow got the Landmark Preservation Committee to agree to a hearing. If they declare the Arcadian a landmark, the whole project is dead. The good news is, I just got the phone number of a husky-voiced hottie in a turtleneck.",Man
"...so, if the Landmarks Preservation Committee sides with Zoey, your whole project goes down the tubes? You must be furious.",Robin
I'm furiously enjoying being challenged.,Ted
Why don't you admit that your girlfriend challenging your every move is getting you a little m*rder?,Lily
Why don't you admit that Marshall quitting his job and taking an unpaid internship is k*ll you?,Ted
It's not.,Lily
"Lily, the downside to having giant, Japanese anime eyes is that they're easy to read. And yours are screaming, What about my trip to Spain, b*at?",Ted
"Okay, Ted, the downside to having a woman's mouth is, your feminine pout gives away your true feelings. And yours is saying, Oh, Zoey, why can't I be on top just this once?",Lily
We take turns! Sometimes.,Ted
"Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey. I just had the best first day at the NRDC.",Marshall
I'm sorry. Sorry. Something Hershel said at work today.,Barney
Hershel?,Robin
"What, don't you guys know Hershel? Didn't I tell you? Oh, he's the new lawyer who replaced Marshall at GNB. He is so awesome and funny and tall... taller than Marshall... and he knows way more laws.",Barney
"Well, I'm glad you like your new co-worker.",Lily
There's no Hershel! I was just saying that to make you jealous! Why do you insist we play these games?,Barney
"Barney, I'm not playing...",Marshall
Just come back to GNB already!,Barney
I'm really loving my new job.,Marshall
"Oh, and I'm loving seeing you this happy.",Lily
"I'm so glad to hear you say that because I volunteered our apartment for a big NRDC fund-raiser tomorrow night. You're-You're cool with that, right?",Marshall
"Baby, you have my full support.",Lily
"Thanks, baby. (",Marshall
That's how I'm gonna use mine.,Barney
Why in the world do you care so much whether Marshall works at GNB?,Robin
"Care? I don't care. I'm like, whatever. Marshall who? He's stupid. Hershel's way better.",Barney
"Okay, Barney, is it possible that with everything that's gone on with your dad lately, you might have some unresolved abandonment issues you're transferring onto Marshall?",Robin
"Oh! Ugh! You are worse than my shrink. Barney, we have to talk about your father. Barney, I'm not going to teach you how to hypnotize people. You'll only use it for evil. Barney, I am not going to conduct a couples session between you and this woman. She's obviously a prostitute. I don't need this!",Barney
"Ah, Lily Aldrin, half of the world's most perfect couple! I was thinking about that woman's mouth comment, and I have three good comebacks. One: your mom didn't seem to mind it last night on her...",Ted
"Okay, look, Ted, I need a favor. Would you mind driving out to Kennedy with me to pick up this famous ecologist for Marshall's fund-raiser? Apparently, he only speaks Spanish. And you speak Spanish, right? ",Lily
"Hey, Marshall, it's me. Listen, I know I've been kind of a jerk about your leaving GNB. I just wanted to call and say I'm sorry. No apologies necessary. We're good. Good. Um, hey, any chance you might maybe... I don't know... if you're not busy, uh, want to have lunch today?",Barney
"Oh, buddy, I'd love to, but I can't.",Marshall
"Oh, that's cool. No biggie. Another time.",Barney
nan,Robin
How long have you been there?,Barney
You don't remember?,Robin
"Hey. I was in the neighborhood. I just wanted to check in on you. You seemed, um, you seemed really upset the other day.",Robin
"Oh, no, I'm fine.",Barney
"Okay. Well, um, you want to go grab some lunch?",Robin
"Sure. Hey, are you okay if I invite Marshall to join us?",Barney
Yeah.,Robin
"Right. So, um... Chinese?",Barney
"You know, just because Zoey and I are a different kind of couple than you and Marshall doesn't make us a worse couple.",Ted
"You're right. I-If you and Zoey are happy, then who am I to judge? I'm so sorry.",Lily
"Oh, my God, is that how support feels? It's so warm and wonderful. Oh, Lily, I've been so unhappy.",Ted
But I thought you liked being challenged.,Lily
"Nobody likes being challenged! Couldn't she agree with me just once, even on something little, like... like what movie to see or-or what topping to get on our pizza or... oh, I don't know, my lifelong dream of building a skyscraper in New York City?!",Ted
"Well, in her defense, hamburger pizza, Ted? What are you, 12?",Lily
"You were right, Lily. I mean, Zoey's great, but... sometimes I do wish we were a little more like you and Marshall. There he is. Here we go. (",Ted
I'm sorry. I don't speak... whatever it is you're speaking.,Man
"Um, he speaks perfect English.",Ted
"Yeah, I-I know.",Lily
Then why did you ask me to come?,Ted
"So you can drive him to the fund-raiser. Supporting Marshall this much is driving me crazy. I'm going to Spain-- my flight leaves in 45 minutes. Adios, muchacho.",Lily
"W-Wait, what do you mean you're going to Spain?",Ted
"You were right. If I hear myself say Baby, you have my full support one more time, I swear I'm gonna m*rder someone!",Lily
"What are you gonna tell Marshall, huh? And when are you coming back?",Ted
"I honestly haven't thought it all the way through, and I don't intend to. All I know is that I'm a ticking time b*mb, and if I don't do something for me right away, I swear I'm gonna explode!",Lily
"Wow, tha... that's an evocative metaphor to use for your nonthreatening, totally patriotic emotions. U.S.A.! Okay, Lily, I get it.",Ted
Marshall's been asking a lot lately.,Lily
But the thing to do is-is tell him you've had enough.,Ted
"I've never been good at that. And now, ever since his dad died, I-I feel like it's my job to just be fine with everything. But I'm not. I'm not fine that he volunteers our apartment for a giant fund-raiser and that he's not thinking about how we're gonna pay any of our bills and that, apparently, we've given up on trying to have kids.",Lily
Lil...,Ted
"Look, I'm sorry, Ted, I just, I gotta do this. ",Lily
"My bag? Oh, no. I got it.",Man
There's nothing to talk about.,Barney
"You trashed your office today. I mean, you obviously have some deep feelings you're not confronting. And I think they're about your dad.",Robin
"I don't want to talk about it, okay?",Barney
Why not?,Robin
Because I don't. And why am I explaining this to you? You're the most secretive person I know. You never tell anybody anything.,Barney
"I've never... told anyone this before. Um... I was 16. I was awakened around midnight by the sound of my father arguing with his business partner, Andy Grenier. As things grew heated... I watched my father's hand slowly coil around the heavy antique clock on his desk. The sun was just starting to rise over the bramble orchard as we packed the fresh earth down with the flats of our shovels. My dad and I got our stories straight. We walked back to the house in silence and... haven't talked about it since. But sometimes... on a still night... you can still hear that clock, ticking... ticking... : ticking.",Robin
That's... the most harrowing story I've ever heard. Is it true?,Barney
"No. But it did get you to drink three scotches, which is why you're ready to spill your guts.",Robin
Fine! The reason I'm upset about Marshall leaving GNB is... is...the meatball sub.,Barney
Huh?,Robin
It all started months ago in the GNB commissary. It was Meatball Sub Day.,Barney
"Oh, how I used to love Meatball Sub Day. And then, the most humiliating moment of my life.",Barney
"Hey, buddy, I think you got a tiny little bit of marinara sauce on your tie there.",Marshall
"I plotted my revenge for weeks. But nothing seemed right. Then it hit me. The answer was so elegant and simple-- an exploding meatball sub. For months, I experimented. More... marinara sauce. Finally, the sub was perfected. The plan was in place. The snare was baited. And then...",Barney
"...he quit, Robin, he quit! It's Meatball Sub Day today, which is why I wanted Marshall to come over and have lunch. But no. All that work wasted. (",Barney
What is wrong with you?,Robin
"Hey, Professor Rodriguez, thank you so much for coming.",Marshall
"Right over there. Enjoy. Hey. Hey, thanks for picking him up.",Marshall
"Yeah, absolutely. Um, listen, something happened at the airport. Um...",Ted
What?,Marshall
"Well, we got there, and, uh, Lily...(",Ted
"Marshall, hey. Sorry, I, uh, I had to park and-and grab some ice. Sorry.",Lily
"Oh, thanks, babe. You would not believe how much this one has done to help throw this party, Ted. I don't know how she does it. Can't be easy, huh, Lil?",Marshall
"Yeah. Listen, Marshall, I-I need to talk to you about something.",Lily
"No, you know what? Me, too. Um... I want to thank you for being so supportive of me in all this. I've been at the NRDC for less than a week, and I've already done more to be proud of than in two years at GNB. I can't believe how good it feels. But now, it's time for me to find a way to help the Earth and get paid for it, because I can't put that burden entirely on you. So, starting tomorrow, I'll look for something with a paycheck. What do you think?",Marshall
"Baby, you have my full support.",Lily
Ted.,Zoey
Hey! What are you doing here?,Ted
"This is really important to Marshall, so I came to show my support.",Zoey
This you can be supportive of?!,Ted
What is that supposed to mean?,Zoey
"I have the chance to build a skyscraper in the best city on Earth, and who's the one leading the charge to k*ll that dream? My girlfriend!",Ted
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What about my lifelong dream of not seeing every beautiful building in Manhattan bulldozed?",Zoey
You're too young. This isn't fair.,Lily
"We're not going anywhere, buddy. We're gonna stay here right till the end.",Marshall
"Yes, of course, of course... anything.",Marshall
Eat this meatball sub.,Barney
Wh-Where'd you get a meatball...,Marshall
I don't have much time!,Barney
"Okay, yes, yes, of course. Of course. Does this have some sort of special meaning?",Marshall
"Uh, Barney, you got a little marinara on your pajamas.",Ted
"Barney, afraid this is good-bye. Your buzz k*ll of a ma... thinks I'm a... a bad influence on you.",Jerry
What? That's... What is that word you taught me? Bull something?,Barney
"But she's your mother and I'm... you know, I'm just your Uncle Jerry. So, this is the last time I can see you.",Jerry
But you're supposed to take me to see that Zeppelin cover band next week. The night is gonna be... Led-and-Jerry.,Barney
"Sorry, buddy, but this is it. But don't you forget your training. What's a magician's best friend?",Jerry
A drunk audience.,Barney
I'd love nothing more than to be a part of your life.,Jerry
Bye.,Barney
"I am so angry at my dad! Guess who called me today. Go on, guess.",Barney
Mmm. Your dad?,Marshall
My dad!,Barney
Barney Stinson.,Barney
"Hi, Barney. It's your dad. Look, would you like to go fishing with me and J.J. on Sunday morning?",Jerry
"Ooh, hold on, let me check my personality. Oh, no. Turns out I would never do that in a million years.",Barney
"Barney, look... I know you're disappointed that your dad is just... a boring old driving instructor from the suburbs. But that guy I used to be... Crazy Jerry? He was bad news! Drinking, partying, sleeping around. The party can't go on forever. You're 35; I'm-I'm sure you're starting to realize that, right?",Jerry
You do not know how right you are.,Barney
Zero right! We're not getting too old for anything.,Barney
"You sure? I feel like we collectively learn the opposite lesson, like, at least once a year.",Ted
"I have to face an ugly truth. Jerry Whittaker, my own father, is anti-awesome-etic. I know Crazy Jerry's still in there somewhere, but he's trapped under 20 years of lawnmower parties and carpool barbecues.",Barney
"Wow, you know nothing about the suburbs.",Robin
"Well, this Saturday night, I am bustin' him out. I'm gonna make Jerry realize he was wrong about giving up his old life by showing him the awesomest night of all time. And for the awesomest night of all time, I'm going to need the awesomest friends of all time. Okay, who do I know? Guys...! Do any of you know George Clooney?",Barney
"Okay, my dad's almost here. I need everything to be as awesome as possible tonight.",Barney
That's why you brought these guys.,Lily
No. That's why I brought these guys. ,Barney
Improvements?!,Marshall
Yeah.,Barney
"Bro, we are already the four jiggity-jamminest dudes and dudettes this side of... Okay, let's see the cards.",Marshall
"Robin, no one watches the news unless it's a car chase or a nip slip. You are now a professional scotch taster. Lily, Jerry needs to learn that other lifestyles are just as fulfilling as monogamy, so now you and Marshall are in an open marriage.",Barney
Whoo-hoo!,Lily
Gross!,Marshall
"Also, Marshall, you can't just be unemployed, so you are now a gin-swilling, womanizing playwright. And, Ted, just be yourself.  Just kidding. Here's a giant pile of topics you should avoid talking about.",Barney
"Well. Well, this could actually be fun. In fact, I believe it was Oscar Wilde who said, Man is least himself when he talks...",Ted
"Ted, card.",Barney
Ah. You're right... No quoting Oscar Wilde.,Ted
"Finally... Robin, you're dating Ted.",Barney
"Aw, man! Why?",Robin
"I can't have any single female friends lying around. My dad'll be all, Why don't you marry Robin? You guys are cute together. Deep down, you know you were never happier than when you were with her. Uh...  no, thanks.",Barney
"Hey, Barney... love the new identities. Little thing... instead of being a naked super ninja, can I be Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada?",Lily
How good was that movie?,Ted
And... hence new identities.,Barney
"Jerry, you remember Marshall... he's a well-known writer.",Barney
"Playwright. We're all writers, just some of us don't know what our story is yet.",Marshall
"Lily, his wife.",Barney
"Well, most nights. Mama don't let no ring get in the way of a good time.",Lily
That's... a little depressing.,Jerry
"Uh, hi again. Ted. Oh, and, Jerry, you remember my girlfriend.",Ted
Robin. Hi. So nice to see you again.,Robin
"Wait, wait. Jerry, I got to tell you the truth. Guys, I'm gonna tell him. We're also a band.",Barney
"Two, three, four!",Robin
"So, Saturday night... time to cut loose, right? Who wants to split a beer?",Jerry
"Oh, we're not drinking here. Tonight we're going big. Let's see, what club should we hit first? There's Club Was, there's Wrong...",Barney
"Um, those places shut down a long time ago.",Marshall
"Oh, no.",Barney
"Oh, No shut down, too.",Marshall
There's Where?,Ted
Where's Where?,Jerry
"Where's where Was was, isn't it?",Lily
"No, Was wasn't where Where was, Was was where Wrong was, right?",Barney
Okay.,Jerry
Not Okay. That place is lame.,Ted
Okay is Lame? I thought Lame was a gay bar. Or is that Wrong?,Robin
That's wrong. That's not Wrong.,Marshall
"Guys, focus.",Barney
"Oh, I like Focus. Let's go there.",Robin
Where?,Ted
Not Where. Focus.,Robin
I thought Focus was closed.,Lily
"No, Was was Closed. Once Was shut down, it reopened as Closed.",Barney
So Closed is open.,Marshall
"No, Closed is closed.",Robin
I don't know. Third base! Right?,Jerry
"Ew, Third Base is all frat guys.",Robin
"I'll go anyplace, okay?",Jerry
Not Okay. Okay is lame.,Ted
Okay is not Lame. Lame is a gay bar.,Robin
"Guys, shut up.",Lily
"No, Shut up shut down. I can't believe I don't know the clubs anymore.",Barney
"Guys, just pick a club, okay?",Marshall
Not Okay!,Ted
Okay is Lame! Gay bar.,All
"For the record, I was in there once by accident. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced Lam√©.",Marshall
"It's hopeless, isn't it?",Barney
Wow. A lot of these girls are young enough to be our daughters.,Marshall
I know. Daddy's home. And Granddaddy's home! Tonight rocks so hard!,Barney
I might be allergic to this stamp.,Jerry
"Oh, my God, my secret crush is here.",Robin
Mila Kunis?!,Lily
"No, my secret crush. We met a few years ago.",Robin
Hi. I could use a woman's opinion. Is this working for me?,Man
Uh... no. ,Robin
I was trying on the pants.,Man
Oh. ,Robin
"I had to leave before we could finish talking, so that was it. You know, ever since then, I've always... Oh, my God, he's coming over here. Oh. Hello.",Robin
Hi. A few years ago at a department store... did you embarrass the hell out of me?,Man
"Oh, I'm sorry, you must have me confused with the shirt you were wearing that day.",Robin
I should be so lucky.,Man
Hi! I'm Ted! Robin's boyfriend! Nice to meet you.,Ted
Right. Um... it was really nice to see you again.,Man
"Mm-hmm. You, too.",Robin
Yeah.,Man
"Man, isn't this place great?",Barney
"Uh, I don't know. It's so loud!",Jerry
And so bourgeois. Many of plays are about the bourgeois. And ennui. And one rock opera about... a frozen yogurt shop.,Marshall
"Uh, L-Lily, uh, talk about your open marriage.",Barney
"Okay. Well, after a long day of style meetings and photo sh**t and being way too mean to my assistant, I sometimes bang an underwear model.",Lily
My goodness!,Jerry
"I sleep around, too. Just as much. A little more, even.",Marshall
"Oh, uh, only 'cause you have nothing to do all day.",Lily
Are we having this fight again? Writing plays is a real job!,Marshall
I work 90 hours a week subsidizing your real job.,Lily
I won a Tony!,Marshall
I brought French cooking to America!,Lily
What?,Marshall
Let's do shots.,Barney
"Uh, no, thank you, Barney. I have that fishing trip with J.J. early tomorrow. I... I better take it easy.",Jerry
No. Don't you remember what you said to me when I was a kid? Never stop partying.,Barney
"You don't remember the last thing you said to me when I was a kid? Well... you know, why don't you just go back home?",Barney
But I want to hang out with you.,Jerry
"Yeah, well, I want to hang out with Crazy Jerry, not Stay-at-Home Jerome.",Barney
Fine. You want Crazy Jerry? ,Jerry
Oh...,All
"Hey, sugar! Five beers for the table, a Seven-and-Seven for me, and your ten digits for this guy here! Tonight Crazy Jerry's gonna burn this disco down! Whoo! Wa-hah!",Jerry
Can you believe it? This is awesome!,Barney
"Barney, how is that awesome?",Robin
I finally know what it's like to be embarrassed by my dad.,Barney
So you really believe that if we were in an open marriage that you would do better than me?,Marshall
"Hey, you do better than me at a lot of other things, like digesting dairy... and reaching for stuff.",Lily
"Okay, you know what? Game on. If I can score five numbers before you can, then we have sex in the bathroom. But... if you can score five numbers before me, then we have sex in the bathroom.",Marhsall
So our usual wager. Deal.,Lily
"Hey, uh, hey, Jerry, y... you really want to be out here like this?",Barney
"Oh, sorry, small-town preacher from the Midwest, is there a law against dancing?",Jerry
"No, of course not. I... I just...",Barney
"Oh, this club blows. Let's hit the greatest party in the world, the streets of New York!",Jerry
"Yeah! Let's do it! Uh, maybe fix the tie. But mostly, party!",Barney
"Okay, Jerry's gone; Let's break up.",Robin
Okay. I would have stolen you a whole orchestra. There. What's the rush?,Ted
"Well, that guy who came over here who thinks we're dating, I kind of have a crush on him. Can you help me clear it up?",Robin
"Really? That guy? He was, like, a four.",Ted
"A four? God, you are, like, the worst judge of guys ever. Okay, if he is a four, what are you?",Robin
Hey! I'm not perfect; I'm an eight... and a half.,Ted
You're a doofus and a half.,Robin
Fine. Let's go talk to him. Where'd you meet this booger-eater anyway?,Ted
At a close-out sale at Dawes.,Robin
Really? I remember that sale.,Ted
"Hey, Robin.",Ted
"Oh, Ted. Oh, no.",Robin
Look what I just bought. Right? Right? ,Ted
"Hold on. We were dating then. I specifically remember, because we had great sex that night. Great sex.",Ted
Let me guess. Someone wants to knock... boots. Boots. ,Ted
Just take off your damn shirt. Okay.,Robin
All right.,Ted
"All right. Whoa, stop.",Robin
What?,Ted
Stop. Perfect.,Robin
"But I... I can't see, and you can't see me.",Ted
"Yeah. Yeah, just like that.",Robin
You were picturing your crush!,Ted
"Well, somebody had to.",Robin
"Okay, okay, answer me this. Are you absolutely sure it had nothing whatsoever... to do with the boots?",Ted
Yes.,Robin
"Hey... Bottoms up, amigo!",Jerry
": Hey, hey! There we go!",Barney
"Oh, look what I just ripped out of the ground!",Jerry
Oh...!,Barney
I just puked on the hood of that... police car! ,Jerry
"Too bad your playwright friend isn't a lawyer. Barney, I'm so sorry. I'm afraid this is what it's like hanging out with Crazy Jerry.",Jerry
"It's okay, Dad. I never thought tonight would be so awesome! So... next stop, strip club. The Lusty Leopard has a special...",Barney
"Oh, for corn's sake, Barney, I'm not drunk!",Jerry
What?,Barney
"I told you, I don't party anymore, and you wouldn't take no for an answer. So... I used a little... sleight-of-hand... to make you think otherwise.",Jerry
Here you go.,Jerry
"Bottoms up, amigo!",Jerry
But all those crazy things you did.,Barney
Do you happen to remember what a magician's best friend is?,Jerry
A drunk audience.,Barney
"No, no, no. You don't even know! Right here!",Barney
Look. Look what I just ripped out of the ground!,Jerry
Oh...!,Barney
What just happened?,Barney
I... I just puked on the hood of that... (,Jerry
"Well, why do all those things?",Barney
"I figured if I showed you what... never stop partying really looked like, you'd realize you can't do it forever.  Oh, well.",Jerry
You lied to me all night for your own selfish reasons? Daddy...!,Barney
I wanted to hang out with you... you're my son. And since you didn't want to come with me and J.J. On that fishing tri... Fishing trip. I'll never make it back in time now.,Jerry
"Hey, you know, a... a pretty good magician like you probably knows how to, say, get out of a standard set of handcuffs.",Barney
Perhaps.,Jerry
"Well, here's something you didn't know... I'm a pretty good magician, too. ",Barney
Congratulations!,Woman
"Oh, hey! Thank you so much. We're super excited. We're thinking June. (",Robin
You would look so totally hot in those.,Woman
Do you have these in a size 11?,Ted
"So get off the field at the Superdome, because you ain't no saint.",Robin
Hello.,Marshall
"I, uh... Oh.",Robin
"Hi, Robin. Could I have your phone number?",Marshall
We need someplace to hide.,Barney
Where?,Jerry
"No, Jerry, this is not the time to go to another club! We've got to get you back home in time for that trip. But there's no more trains, there's no cabs.",Barney
"Well, uh... I do have a few driving students in the city.",Jerry
Step on it! Jerry...,Barney
Do not step on it.,Jerry
"Jerry, we have got to get you home in time for that fishing trip.",Barney
The laws are there to protect...,Jerry
This is no time for laws!,Barney
"Buckle up, Barney.",Jerry
I am not going to buckle up!,Barney
I am your father! You will listen to me!,Jerry
Hey! How's the open marriage going? Who was the first one to get the five numbers?,Ted
I won that race. My prize... sex in the bathroom.,Lily
And I won that race.,Marshall
"Aw, sorry that secret crush didn't work out for you.",Lily
"Oh, it's okay. I guess it just wasn't meant to be.",Robin
Why are you smiling?,Lily
I don't know. Good night.,Robin
And her fianc√©? The guy's like a two.,Man
How did you do it?,Barney
Do what?,Jerry
"How did you become this? I mean, I love my life, but... I'm not sure I like loving it. Sure, strip clubs...",Barney
You're drifting.,Jerry
"Hey, I'm trying to open up to you...",Barney
"No, Mrs. Perkins, you're drifting! Go on, Barney.",Jerry
"When I think about going for anything more than that, I look at my life, and who I am, and... I'm too far gone. I'm broken.",Barney
"Son, I was far more broken than you'll ever be. And look at me now. Don't get me wrong... settling down is... a challenge. It's the biggest challenge of your life.",Jerry
So how do you do it?,Barney
A magician never reveals his greatest trick. But I'll give you a hint. You gotta meet the right girl. Who knows? Maybe you'll meet her tomorrow.,Jerry
Maybe I've met her already.,Barney
"And park. And emergency brake. I did have a good time tonight. And hey, if you want to go fishing, we got room in the boat.",Jerry
Maybe some other time.,Barney
"Okay. Oh, and, uh... thanks for taking such good care of this. It means a lot to me that you kept it safe all these years.",Jerry
I'm going fishing with my dad.,Barney
This... sucks.,Barney
"Good luck, Marshall. And promise you'll list me as a reference.",Arthur
"Oh, yeah, I worked with Marshall Eriksen... at least I did when he actually showed up.",Arthur
"Marshall! Hey, it's, uh, it's 2:30. If it's no big deal, we'd sure love it if you'd try to get here at least before lunch.",Arthur
Yeah? And I'd sure love to give a rat's ass.,Marshall
Oh! Mr. Eriksen... You're not wearing any pants.,Assistant
Your move.,Marshall
"But Marshall, wh... What about the environment?",Assistant
Screw the environment!,Marshall
"Oh, yeah. We fired him when we caught him clubbing a seal in his office with an even cuter seal. The guy's a maniac. He's just an awful, flatulent r*cist.",Arthur
"Sir, none of that is...",Marshall
"If you want to get back at those jerks, I have a proposition for you.",Zoey
"Invitations for the demolition of The Arcadian. As head of the project, I get to decide how we knock it down. I'm torn between training an actual coyote to use an ACME dynamite plunger, or hooking up a fuse to Eddie Van Halen's guitar that goes off the second he hits the last note to Hot For Teacher. Barney! Barney! Bar... No, no. I'm going to go coyote.",Barney
"Wait. While no one wants to see a, uh, coyote wearing a little hard hat more than me, remember: Zoey's protest could still shut your whole project down.",Robin
"Oh, come on. Zoey's not shutting anything down, standing out there with her stupid megaphone, screaming in the wind; butt cheeks trembling with fury; her perky breasts heaving; her self-righteous nipples...",Barney
"Dude, that's my girlfriend.",Ted
"Point is, we are taking her and The Arcadian down. Am I right, Teddy Westside?",Barney
You know it.,Ted
"Okay. See, that's so weird to me. One second you're defending Zoey, and the next, you're talking about her going down.",Lily
"Glad to know she's also mouthy in a good way. What up? Dude, that's his girlfriend.",Barney
Isn't it tough dating the woman that's trying to prevent your building from being built?,Lily
"At first, yes, but we figured out a great way to deal with it: we never talk about it. And since then, we've really been enjoying each other's company.",Ted
"So, every time The Arcadian comes up, you guys just awkwardly change the subject?",Lily
"Yeah, but you'd be surprised. It doesn't even come up that often.",Ted
"Hey, guys.",Zoey
Hey!,All
Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian.,Zoey
So Oprah's retiring. Oof! What's that world gonna be like?,Ted
"Wait, Marshall's helping you save The Arcadian, now.",Robin
Yeah. Having a former GNB employee on our side is huge for us. GNB is going down.,Zoey
"Yeah, totally.",Marshall
"So, they found water on Mars. What?",Ted
"Listen, um, I hate to go up against my two best friends, but... I really, I really need this right now. I mean, we're, we're cool, right?",Marshall
"Not only do you quit the job I stuck my neck out to get you, now you sabotage the project I'm in charge of? Is this because I brushed Lily's boob with my elbow, the other day?",Barney
That was on purpose!,Lily
I mean this is really like...,Barney
"Barney, please...",Marshall
"Barney sent us pictures of himself. Oh, God. What's he doing to that megaphone?!",Zoey
Oh! Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!,Marshall
"Babe, can I get you a drink?",Lily
"No, I'm still not... ready to put my mouth on anything yet.",Marshall
I know.,Lily
You know what? Screw this. Game on.,Marshall
Can you believe this one? Wants our booth. Keeps giving us the walk-by.,Lily
That bitch is not giving us the walk-by.,Robin
The walk-by with the stink eye.,Lily
Barney! Your wife just called from the hospital! It's a boy!,Marshall
No. I' was... I was...,Barney
"Pfff. Try 283. 250 was months ago. No, no, no. No, I mean, you're totally 250, baby. No, don't. ",Barney
"Oh, bye-bye.",Marshall
"Mr. Stinson... I had to rush down as soon as I got your results. I'm sorry, but your crabs have super-herpes. ",Marshall
"Oh, boy. Look who's back.",Lily
"Look, Lily, I think this girl wants our seats. Should we leave... or stay here Lionel Richie style All Night Long?",Robin
"Excuse me waitress, I'll have a mojito! And you'll have a no-seat-ho.",Lily
"Ah, yes... the sweet, smoky taste of victory.",Marshall
Are you sure it doesn't taste like anything else?,Barney
That's it!,Marshall
Kent! Kent!,Barney
"Oh, God! Ow... Why would you do that to your own jacket?!",Marshall
"That's what you get, you traitor!",Barney
"Oh, really? Really?",Marshall
Yeah. Really.,Barney
Really. That... what...,Marshall
"Okay, enough! You guys are out of here.",Carl
Ejected!,Robin
I meant all of you. You're all banned from the bar. Out!,Carl
Carl! Oh... This has nothing to do with us. You're totally ridiculous. ,Robin
"This stupid feud isn't going to end until Marshall and Barney finally talk about their feelings, cry, and then hug it out like they do on Oprah.",Lily
"Man, what are we going to do without her?",Robin
Oh...,Lily
"Wait, you know what, these guys are not going to get all mushy sober. We need to get these bitches drunk.",Robin
"Yes, but the right kind of drunk. Uh... we should go with something mellow. Maybe red wine?",Lily
"Oh, I don't know. Red wine has kind of an odd effect on Barney. He reaches a point of sad clarity.",Robin
"Ten, nine, eight...",All
"I'm a B-plus. My whole life, I was hoping to be an A, and I'm a B-plus. And I'm okay with that.",Barney
Happy New Year!,All
"If we want them to open up, I say we go straight-up gin.",Robin
Oh... last time Marshall got gin-drunk was at that douchey bar Barney likes to go to. Marshall almost got in a fight that night.,Lily
"Look at this meatball. He's headed right towards me, showing me no respect. Well, if he wants to play chicken, this rooster ain't backing down! Oh. Mirror.",Marshall
How about martinis?,Lily
Absolutely not. I'm not going anywhere near you and a martini.,Robin
Why not?,Lily
"Ooh... You know what would be stupid? If we made out. That would be so stupid. Hey, I dare you guys to dare us to make out.",Lily
Every time.,Robin
I only say that because it would be so stupid if we did. So stupid...,Lily
Uh-huh.,Robin
"Oh, yeah? Well... what about you and absinthe?",Lily
"I don't know. We could have water, soda, purple stuff...",Marshall
We're a dream a baby's having. We're a dream a baby's having.,Robin
"I keep telling you, that didn't happen.",Lily
"It happened, and it changed me. How about daiquiris?",Robin
Maybe. When Marshall has daiquiris... he gets really into how beautiful he is.,Lily
"Hey, Marsh, you know that's another mirror, right?",Ted
Peppermint schnapps?,Lily
No. Peppermint schnapps turns Barney into Richard Dawson.,Robin
Who?,Lily
"The crazy old host of Family Feud, who greeted women by kissing them on the mouth.",Robin
"Hey there, darlin'. How you doin'? Ah, is this your sister? Mmm... Beautiful. Mmm...",Barney
"Hey, where are our chicken wings?",Ted
Show me chicken wings!,Barney
"Good order, Ted! Good order!",All
"Okay, I'm gonna go pick up Zoey, then we're off. See you Sunday.",Ted
"Oh, wait, Ted. Do you have a specific reaction to any kind of alcohol?",Lily
Bourbon. When I drink bourbon... I get weirdly good at b*at.,Ted
"Peace, I'm out.",Ted
"Yeah, Ted, I hate to tell you, but the bourbon only makes it sound good to you.",Lily
Peace. I'm out.,Ted
"You had to take that away from me, didn't you? ",Ted
"Well, enjoy Martha's Vineyard. Hopefully by the time you get back, we'll be allowed back into MacLaren's.",Robin
What do you mean?,Ted
Barney and Marshall's feud got us banned from the bar. We lost our booth.,Lily
Stop.,Robin
"Man, how did things get so screwed up?",Ted
You and The Arcadian are ruining my life! What?,Ted
I thought we weren't talking about...,Zoey
"We're talking about this. Look, I can handle you trying to prevent me from fulfilling a life-long dream. That's just being in a relationship. But now? You turn my best friend against me?",Ted
Marshall made his own choice. Why aren't you mad at him?,Zoey
"Because he's going through a lot right now. He, he's looking for something to believe in, and you took advantage of that. You're, you're just like those Internet swindlers who tricked him into paying 300 bucks for a lock of Sasquatch fur.",Ted
"You cannot compare The Arcadian to a Ziploc bag full of Turkish armpit hair. The Arcadian is a beautiful, magnificent hotel.",Zoey
Okay. You know what? We're settling this once and for all.,Ted
Okay.,Zoey
We've cross-referenced every alcohol with Marshall and Barney's reaction. What's the right drink for this situation?,Lily
"Well, they're not talking. They're not even looking at each other. That reminds me of those awkward Sunday dinners with my mom, my dad and his mistress. Families, right?",Robin
I-I guess. That... seems like a whole other thing. We need a drink that will start a fight.,Lily
Do you know what I had to do to get you that job?,Barney
Do you know what I had to do to will myself to show up every day?,Marshall
"What, wear a wrinkled suit and not give a damn about what your hair looked like?",Barney
I showed up with wet hair once! Once!,Marshall
"Oh, my God.",Barney
"Well, here we are. I had a reservation at a four-star inn overlooking the ocean but, uh... How can that compete with such a beautiful, magnificent hotel? Welcome to The Arcadian. So here's the deal. If you can last until sunrise in your precious Arcadian, I'll join your side.",Ted
You're on. This place is fantastic. They even left a chocolate on the pillow.,Zoey
That's not a chocolate.,Ted
"Okay, now we need to get them something that will make them emotionally vulnerable and completely, pathetically honest.",Robin
"Yeah, we need a drink that, that takes subtext and turns it into text. Yeah.",Lily
"See, ever since the death of my father, I have been drawn to the idea of preservation. That's why The Arcadian speaks to me.",Marshall
"Ever since my father walked out on my childhood, I've had serious abandonment issues. You walking out on me like that...",Barney
"Oh God, I didn't even think of that...",Marshall
"It made me wonder, What could I have done to make him stay?",Barney
"Look, you didn't do anything wrong. It wasn't you, Barney.",Marshall
That's what everyone keeps saying but people just keep leaving me.,Barney
Wow. That got real o'clock.,Robin
Yeah. We need to get them up and having fun.,Lily
"Dance, my puppets, dance!",Robin
Now do you see why I'm always interfering in other people's lives?,Lily
"Oh, God, totally!",Robin
"Well, we're here for the night. Might as well have some fun. Dare to join me?",Zoey
"Dust just flew out of that comforter in the shape of a skull. Whoa, something just passed through me. Can you get STDs from the ghost of a prostitute?",Ted
What are... What are you doing in our bathroom?,Ted
This bathroom for entire floor!,Woman
Okay. Final round. What simple act will get the boys to finally forgive each other?,Lily
"Sharing a brandy. Which is what I walked in on my parents doing once. Brandy was my father's mistress. God, parents. Right?",Robin
"Again, just a whole other thing, sweetie. Where'd they go? Oh, no. They did shots.",Lily
What? What is it?,Robin
What's the worst thing they could possibly drink right now?,Lily
Your place or mi... Your place or mi... Le-Let's go to your place. Mm.,Barney
"Uh, these were supposed to be for a romantic dinner on our balcony as we were serenaded by the sounds of the ocean. But I guess we'll have to settle for what sounded like two very large men having sex next door... with a third very small man.",Ted
I think that small man sounded very moved by The Arcadian's beauty.,Zoey
"Okay. What is it? And don't give me, It's beautiful. Don't give me, It's magnificent What is it about this place that makes you so passionate to save it?",Ted
Well... When I was a little girl... my family used to live here.,Zoey
"Why, why have you never told me that?",Ted
"I never told anyone that. It makes it sound like it would be impossible for me to be objective, but... The truth is, I... I loved growing up here. We had just moved to New York. We were completely broke. But my mom told my sisters and me that The Arcadian was a castle. And we believed her. I know it's not what it used to be... but this building is a part of who I am. And that's why I want so badly for you to like it, too.",Zoey
I love you.,Ted
"I love you, too.",Zoey
"Come on in, you're un-banned. I gave these guys some drinks and they calmed down and made up.",Carl
"Well, what drink finally did the trick?",Robin
I love you.,Marshall
I love you.,Barney
"Uh, no. N-Not right...",Barney
"You know, I guess this place isn't so bad.",Ted
"See? With a little renovation, we could restore it to its former... What was that?",Zoey
What was what?,Ted
I think it went under the bed.,Zoey
I don't see anything.,Ted
"That, that was... that!",Zoey
"Oh, my God! It's the cock-a-mouse!",Ted
The what?,Zoey
"Cock-a-mouse. Part cockroach, part mouse. It used to live in our apartment. It must have settled here, and... Oh! Look, it had babies! Good for it.",Ted
Ew.... I give up. You win. Let's go!,Zoey
"Be well, my friends! Aw, just how we left them.",Lily
Morning. Who wants breakfast?,Robin
You have some coffee? So I can throw it in this traitor's face?,Barney
"Oh, yeah? Hey! Hey! Do you guys have some pancakes, because I... would really like some pancakes. They're fantastic. Let's be honest, I love them. But I hate this guy!",Marshall
I thought they made up last night.,Lily
"Damn it, I know what happened.",Robin
I love you.,Marshall
"I love you. Uh, no. N-not right...",Barney
"Carl, a round of champagne.",Lily
Ooh! The champagne.,Lily
We gave them one drink too many. They must've blacked out and forgotten the whole thing.,Robin
"What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?",Barney
"Dude. That's my girlfriend. And you know what? I'm on her side now, too.",Ted
"Whoa, whoa, you have got to be kidding me. Ted...",Barney
"Okay, what drink can fix this?",Robin
Mama's done with this drama. What drink can fix the headache these clowns are giving me?,Lily
I got it.,Robin
Right?,Robin
Time is music the planets make. Music the planets make...,Lily
What is that?,Woman
"A symbol of strength and constancy, the stone lion of The Arcadian has watched over New Yorkers for generations. So remember: if the lion head stonework is regal, then tearing it down should be illegal. Well. Did you like that? All right, uh... We must make sure the lion is always there. Destroy The Arcadian? Oh, no, don't you dare. Yeah? Yeah? Okay. Try this one on for size... If you want New York's history at your beck and call...",Marshall
"All right, thank you, Mr. Eriksen.",Chairman
I just have...,Marshall
"We will now hear from the architect of the proposed GNB Tower, Ted Mosby. Now, uh, Mr. Mosby, let's just cut right to the chase. Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?...Okay, it's k*ll me. What rhymes with beck and call?",Chairman
Wrecking ball. Don't go swinging no wrecking ball.,Marshall
Ah...,Audience
Thank you.,Marshall
"Mr. Mosby, do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark? It's not a difficult question.",Chairman
"Yes. The Arcadian should be a landmark. And then the crowd gasps: Oh, my God! Did he really just say that? Oh, heavens! Oh, my stars! I must clutch my pearls!",Ted
So these things are generally attended by old Southern ladies?,Zoey
"Almost exclusively. But here's my point: If they ask GNB's chief architect... aka me... if The Arcadian should be a landmark, and I say yes?",Ted
"That, no, that wasn't The Arcadian being destroyed; that was GNB's hopes of destroying The Arcadian.",Zoey
"I'm sorry, I should have been more clear.",Marshall
Yeah. The Arcadian's gonna be all like...,Zoey
Nice.,Marshall
I have a message from Barney.,Robin
Meet the new lawyer I hired to help save The Arcadian.,Zoey
"What kind of dirtbag doesn't stand by his best friends, but instead, sides with some self-righteous bitch with a pointless cause and a megaphone?!",Zoey
"Dude! That's my girlfriend. And ya know what? I'm on her side now, too.",Ted
"Message from Barney? That's my cue to leave. Good night, guys. I love you.",Zoey
"Mmm. Love you, too.",Ted
"All right, what's the message? 'Cause if it's another hypothetical yet eerily accurate drawing of my boobs...",Lily
"Yeah, I have that, too.",Robin
Damn it.,Lily
"All right, here's the message. (",Robin
"Oh, we've got the big LPC meeting in two days. I have my whole presentation worked out. I just need to find a good rhyme to end on.",Marshall
Why does it need to rhyme?,Ted
"If you end an argument with a rhyme, it's convincing all the time.",Marshall
"Yeah. It's why in our apartment: If you're a-hopin' to score, don't leave your socks on the floor.",Lily
And she hasn't since.,Marshall
"Okay, okay. A couple of things. Lily, how'd I do?",Barney
Nailed it.,Marshall
"Secondly, Ted, I'm sorry I said mean things about Zoey. Are you really going to walk away from this project just because you're mad at me?",Barney
"It's not because I'm mad at you. Barney, The Arcadian was designed by a guy named John Clifford Larrabee. And even though he's been dead for half a century, it's my duty, architect to architect, to keep his work alive. Please tell me a little part of you understands.",Ted
I understand. Zoey has magic lady bits.,Barney
What?,Ted
"Zoey's lady bits... are magic, and that's how she controls your mind. You see, every few hundred millennia, lady bits leap forward...",Barney
"I know you're only just getting started, but this is already gross.",Lily
I once knew such a girl.,Barney
It was last call. In this very bar.,Barney
What...?! No... What?!...No... What?!,Barney
"Um... thank you for, um, not using a first name in that story.",Robin
"Barney, this is about the building.",Ted
Come on. This is so about the girl.,Barney
"Okay, fine. It's about the girl! I am doing this for Zoey! I'm in love with her. Look, I know it's early, but there is a very good chance Zoey might be the mother of my children. So, in addition to doing this for John Clifford Larrabee, I'm also doing this for Luke and Leia.",Ted
Wait. She's gonna let you name your kids Luke and Leia?,Lily
"Not if I knock down her favorite building, she isn't. Barney, I'm sorry.",Ted
"Oh, you're not sorry now, Ted Mosby. But you will be. You... will... be.  That's how you do an evil laugh. Ciao for now.",Barney
"Hi, Arthur. Everything okay?",Barney
"No, everything's not okay. My stupid wife got custody of Tugboat. God, I should have kept her hidden in a cage in the basement.",Arthur
Isn't that animal cruelty?,Barney
I'm talking about my wife.,Arthur
"Oh. That's fine, then. So listen, you know Ted, the architect?",Barney
"Yeah, I know your friend Ted.",Arthur
"So, if Ted stood up at that big meeting tomorrow and said that he thought The Arcadian should be a landmark... You wouldn't just fire him, would you? ",Barney
"No, Barney. I wouldn't just fire him. I'd also fire you.",Arthur
Come again for Big Fudge?,Barney
"Can you believe that?! I can't be unemployed, Robin! My job is my identity; It's who I am. It gives me the confidence I need to convince girls I'm a fighter pilot.",Barney
I-I don't understand. Why would he fire you?,Robin
I don't understand. Why would you fire me?,Barney
Have you already forgotten how Mosby got that job?,Arthur
By being the best architect available?,Barney
No.,Arthur
By... being Latino?,Barney
No. Let me refresh your memory. We were in this very room.,Arthur
"Guys, I'm telling you, if Ted Mosby isn't fantastic, fire me.",Barney
Damn it! I was kidding?,Barney
"I'm not kidding! Oh, by the way, Arthur, uh, how are things with you and your wife?",Barney
"Really good. In fact, I just put all my assets in her name. Smartest thing I've ever done.",Arthur
Damn it!,Both
"No, you'd better make sure Mosby doesn't screw up tomorrow. Because either that building is going down, or you're going down.",Arthur
They're going to fire him? That sucks. He loves that job.,Ted
And he's been doing it for years.,Marshall
"Okay, what does Barney do at GNB?",Lily
No idea.,Ted
He has a lot of keys.,Marshall
"Okay, Ted, can you just please think about this before you...",Robin
There's nothing to think about. I-I can't lose Zoey. That's the only thing that matters to me right now.,Ted
"Okay, Ted... you know I love Zoey. But, look, sometimes... I go play chess in the park. And the key to chess... Okay, I play online. But the key to chess... Okay, it's Angry Birds! But the key to Angry Birds is to always try to see every possible outcome. And to... hit some pigs with rocks or something. I don't know; I don't play. I can't get it to download. The point is, this thing with you and Zoey? I can see it going three possible ways. There's the first scenario.",Robin
The chairman asks you...,Robin
Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?,Chairman
You say...,Robin
No.,Ted
And Zoey dumps you on the spot.,Robin
We're done here.,Zoey
There's the second scenario.,Robin
The chairman asks you...,Robin
Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?,Chairman
You say...,Robin
Yes,Ted
"And you're happy for, like, a second, until you realize the building you helped save has just become a monument to everything this woman made you give up, and you resent her for it, so much so, in fact, that you dump her.",Robin
We're done here.,Ted
You said there was a third scenario.,Ted
Right.,Robin
The chairman asks you...,Robin
Do you think The Arcadian should be a landmark?,Chairman
But before you can answer...You're hit in the neck with a blow dart fired by the ninja Zoey's ex-husband hired to assassinate you.,Robin
That one's less likely. What I'm saying... what I hate saying... is this. You and Zoey are gonna break up. But you can still save your career and Barney's.,Robin
"Okay, first of all, no ninja's getting a jump on me. I have the reflexes of a jungle... ",Ted
Tree?,Lily
"Second of all, I don't care that the odds are stacked against us. I'd rather try to make this work with Zoey than spend the rest of my life alone playing Angry Birds, which, by the way, I've shown you how to download, like, 20 times.",Ted
"I've got to say, I'm with Ted on this.",Lily
Thank you.,Ted
"I mean, yes, this is a huge, divisive issue for them. Which means no matter what happens, there's gonna be a lot of resentment. Probably lasting for years... infecting every single moment of the rest of their relationship. So, in conclusion, I'm with Robin on this.",Lily
Thank you.,Robin
"Barney, what are you doing?",Ted
"Who is this Barney? My name is John Clifford Larrabee, architect of The Arcadian. And I am visiting you in a dream...",Ghost
Really? 'Cause it feels more like my insane friend renting a costume and breaking into my apartment in the middle of the night for what I wish I could say was the first time.,Ted
"Look, it's a dream, it is. So just... okay? Theodore... heed my words: do not try to save The Arcadian.",Ghost
"Barney, there's condoms in the drawer. Just take them and get out.",Ted
Whoa! Lighting change!,Ted
"Theodore, you know The Arcadian is a badly built, architecturally unimportant rat's nest designed by an overpaid, plagiarizing ether addict with two thumbs. This guy.",Ghost
"Okay, yes, it's-it's a terrible building, but... does that mean we have to knock it down? I mean, it's not bothering anyone. Just anyone who lives in it... Or looks at it... Or smells it.",Ted
"New York is never finished, Theodore. She's a lady only a handful of architects ever get to dance with. Do not miss your turn.",Ghost
"The Arcadian has to go, doesn't it?",Ted
Indeed.,Ghost
You realize this kind of screws up my personal life.,Ted
"Mo' buildings, mo' problems.",Ghost
"This is a dream, right? Because, Barney, I swear to God, if that's you...",Ted
"Mommy's got Magic Lady Bits, Ted.",Ghost
"Hello, Mr. Lion.",Zoey
"Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair",Ted
"Hey, I met you right...(",Zoey
Right. And I mistook you for a prostitute right... here.,Ted
"As far as you know, I still could be one. And you, my good man, have run up quite a tab.",Zoey
Worth every penny.,Ted
All right... this was fun. I'm gonna take this cab. Big day tomorrow. We need to get some sleep. And yet...,Zoey
"No, we should get some sleep. But this was fun.",Ted
Yeah. It's nice getting one last look to remember what we're trying to save.,Zoey
Exactly.,Ted
You okay?,Zoey
Yeah. Good night.,Ted
"Mr. Mosby, I'm going to ask you one last time. Should The Arcadian be a landmark?",Chairman
"No, it shouldn't be a landmark. There are a lot of important buildings in New York. The Arcadian isn't one of them.",Ted
"E-Excuse me, I have a question for Mr. Mosby. If he doesn't think The Arcadian's worth saving, then whose voice is this? (",Zoey
"Is that your voice, Mr. Mosby?",Chairman
"Yeah, that's me.",Ted
"This is a nightmare. I can't believe she kept that tape. The LPC's gonna come back with a decision tomorrow, and based on today...",Ted
They're gonna landmark the hell out of that place.,Robin
Yeah.,Ted
"We'll end up out of a job, all thanks to some stupid, only sort of awesome lion head.",Barney
"Better get used to that lion head. As of tomorrow, it's gonna be there till the end of times. And all because of my sweet, sweet rhymes.",Marshall
What are we gonna do? We should buy a bar.,Ted
We should totally buy a bar!,Barney
We should absolutely totally buy a bar!,Marshall
It's really the only sensible idea right now.,Robin
"Oh, oh, and ready? It's a theme bar. It's a courtroom.",Marshall
Yes! Where the bartenders wear sexy judges' robes.,Ted
I'll allow it!,Marshall
"The only court where you show up, then get served.",Barney
Ho! You're judged by a jury of your beers.,Robin
That's not bad.,Ted
Just stop it! No one's buying a bar. Right now we have a little problem. Let's just think of a solution.,Lily
"Lily, it's over. The good guys lost.",Ted
"I don't know, homegirl is pretty diabolical. If there is a plan that'll get us out of this, it's somewhere inside this butter churn. She'll think of it. I'm just gonna sit here... and watch it happen. ",Marshall
"Oh, this ought to be good.",Barney
"Oh, this is good!",Barney
We have to find Arthur right now.,Ted
"What is so difficult about this?! Tugboat figured this out in, like, five minutes. This is bush league!",Arthur
"Hey, Arthur!",Barney
"Oh, cute dog!",Robin
"No! Tugboat, my other dog, that was a cute dog. This little disappointment is nothing but a cheap facsimile. I said it! Yeah, my love is reserved for dogs that go to the bathroom on command instead of wasting my time!",Arthur
"Listen, Arthur, Marshall's wife has an idea for how we can save, not saving The Arcadian.",Barney
"Oh, his wife has an idea. Let me tell you about wives, okay? They leave you and take your best friend with them. You're not Tugboat! You'll never be Tugboat!",Arthur
"Uh... Hey, Arthur?",Barney
I guess this one's kind of cute or whatever. So... so what's the idea?,Arthur
"Okay, first hear my demands. One, Ted and Barney keep their jobs. Two, when you guys do finally blow up The Arcadian, one of them gets to push the button.",Lily
Fine! What's the idea?,Arthur
Well...,Lily
"Last night, this committee took a vote, and while we have all felt from the very beginning that The Arcadian is, well, an eyesore... Mr. Mosby's surprising testimony about the lion's head stonework left us no choice but to declare it... a landmark. But then, something else happened last night. That same lion's head stonework...disappeared. So... that makes our job a little easier. Motion denied.",Chairman
Zoey... Zoey!,Ted
"All right, what do you have to say for yourself?",Zoey
I don't know. Sometimes... things have to fall apart to make way for better things.,Ted
We're done here.,Zoey
"Okay, you don't have to hold back anymore. You may now say what you really think of Zoey.",Ted
"I don't know, she may have been right about that lion's head. It gave The Arcadian a regal elegance. Then again, it goes really nice with my duvet. ",Barney
I want to press the button to blow up The Arcadian!,Ted
I want to press it!,Barney
I want to press it!,Ted
I want to press it!,Barney
"Guys, I dated you both, and neither of you is good at pressing or even finding the button. After some awkward pawing around, that building's going to fake an implosion, say, Baby, that was great and go to sleep.",Robin
"It's just a button, okay? Can we just talk about something else, please?",Robin
"Well, I ran into Zoey yesterday.",Ted
That's the first time since the breakup. How's she doing?,Robin
"I'm still unemployed, so I had to get a couple roommates.",Zoey
Saving money. Making new friends. No downside.,Ted
"They're all 22 and sell drugs. Which means they're not taking them. So, that's a win.",Zoey
"Well, I can tell you're really busy so I should... I'll let you go.",Ted
Hey. You want to get coffee sometime?,Zoey
You know that coffee is code for I want to get back together right?,Robin
"Well, at first I wasn't sure, but then she said something that got me thinking.",Ted
I want to get back together.,Zoey
"Don't worry, we're not. I just, I feel bad Zoey's having such a hard time.",Ted
"You know what might... make you feel better, buddy?",Barney
I'm not letting you press the button.,Ted
I want to press the button!,Barney
You're not pressing the button! It's my button!,Ted
"He's out printing out a whole new batch of r√©sum√©s because he misspelled the phrase detail-oriented. And when he gets back home, he is going to find his favorite soup there waiting for him.",Lily
"Oh, that's sweet, Lil, but didn't you guys get food poisoning here one time?",Robin
"Three times. But they're really nice about it. Their policy is, Get sick, get a free gallon of soup.",Lily
"This is Mr. Buttons 2. Now, after what happened to Mr. Buttons 1, we have to be very gentle with... ",Lily
This was about to be my third bowl. Why shouldn't I eat the soup? Why shouldn't I eat the soup?,Marshall
"Hey, Mr. Architect, big day for you tomorrow, huh?",Robin
Yeah. Getting to stand next to me while I press the button. That is going to be legend... wait for it...dary adjacent. Legendary adjacent!,Barney
You okay?,Robin
Yeah... no. This morning I was talking to the foreman.,Ted
"Hey, hotshot.",Foreman
"You know, Rod, um, I'm loving that nickname, and I can tell it's totally affectionate, but, uh, I'd prefer Ted.",Ted
"Yeah, but you're such a hotshot, I figured I'd just call you hotshot. Pick one. And make sure you like it. There's going to be 50,000 of these in your big, hotshot building, hotshot.",Rod
"50,000 lightbulbs! What if this one's too bright? What if this one flickers and gives everyone a weird headache? Do you know how many people it takes to change 50,000 lightbulbs?",Ted
"Are these people Irish, Polish, blondes... what are we dealing with here?",Barney
There's just-- there's so many decisions to be made. What if I make all the wrong ones and my building just sucks?,Ted
Not possible. Your building is new. And I have one rule: New is always better.,Barney
You can't keep saying you have one rule if they're always different rules.,Ted
"Ah, but new is always better is my oldest rule, which makes it the best.",Barney
"Hi, Marsh.",Ted
"Oh, hey, buddy.",Barney
Hey. Everything okay?,Robin
"Lily got food poisoning from some soup. And then I ate the soup exactly three hours later. Which means I can see exactly three hours into my future, and it... doesn't... look... good. I tried to be supportive.",Marshall
"Oh, baby, can you just hold me, please?",Lily
"Of course, baby. ",Marshall
"But it doesn't help it that when Lily gets going; she sounds like a velociraptor from Jurassic Park. But then I realized a man can do a lot of living in three hours. So, I'm out experiencing this beautiful, crazy dance called life. Ah, my last meal. MacClaren's famous jalapeno poppers. My doctor says I need to eat healthier, so I figured the round-trip flight these babies are about to take will land them permanently on the no-fry list. Good-bye, my friend. It's been a hell of a ride. I have to...",Marshall
"Hey, babe. The gang says feel better.",Marshall
"Mm. Thanks. Wait, you didn't tell them I had food poisoning, did you?",Lily
"Um, I...",Marshall
"Marshall, when it's stomach stuff, you just say under the weather, or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things.",Lily
I know. I just said that you had the sniffles. No one is picturing anything but little red-nosed you under a blankie with some hot tea.,Marshall
I wonder what end it's coming out of Lily right now.,Barney
I bet it's her tushie.,Robin
"I bet it's both. Hey, speaking of explosions... enough already, Ted! That button's mine!",Barney
"I got you this job, so I... Say what?",Barney
Whatever. It's yours. I gotta run. ,Ted
You...,Barney
Why would Ted just give up the button like that? And he forgot his phone. See you in an hour.,Robin
Who's that from?,Barney
Zoey. They're meeting for coffee. Ted's getting back together with her!,Robin
Why would Ted get back together with Zoey? He's doing great.,Barney
"After a breakup, we all think we're doing great. Sometimes the tiniest trigger can unravel you and send you crawling right back.",Robin
"No, I refuse to believe that Ted is getting back with Zoey because of lightbulbs.",Barney
"Uh, Ted's gone back for less.",Robin
"Hi, Natalie. You want to get coffee sometime?",Ted
Bro.,Ted
"Ted, I only have one rule.",Barney
But I can't reach the worst part. ,Ted
"Coming up next, our two local pandas, Ming Ming and Bao Bao, are expecting a baby.",Announcer
"Robin, you want to get coffee sometime...?",Ted
"Get it together, bro.",Robin
"According to my calculations, at 6:00 p.m., my body is gonna pay out like the most disgusting slot machine in the world. That gives me two hours to go do the interview and still get back in time.",Marshall
"Oh, but, baby, what if you hit the jackpot early?",Lily
Don't worry. I'll be prepared.,Marshall
"I'm talking your ear off, sorry. Is there anything I can do for you, sweetie?",Neighbor
Can... I... borrow... an adult diaper?,Marshall
We've got to stop Ted. Where are they meeting?,Barney
"Okay, Zoey wrote, Meet me at 6:00, where it all began, where you gave me the orchid at the intersection.",Robin
"Well, that's good. All we have to do is think back to the time Ted told us about his first date with Zoey.",Barney
Amazing first date with Zoey! We met at the intersection... ,Ted
"Aw, that's sweet.",Robin
You weren't listening either?,Barney
"I was in a coma. I mean, who pays attention to that sappy romantic crap?",Robin
"Yeah, I wasn't listening, either. Ted really can go on about a bitch.",Lily
Great. He could be anywhere. We're flat out of clues.,Robin
"Hey, wait. Ted left a message. I could hear it 'cause I was in the bathroom... blowing my nose... I have the sniffles.",Lily
"Damn it, Marshall.",Lily
"Okay, we're never gonna find him.",Robin
"Wait, wait, wait. That's was a subway announcement in the background. I speak conductor.",Lily
"Hey, Lily, hope you're feeling better. Marshall told us...",Voice
Got it. Ted's at... ,Lily
That's the intersection.,Barney
That's in Brooklyn. How are we ever gonna get there in time?,Robin
Way ahead of ya.,Barney
Hello!,Ranjit
Marshall. Jake Bloom. Great to meet you.,Man
"Hello, hi.",Marshall
"Hey. Oh, I'm sorry about the stench. We're suing a factory that's been dumping raw sewage into a local marshland. Yeah, ten minutes ago, I was knee-deep in liquefied human feces. And that was just on the F train.",Jake
I can't believe Ted's getting back together with Zoey.,Robin
I know. They're a total train wreck.,Barney
Unmitigated disaster.,Robin
Worst couple ever.,Ranjit
"Yeah, almost as bad as us.",Barney
"We were a mess. Do you remember how awful I looked by the end? My hair was falling out, my skin was gray, my back was hunched.",Robin
"What about me? I got so fat, at the end of a date, you'd unhook my bra.",Barney
You were the only boyfriend I ever motorboated.,Robin
"Thank God we're not sentimental saps who panic and get back together. Seriously, why would people do that?",Barney
I guess I get it.,Robin
What do you mean?,Barney
"Well, no matter how bad things got... Ted really did love Zoey for a minute there. Didn't he?",Robin
"Yeah... he did. And... she loved him, too. Didn't she?",Barney
"Yeah, she did.",Robin
Smith and Ninth Street.,Ranjit
"So, let me show you some of the gut-wrenching environmental atrocities that we were working to stop, okay? Here, pop quiz. What is that?",Jake
That's a seal.,Marshall
"Bingo! Yes, a bloated seal corpse rotting in industrial waste.",Jake
Mm-hmm.,Marshall
"Now, wait till you see what we found when we cut him open.",Jake
"Okay, where the hell are they?",Robin
Maybe this isn't the intersection.,Barney
"Well, maybe it is and we're too late. Man, I wish we'd gone to Brooklyn sooner.",Robin
"I know, right? Ever since the Trader Joe's opened up, Brooklyn is so... whatever.",Man
Wait. Where'd you get that? ,Robin
"Across the street at the Intersection. So, uh, you guys... want to buy some weed or...?",Man
She's alone! There's still time! But where the hell is Ted?,Barney
"Wait a minute. On their first date, he brought her an orchid. How much do you want to bet he's gonna do it again?",Robin
"Brilliant. But wait, he had a huge head start on us. There's no way he's still in there unless he spent a half an hour picking out the perfect orchid.",Barney
"Now, do you know what that is?",Jake
A pile of rotting seagull carcasses covered in toxic sludge.,Marshall
"Being eaten by rats. Exactly. Now this next slide... Oh, I'm sorry. That's my wife's water birth. I don't know how that got in there. Anyway, that's all my questions.",Jake
"Now, I like to set aside 20 minutes at the end of every interview for your questions. So don't hold back. Whatever you got inside there, you just let 'er rip.",Jake
"When it's stomach stuff, you just say under the weather or people start picturing you doing unspeakable things.",Lily
I have food poisoning and I'm about to start volcanoing toxic sludge out of both ends! ,Marshall
Nailed it.,Lily
"Thanks, Julia! No, on second thought. ",Ted
You can't get back together with Zoey just because you're freaking out over a lightbulb.,Robin
"I'm not freaking out over a lightbulb! I'm freaking out over 50,000 lightbulbs! I can't do this! I only got this job because you gave it to me, Barney. I didn't earn it!",Ted
"Look, Ted, the future is scary. But you can't just run back to the past because it's familiar. Yes, it's tempting.",Robin
But... it's a mistake.,Barney
You're right. ,Ted
"Hey, baby, how'd it go?",Lily
"Lily, this year, this nasty schoolyard bully of a year will not stop punching me in the face. How did we kick off 2011? My dad died. And now after five months of unemployment, I just blew my dream job. The good news is, in a few seconds, I'm gonna start heaving my guts out because that's what life is for me now: just losing what's inside until I'm just empty.",Marshall
"Baby, come here.",Lily
I just want to shut my eyes for a few seconds before it starts. ,Marshall
"Okay, hotshot. Mr. Stinson. Who's gonna do the honors?",Rod
He is.,Barney
You sure?,Ted
Yeah. You earned it.,Barney
All clear!,Rod
"Hey, new is always better, right?",Ted
Always.,Barney
"Ten, nine, eight...",Rod
"Lily, it's a miracle. I didn't get sick. I didn't get sick.",Marshall
"I know, baby. I'm pregnant.",Lily
...one!,Rod
I'm proud of you for giving Ted the button. It meant a lot.,Robin
"It's just a button. Can we talk about something else, please? (",Barney
Hi.,Norah
How you been?,Barney
Fine.,Norah
"Look, I don't know why you would possibly say yes to this, but would you want to grab a cup of coffee with me sometime? 20 minutes. I was such a jerk to you. You can spend the entire time calling me every dirty name in the book.",Barney
I speak four languages. I'm gonna need more than 20 minutes.,Norah
"I'll call you. You look beautiful, by the way. And here I thought it was too late for sundresses.",Barney
"It's never too late, Barney.",Norah
Challenge accepted.,Barney
Best man? You're being summoned.,Lily
"Geez, what now? ",Ted
What do you think of this tie?,Barney
What do you think of this tie?,Barney
"Thank you, God. Barney Stinson needs you just before her marriage, is that there must be a dead prostitute in the closet, right?",Ted
This one is better?,Barney
"The tie is well, and you know, this is perfectly normal pinball shortly before his marriage.",Ted
"I'm not scared. It's just that I think once I'd put this tie, I could never remove it. I should wear it again and again. And of course this tie is fine now, but how I will cope when it becomes big and it annoy me? Do I made a mistake? Is what I would have been happier with the other tie? Ted, I can tell you a big secret?",Barney
"Yeah, sure.",Ted
I do not really talk about the tie.,Barney
"Yeah, I realized that Barney.",Ted
I wonder if this will be a disaster. And if it was the worst of all marriage?,Barney
Impossible. It has already been the worst of all marriage.,Ted
That of Punchy.,Barney
Marshall has really ruined all that.,Ted
Hi. Guys before you go that you bother to read my toast for the wedding?,Ted
"Yeah, no problem, of course.",Barney
Ok,Ted
Woow.,Barney
There are several different versions.,Ted
"Ted, why you work so hard on this speech? Punchy has applied with a karaoke microphone in a bowling alley.",Robin
"Ok, I have never said that, but over the years, some of my friends from high school asked me to give speeches at their weddings, and they have not gone well.",Ted
"These marriages have become associated as the worst moment of my life. The love between Joel and Mora is magnificent. I thought I had the same thing... Until my fiancee left me at the altar last week. I was asked not to talk about that, so I will not do. I sit in front of her home at night sometimes. It changed hairstyle.  After losing my job last week, I asked not to give this toast...  No, no, no! The happy couple should hear. It's over. But from the ashes of your divorce statistically probable, hope can be reborn. That is why I opened my own architectural firm Mosbius Designs.  Mosbius Designs went bankrupt. But the love of Alex and Jessica reminds us that... Oh, my God!",Ted
A Schmosby classic.,Punchy
Wow. Punchy has posted weaknesses of your life?,Robin
"Oh, not that much. Now I am a total disaster for all my old high school friends. And a lot of people in Finland are the big stuff. This is why I have to type this toast.",Ted
"Ted, you can hit you something else to this marriage.Let the big binder. The only thing you have to bring it to Cleveland.",Barney
"Here's your speech. In single file, girls. No big. ",Barney
This is ridiculous.,Ted
"Yeah, you're right. This is Cleveland. In single file, girls. ",Barney
I will not Punchy's wedding to brag... cover of a magazine.,Ted
"Barney, he did not need your advice. You never called Nora.",Robin
I'll call you.,Barney
"It's never too late, Barney.",Nora
Or you called? It's not that I want to know. So what? I do not care. You did?,Robin
I did not call.,Barney
"Slim, Barney. I was really, really, really for both of you.Who wants chicken wings?",Robin
"Me. Or maybe we should make the hot sauce on Barney, now that's a sissy.",Lily
"I'm not a wimp. Nora wanted a professional. Not me.That's it. And yes, Robin, I want chicken wings.",Barney
Cannibal.,Lily
"Ok, next tour for me.",Robin
"Oh no, no, it does that.",Marshall
I can not wait to tell everyone.,Marshall
"Baby, no one can tell anyone. Not before three months. I do not want you to have bad luck.",Lily
"It's a bit superstitious, do not you think?",Marshall
"Whenever you take a plane, you lick.",Lily
Has it been crashed once?,Marshall
Do not say a word until we know that all is well. Ok?,Lily
"Ok, so everything will be okay. Promised.",Marshall
How can you guarantee that?,Lily
I'm so happy. I do not know how we will keep this secret for three months.,Marshall
Relax. It will be easy.,Lily
What'll it be?,Bartender
"Four beer, plus a non-alcoholic.",Lily
You're pregnant! Come here!,Bartender
"Stand ready, Cleveland. The last guy who has conned you so hard and then disappeared was LeBron James.",Barney
You're going to try to make you anybody here?,Robin
What?,Barney
"My God, Barney, tonight is a magical night between the annoying friend of Ted and that is what this-face. A little respect.",Robin
"It's not just be someone. This is a market survey. You see, my legendary success rate of 83%...",Barney
17. He always reverse.,Ted
"... never happens by accident. Each technique used to drag a woman has been thoroughly field tested. By eliminating improper techniques in small markets like Cleveland. I know which will go to New York. For example, tonight marks the inauguration of the escaped prisoner. Do prisoners on the run are sexy?",Barney
"No, no.",All
We'll never know unless I try tonight.,Barney
Schmosby! Oh! Shit head! What's up?!,Punchy
You really feel this ring now.,Marshall
Glad you all here.,Kelly
"Open Bar. Bottoms up, shit head, because it is the father of Kelly who pays, and he hates me.",Punchy
It's true.,Kelly
"Who drinks? Go, go.",Punchy
"Oh, no, thank you.",Lily
You're pregnant or what?,Punchy
"Let's be crazy! You're going to drink for two tonight, baby.",Lily
I'll do it for the child.,Marshall
"During the season of super bowl, but if they mean the super bowl. Go Vikings.",Marshall
"Prisoners on the run are not sexy. At the same time it was a faulty concept. Next step, the patient zero.",Barney
"Lily, you go getting drunk tonight.",Robin
"That's all you, baby.",Lily
I'd to 4 glasses without eating.,Marshall
In nine months I would push a baby Eriksen with a pumpkin head out of my hoo-haa. I think Dad can handle a few cocktails and more.,Lily
Well done.,Marshall
Hakuna Matata!,Lily
I gotta go get some air.,Marshall
"My God, have you seen this guy. I want Barney is my new boyfriend. No, thank you.",Robin
Wait a minute. It's your voice of truth.,Lily
My what?,Robin
"Whenever you try to pretend that you're kidding but in fact it is profoundly true, you are using that voice.",Lily
I would like the Spice Girls back together. They were awesome. The worst.  It was me. I farted. It is this type.  birthday gift from my father. All I want from him is that he tells me he loves me. Just kidding.This pen is sufficient. It's enough. It is completely sufficient.,Robin
"Oh, my God. You always have feelings for Barney. Admit it, you still have feelings for Barney.",Lily
"You're more drunk than I thought. I mean, look at this type.",Robin
"Wait, wait, wait, before you leave, please do respond to this survey to help me better to seduce you in the future.What does not work for you in this game of seduction? Does A do not you think that I hold a bailiff of the world? B or fingernails disgusts you?  Sea...",Barney
"Eager to hear your toast, Schmosby.",Man
"Yeah, here is the whiner.",Punchy
Wait. You encourage me to cry at your own wedding?,Ted
"Yes, everyone encourages you. Plus some new friends from Finland. Hey, good luck, Schmos.",Punchy
"Take that. Shows them how much you're great. Say your ad, not ashamed, say that.",Barney
"I've told you, I'm not here to brag, ok?",Ted
"That's it. You're too polite to brag. Well, fine. Let me do it. Because the only person on Earth who loves more than Ted Mosby Marshall Eriksen Marshall Eriksen is drunk. So here we go.",Marshall
Barney and I have tried and failed. It was there two years. Why would I start? It would not make sense.,Robin
"It does not make sense. It's chemistry. Listen, I always them a sixth sense for these things. And now that I'm pregnant... deep in me in my uterus, I see things more clearly. You and Barney have that kind of chemistry that is still there.",Lily
Really? That's why he tries to Lebron anything that moves?,Robin
"It does not work for you because A vampires are offside, B or pretend that I invented Facebook was a bit too?",Barney
You're the reason why he never called Nora. You're the reason why he only tests tonight. And you're the reason why he continues to try to impress. Chemistry.,Lily
"Wow! Ted! It's really you on the cover of New York.Now, you say yes.",Marshall
Stop please.,Ted
Schmosby. What is this magazine?,Man
"You know what, Clay? It's nothing.",Ted
"You know what? This is not nothing. Clay, my friend Ted has designed a building, Clay. What do you do, Clay?",Marshall
"Well, I'm still working in the rental car...",Clay
"Hear, hear, Clay. No major publication does write about your small agency?",Marshall
"No, no, no items. My life is monotonous. I think the only news is that little thing.",Clay
"Oh my God, look at this little baby. She's so cute. All I want is to put her little feet in my mouth. You have created something really beautiful.",Marshall
It's all for me.,Clay
"I mean, it's still huge... The building, you know?",Ted
"Hey, kid.  So this little angel is already every night?",Marshall
I spent many sleepless nights... to design this building. Nothing symbolism there.,Ted
Forget it. There is no chemistry between Barney and me. It's over.,Robin
Oh really? Prove it. Go talk to him.,Lily
Why should I tell him about that?,Robin
"Because in the depths of himself, even if he does not know yet, Barney wants to be with you. And if it does not happen, he deserves to know.",Lily
"Well. Barney, just to make things clear...",Robin
"I know what you gonna say. Show in Cleveland, how it goes.",Barney
Barney... I...,Robin
"Sorry. Oh, my God, this is Nora. She finally ended up reminding me.",Barney
"Wait, you said you'd never recalled.",Robin
"I lied. I called, like, five times. Wait, wait! You guys you know better than anyone how I show this stuff. Will you help me please? I would like just once to see what it feels like when you do not quite fair.",Barney
Yeah.,Robin
Hi Nora. Thank you for reminding me. The reason I'm calling...,Barney
To tell you how I feel.,Robin
To tell you how I feel.,Barney
I know it did not work the first time...,Robin
I know it did not work the first time...,Barney
... and it makes no sense...,Robin
... and it makes no sense...,Barney
... but I can not help thinking that goes well together.,Robin
... but I can not help thinking that goes well together.,Barney
Is there a part of you that wants to try again?,Robin
Is there a part of you that wants to try again?,Barney
"Baby, I can not do that. I have to tell someone that we are pregnant.",Marshall
"Eriksen, be strong. Keep it a secret.",Lily
There are babies everywhere. It's minefield of sweetness. Look at this little bastard.,Marshall
"Marshall, stop that. Remains strong. Can not you let me hold a little baby with his little cheeks... so cute... and little arms and little legs... This little bastard has dimples. We will tell everyone I'm pregnant.",Lily
Yeah!,Marshall
Are you okay?,Ted
No. And you?,Robin
Not really. Want to talk?,Ted
Not even a little bit.,Robin
It might help you feel better.,Ted
"Okay, well, we'll make a deal. You go first and then I still do not tell you what's wrong.",Robin
"Okay. All my friends from high school, are there with their wives and children. And me? My appointment is a dirty magazine.",Ted
"As in high school. Sorry, I had to.",Robin
"I've always believed in fate, you know? I will go in a magazine Bagel, I would see a pretty girl in the queue reading my favorite novel, whistling the song I had all week in my head, and I would think, Wow, this is perhaps the good.  Now I think I just know that bitch will take the latest Bagel.",Ted
You've been too focused on your work.,Robin
"No, it's more than that. I stopped believing. Not like some depressed, I cry during my speech. Not the way I had not even noticed, until tonight. It's just that every day I think I believe a little less and a little less and less. And... it sucks. What should I do about it, Scherbatsky?",Ted
You're Ted Mosby. You do it again to believe it.,Robin
"What, in fate?",Ted
"A chemistry. If there is alchemy, you just need another thing.",Robin
What is it?,Ted
The timing. But the timing is a bitch.,Robin
"Hey, we always have our market 40 years? If you are still only 40 years...",Ted
"I'm all yours. Unrelated, architects make a lot?",Robin
Not enough.,Ted
Shit.,Robin
Schmosby to you in two minutes.,Man
"Ok, promise me two things. One, believe in you again, and two, do not cry during the toast, Schmosby.",Robin
I promise.,Ted
We're having a baby.,Lily
For real?,Robin
For real.,Lily
A little attention everyone! This is the time for which we are all here tonight. The speech Schmosby!,Voices
We are here tonight to celebrate love. The love that brings us a new life...,Ted
Hey!  This is not a whiner. They are tears of joy. Ted is happy for his friends because it's the best guy I know. And do you know why he is happy? For the beautiful young lady is pregnant here.,Marshall
How did you know...? It must have a secret!,Kelly
Will the Browns!,Kelly
"In the season's Super Bowl, but if they mean the Super Bowl. Go Vikings!",Marshall
"You always pay for it all, eh?",Punchy
"No marriage will be as bad as that one, huh?",Ted
"I chose the right tie, huh?",Barney
"You've nailed. And be glad it is not the tie-duck. Oh, the tie-duck.",Ted
"You're a good best man, Ted. You'll cry during the toast, right?",Barney
"Oh, I'll cry too.",Ted
Between.,Barney
"Ted, the bride wants to see you. Seriously? Will you be wearing this tie?",Lily
"Oh my God, guys, I still have a hangover. Did I really ruin a marriage?",Marshall
"No, you did not ruin a marriage. Only reception.",Ted
And Miztva Bar next door.,Robin
And my dress. And your dress. You put a dress at one point.,Lily
"Ok, you know what, it's good. I'll be a father, and I want to be the kind of man that my child can watch. Therefore, new resolution... I will never drunk! I'm serious!",Marshall
I've done it again!,Marshall
What happened to your leg?,Lily
"Oh, nothing. I must have coffee with Nora. She is still angry, so I need some sympathy points. She loves musicals, so I'll tell him that I fell off stage during a performance of Man of La Mancha. What do you think?",Barney
Lose the cast.,Ted
A one-man show... I love it!,Barney
Let us be clear... this woman is angry against you because you lied to him. So your solution is to claim that you broke your leg?,Lily
"You're right. A cervical neck brace! Thank you, Lil. I should have to talk to you soon. I trained all day with these crutches and one who has left in my hall is likely to need it.",Barney
"Well, I have good news. As you know, I recently decided to start out and see the girls.",Ted
Is this you?,Woman
"Uh, yes. Salvation. I'm Ted.",Ted
Hi.,Woman
"That's great, Ted.",Lily
It was a completely random moment. The kind that you can create yourself... At least I thought.,Ted
"Oh, no. How have I landed on it? Salvation. Ted Mosby.  I plead guilty. Salvation. Ted Mosby.  It's embarrassing. I will be on the cover of An egg on my face magazine. But I'm not. I'm on the cover of that one. Salvation. Ted Mosby.",Ted
"completely random 16 times in one day, and 16 of these, 10 were single. Of these 10, seven have loved what they saw. Of these seven, four were women. And these four, two have given me their real number. And I go with both.",Ted
"Guys, this is Garrison Cootes.",Marshall
"If I did not work, I could finish... in kind, a Taco Belle somewhere. And nobody wants that. Unless you want to do this, like this you would have free tacos, since you are my friends. But now I need you all calmiez!  Hello.",Marshall
"Marshall, it's Garrison Cootes. Sorry for not having reminded you earlier but I was stuck. What's funny, because I'm literally stuck in a swamp. Well, anyway, here I am trying to collect some samples for this trial on the pollution that we are working.",Garrison
I love the work you do.,Marshall
It's a...,Garrison
"No, I mean it.",Marshall
"No, no, there is a crocodile a few meters from me. So I'll just ignore the warm urine running down my leg right now, and tell you that we are very interested in your case.",Garrison
He's interested!,Marshall
"Obviously, we need to do some sort of verification purpose, you see, an investigation of crime and a Google search, but if nothing seems wrong to us, it takes you.",Garrison
"It's fantastic, Mr Cootes!",Marshall
"Well, I'm going. It's very funny because in fact I really have run away.",Garrison
The crocodile you saw?,Marshall
"He is coming, yes.",Garrison
"Hi Nora, thank you for coming.",Barney
What happened to your neck?,Nora
"My naked...? Oh, that's nothing. I was playing in a One Man Show at Fiddler. There was this scene...",Barney
"Wow, this one has a beautiful chest.",Nora
Breasts...,Nora
"Wait, Nora, waiting... No, please. I'm sorry.",Barney
What is wrong with you? What kind of people need to lie like that?,Nora
"Someone who likes you, really. And suspicious, and probably accurately you do it over more later, and therefore he feels the need... I'm sorry, you spoke of this fantastic pair of tits, right? Because I seek, and I do not see them.",Barney
"I just had two rencards following. With two adorable girls, four cappuccinos and wait...  I do not know which was the best. Here are the girls: Jessica is a student in Rhode Island, she traveled around the world, speaks four languages and plays the piano. Claire and fought for the bill. So I do not know. It is torture. You see, the two girls have the potential to be really special. They both deserve a second round.",Ted
Wait a minute. You're going to handle two girls at once? You do not think you should pick one before it gets too serious?,Lily
Define serious.,Ted
"Well, it's complicated. I think it would be when you have expectations, emotional involvement...",Lily
"Third base. Seriously, third base.",Marshall
So I can go to the second two with no problem?,Ted
Treat yourself my friend. Treat yourself. Oh no.,Marshall
Poor. This is very bad.,Marshall
"Thank you, Stacy. Wesleyan has a cafeteria. Thank you to the generous donation of... Marshall arrives on camera, naked.",Girl
Oh! Oh! Someone there mentioned generous donation? I'm Marshall Eriksen. But you can call me Biercules!,Marshall
"Well, it could be anyone. And thin, I had forgotten this story Biercules.Who made this site first?",Lily
Pete Durkenson.,Marshall
Of course.,Ted
This is the guy who convinced you to run around campus naked?,Robin
"I wanted to join a club that I left three days later, because the clubs are stupid and elitist. And I also discovered that it was not a club.",Marshall
"Oh my God. This is huge! I am invited to the Ball of Architects, the annual gala honoring the greatest architects of the city. Oh no. You guys see the problem?",Ted
This is an annual gala that honors the greatest architects of the city?,Robin
"Robin, this is the biggest celebrity event of the year. In taking a girl at the ball, man, you reached third base. Whatever the girl I invite, it will be the steady girlfriend of Ted Mosby by the end of the evening. Ok, we stop to sit between two chairs. Robin, bring me my notebook. It's time to make lists of pros and cons.",Ted
Let me clarify something for you. I do not date guys who lie to me.,Nora
"Okay, I did not know. Mea culpa. So, from now, more lies. I never lie to you. I'm serious. Ask me anything.",Barney
OK Have you ever managed to get in bed with a woman that you lied?,Nora
Have I ever... If I'm totally honest... Yes.,Barney
More than once?,Nora
"More than once... Wow, this is... I guess if we... so, technically, there were a number of times I've lied to a woman to sleep with her.",Barney
They were worth what?,Nora
"Nine or ten for most. There has been a 4 once. It was an easy girl.But, Nora, after that, I had to flee so fast. Honesty is good.",Barney
What was the lie?,Nora
You want me to tell all the lies I have told to put a woman in my bed?,Barney
A bed or any other place where you're sent into the air.,Nora
You are good.,Barney
"Pete, Pete. Hey!",Marshall
"Biercules! Come here, man.",Pete
"Hey, I tried to call you all night.",Marshall
"My God, sorry. I should have responded but it was Thursday night.",Pete
It is Sunday.,Marshall
And you know what that means. Edward bottles with money!,Pete
"Ok, you know this old video of me?",Marshall
I watch it every day.,Pete
You have to take away the internet. Genre immediately.,Marshall
"There are two ways for me to do it: Either you give me $ 4 million, or help me to go to the bathroom because I can not...",Pete
"Yes, both are non-negotiable refusal.",Marshall
"So, I'm sorry we could not handle together. But if you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of the game to Edward bottles of money, and the competition is raised.",Pete
Who are you playing anyway?,Marshall
Just myself.,Pete
"I do not have time to explain how I got there. I just need someone to suck the poison. The surgeon gave me a new face, darling. You realize that I am alive? My name is David Beckham. If I castais only the white swan, is the role for you. No, I am a lesbian. What I wear is just very realistic.",Barney
"Ok, let's move. What was the worst? The best of the worst? The cream of the crop?",Nora
"Oh, once I am the soul man. There was this pretty girl who only go out with black.",Barney
"Barney! Oh no, I knew it.",Woman
I can not choose. They are both extraordinary.,Ted
"If architects had only two b*ll*ts, eh Ted?",Robin
"I knew it. Ted, left or right?",Lily
"Yes, yes, good idea. Let fate decide? I will choose the left.",Ted
"Ted, to your heart, you know that you love one more than the other.Believe me, takes the other.",Robin
"Uh, I have perhaps not been clear is the... Robin Ball Architects.This event is a very hip.",Ted
"Ok, name one celebrity who will be there.",Robin
Lenny Kravitz.,Ted
Lenny Kravitz will be there?,Robin
Yes. He is there every year. And it's a rock star.,Ted
"You know, Ted, in hindsight, it is too early to choose between these two girls. Takes a friend. Like, I dunno, maybe a friend who has a poster of Lenny Kravitz on his wall, and may or may not have dated this post and transported from his high school...",Robin
This list of pros and cons leads to nothing. I need a color scale.,Ted
"Pete, please. I am unemployed. I have a huge mortgage. A baby arriving. And I'm about to lose a job that I really need because of a drunken video of 15 years ago.",Marshall
"Ugh, you mean? Biercules, what's going on? Looks like you're another person. The guy in this video was cool. It had potential. It could have been president of a club one day.",Pete
There is no club.,Marshall
There he is just a troublemaker.,Pete
"It's not that I want to be a troublemaker. Fair, I must be one. I'll be a dad. You have children one day, you will understand.",Marshall
"Dude, I have 4 children.",Pete
"Pete, please, remove the video.",Marshall
"Ok, Biercules, I will remove it. If... you can b*at me to the game of my choice.",Pete
Oh no.,Marshall
"And I choose the beautiful game, the sweet science...",Pete
"Pete, please, I'm tired...",Marshall
The sport of kings...,Pete
I do not want to play Edward bottles money.,Marshall
"I was going to the darts, but it's Edward bottles to money!",Pete
"And that made all the lies related to space. Let the world of sports. Oh wait, I forgot for a space: I was bitten by a snake space. You have to suck all the poison around my... ",Barney
"Okay, Barney, I have things to work tomorrow at 8 am which means I have just enough time to spend 11h in my shower to wash away all that.",Nora
"So that was cool. I can remember, or...?",Barney
"Barney, you're funny, beautiful, and really nice. But you are also a sociopath.",Nora
"Well, I count three for and one against.",Barney
How can you still believe you have a chance with me?,Nora
"Because you are sat here all night. You could leave, but you did not. Listen, Nora, these lies, it was the old me. But I swear I try to change.You... make me want to change.",Barney
How I know this is not a lie?,Nora
I will prove it. I'll show you how much I'm serious. I will not leave this restaurant as I have not got a second date with you.,Barney
Goodbye Barney.,Nora
I do not laugh. It is a restaurant 24h/24. I will stay forever if necessary. And I will. Just water for me please.,Barney
"Ok, so the red bar indicates the level of attractiveness, blue, intellectual stimulation, green, emotional connection, yellow, compatibility aspirations of life, and purple, so she tried to pay or not.",Ted
"Well, it looks like Jessica wins in the first four categories.",Lily
Do not fight in...,Ted
"Oh, that? It's nothing. It cost me three months' rent, and uh, I have never worn because I bought it for a big party to which you would have asked what did not happen. But, you know what? Do not feel guilty.",Robin
What big event?,Ted
This thing with your uncle.,Robin
"His funeral? It fell into the water, he emerged miraculously from his coma.",Ted
And I forgive you. Now I can have my place and meet Lenny Kravitz?,Robin
I've done it again!,Marshall
"Oh, dear. You're still drunk. I can not believe that I made the bet.",Lily
"Just to be clear, I've done it again!... Am not referring to my current state of inebriation.",Marshall
What does it therefore reference?,Lily
"My name is Marshall Eriksen. I'm 33 and if my potential future employer, Garrison Cootes, look at this... Prostrate to Biercules!",Marshall
Well... it could be anyone...,Lily
"Oh, God...",Pete
"Pete, it's Lily Aldrin. I'll be brief. You're going out this video of Marshall. You know why? Because I am friends with three girls with whom you came to school, and girls say it all together. Every small detail.Huh. So... tick, tick... Pete so goes the clock in the little dick.",Lily
Pete has a small dick?,Ted
"I have no idea. Well, what do you take?",Lily
It had to happen eventually. I tried so hard to suppress my... side-idiot-who-is-not-care-for nothing he rebelled and has struggled!,Marshall
It's for sure!,Robin
"Who do I crazy? I'm not ready to be a father. I thought I was, but it's like... My father never did such things, you know?",Marshall
"But if he did, you would love all the same. And to be honest, you do not love to come across a video of him running down the street naked shouting, Hey, Marshall, look at me! I have a stalactite on the head! ",Lily
Oh! Hi guys! Oh! My neck! Uh... oh! Hey! Look at this!,Barney
"Barney, what are you doing here?",Robin
"Oh, I told Nora that I would not leave until I have no second appointment, and I intend to do. I am here since 9 o'clock. I still need another minute. Say I'm crazy, but I'll stay here as long as it will not be returned.",Barney
"That's what I want. Barney's feelings for Nora, I want to feel again. I do not want to choose between two girls. I want to be completely baba one of the two.",Ted
"Yes, the stupid thing that makes us turn the head, pretty cool.",Lily
"It's not bad. Also, for posterity, a statement drunk guy! I would not drink again.",Marshall
Carpet Biercules! Yeah!,Marshall
Hello?,Marshall
Marshall! Garrison Cootes.,Garrison
"Yes, Mr Cootes. How are you?",Marshall
"I wanted you to know we had conducted our inquiries, and there is something annoying.",Garrison
"Sir, the fact is that...",Marshall
"The rainbow in this sample is definitely related to chemical plants. Ok, I... Skip a line... We love you! It takes you.",Garrison
"It's fantastic. Thank you, Mr Cootes.",Marshall
"Well, nothing. Oh, and when you're in the office, try to wear something Biercules. Ok? Wow, that was a big snake.",Garrison
"Oh, there was a snake in the swamp?",Marshall
"No, I was talking about your penis. See you tomorrow.",Garrison
I got the job.,Marshall
Yes!,Lily
And I think my boss is already sexually harassing me. But he saw the video and he does not care!,Marshall
Saw what? Maybe the video is not so bad after all.,Lily
Yes. Hello?,Marshall
"Hey Marshall, I'm Pete Durkenson. We all went to Wesleyan.",Pete
"Yes, no, I know. Pete, we drank together yesterday.",Marshall
"Absolutely, now, the message from Lily makes sense. Listen, do not worry Bro ', I remove the video.",Pete
You know what? Let her.,Marshall
"As you wish, Biercules.  Scalpel.",Pete
You know what? That's good. I want my children to see every part of me.,Marshall
Yes. Even the side where you route the East Village naked.,Lily
I will remember Pete.,Marshall
It's a good idea.,Lily
Thanks for taking me.,Robin
"The pleasure is mine. And you know, you might find it interesting.Some of these guys represent the history of New York.",Ted
"Yes, yes. Where is Lenny Kravitz?",Robin
"Right there. Leonard Kravitz, world-renowned architect. This guy is a star. He will make his famous reading of 90 minutes on the beams.",Ted
"Well, great. I'll go find one myself and hang myself.",Robin
Ok,Ted
"Oh my God, guys, I still have a hangover. Did I really ruin a marriage?",Marshall
"No, you did not ruin a marriage. Only reception.",Ted
And Miztva Bar next door.,Robin
And my dress. And your dress. You put a dress at one point.,Lily
"Ok, you know what, it's good. I'll be a father, and I want to be the kind of man that my child can watch. Therefore, new resolution... I will never drunk! I'm serious!",Marshall
I've done it again!,Marshall
What happened to your leg?,Lily
"Oh, nothing. I must have coffee with Nora. She is still angry, so I need some sympathy points. She loves musicals, so I'll tell him that I fell off stage during a performance of Man of La Mancha. What do you think?",Barney
Lose the cast.,Ted
A one-man show... I love it!,Barney
Let us be clear... this woman is angry against you because you lied to him. So your solution is to claim that you broke your leg?,Lily
"You're right. A cervical neck brace! Thank you, Lil. I should have to talk to you soon. I trained all day with these crutches and one who has left in my hall is likely to need it.",Barney
"Well, I have good news. As you know, I recently decided to start out and see the girls.",Ted
Is this you?,Woman
"Uh, yes. Salvation. I'm Ted.",Ted
Hi.,Woman
"That's great, Ted.",Lily
It was a completely random moment. The kind that you can create yourself... At least I thought.,Ted
"Oh, no. How have I landed on it? Salvation. Ted Mosby.  I plead guilty. Salvation. Ted Mosby.  It's embarrassing. I will be on the cover of An egg on my face magazine. But I'm not. I'm on the cover of that one. Salvation. Ted Mosby.",Ted
"completely random 16 times in one day, and 16 of these, 10 were single. Of these 10, seven have loved what they saw. Of these seven, four were women. And these four, two have given me their real number. And I go with both.",Ted
"Guys, this is Garrison Cootes.",Marshall
"If I did not work, I could finish... in kind, a Taco Belle somewhere. And nobody wants that. Unless you want to do this, like this you would have free tacos, since you are my friends. But now I need you all calmiez!  Hello.",Marshall
"Marshall, it's Garrison Cootes. Sorry for not having reminded you earlier but I was stuck. What's funny, because I'm literally stuck in a swamp. Well, anyway, here I am trying to collect some samples for this trial on the pollution that we are working.",Garrison
I love the work you do.,Marshall
It's a...,Garrison
"No, I mean it.",Marshall
"No, no, there is a crocodile a few meters from me. So I'll just ignore the warm urine running down my leg right now, and tell you that we are very interested in your case.",Garrison
He's interested!,Marshall
"Obviously, we need to do some sort of verification purpose, you see, an investigation of crime and a Google search, but if nothing seems wrong to us, it takes you.",Garrison
"It's fantastic, Mr Cootes!",Marshall
"Well, I'm going. It's very funny because in fact I really have run away.",Garrison
The crocodile you saw?,Marshall
"He is coming, yes.",Garrison
"Hi Nora, thank you for coming.",Barney
What happened to your neck?,Nora
"My naked...? Oh, that's nothing. I was playing in a One Man Show at Fiddler. There was this scene...",Barney
"Wow, this one has a beautiful chest.",Nora
Breasts...,Nora
"Wait, Nora, waiting... No, please. I'm sorry.",Barney
What is wrong with you? What kind of people need to lie like that?,Nora
"Someone who likes you, really. And suspicious, and probably accurately you do it over more later, and therefore he feels the need... I'm sorry, you spoke of this fantastic pair of tits, right? Because I seek, and I do not see them.",Barney
"I just had two rencards following. With two adorable girls, four cappuccinos and wait...  I do not know which was the best. Here are the girls: Jessica is a student in Rhode Island, she traveled around the world, speaks four languages and plays the piano. Claire and fought for the bill. So I do not know. It is torture. You see, the two girls have the potential to be really special. They both deserve a second round.",Ted
Wait a minute. You're going to handle two girls at once? You do not think you should pick one before it gets too serious?,Lily
Define serious.,Ted
"Well, it's complicated. I think it would be when you have expectations, emotional involvement...",Lily
"Third base. Seriously, third base.",Marshall
So I can go to the second two with no problem?,Ted
Treat yourself my friend. Treat yourself. Oh no.,Marshall
Poor. This is very bad.,Marshall
"Thank you, Stacy. Wesleyan has a cafeteria. Thank you to the generous donation of... Marshall arrives on camera, naked.",Girl
Oh! Oh! Someone there mentioned generous donation? I'm Marshall Eriksen. But you can call me Biercules!,Marshall
"Well, it could be anyone. And thin, I had forgotten this story Biercules.Who made this site first?",Lily
Pete Durkenson.,Marshall
Of course.,Ted
This is the guy who convinced you to run around campus naked?,Robin
"I wanted to join a club that I left three days later, because the clubs are stupid and elitist. And I also discovered that it was not a club.",Marshall
"Oh my God. This is huge! I am invited to the Ball of Architects, the annual gala honoring the greatest architects of the city. Oh no. You guys see the problem?",Ted
This is an annual gala that honors the greatest architects of the city?,Robin
"Robin, this is the biggest celebrity event of the year. In taking a girl at the ball, man, you reached third base. Whatever the girl I invite, it will be the steady girlfriend of Ted Mosby by the end of the evening. Ok, we stop to sit between two chairs. Robin, bring me my notebook. It's time to make lists of pros and cons.",Ted
Let me clarify something for you. I do not date guys who lie to me.,Nora
"Okay, I did not know. Mea culpa. So, from now, more lies. I never lie to you. I'm serious. Ask me anything.",Barney
OK Have you ever managed to get in bed with a woman that you lied?,Nora
Have I ever... If I'm totally honest... Yes.,Barney
More than once?,Nora
"More than once... Wow, this is... I guess if we... so, technically, there were a number of times I've lied to a woman to sleep with her.",Barney
They were worth what?,Nora
"Nine or ten for most. There has been a 4 once. It was an easy girl.But, Nora, after that, I had to flee so fast. Honesty is good.",Barney
What was the lie?,Nora
You want me to tell all the lies I have told to put a woman in my bed?,Barney
A bed or any other place where you're sent into the air.,Nora
You are good.,Barney
"Pete, Pete. Hey!",Marshall
"Biercules! Come here, man.",Pete
"Hey, I tried to call you all night.",Marshall
"My God, sorry. I should have responded but it was Thursday night.",Pete
It is Sunday.,Marshall
And you know what that means. Edward bottles with money!,Pete
"Ok, you know this old video of me?",Marshall
I watch it every day.,Pete
You have to take away the internet. Genre immediately.,Marshall
"There are two ways for me to do it: Either you give me $ 4 million, or help me to go to the bathroom because I can not...",Pete
"Yes, both are non-negotiable refusal.",Marshall
"So, I'm sorry we could not handle together. But if you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of the game to Edward bottles of money, and the competition is raised.",Pete
Who are you playing anyway?,Marshall
Just myself.,Pete
"I do not have time to explain how I got there. I just need someone to suck the poison. The surgeon gave me a new face, darling. You realize that I am alive? My name is David Beckham. If I castais only the white swan, is the role for you. No, I am a lesbian. What I wear is just very realistic.",Barney
"Ok, let's move. What was the worst? The best of the worst? The cream of the crop?",Nora
"Oh, once I am the soul man. There was this pretty girl who only go out with black.",Barney
"Barney! Oh no, I knew it.",Woman
I can not choose. They are both extraordinary.,Ted
"If architects had only two b*ll*ts, eh Ted?",Robin
"I knew it. Ted, left or right?",Lily
"Yes, yes, good idea. Let fate decide? I will choose the left.",Ted
"Ted, to your heart, you know that you love one more than the other.Believe me, takes the other.",Robin
"Uh, I have perhaps not been clear is the... Robin Ball Architects.This event is a very hip.",Ted
"Ok, name one celebrity who will be there.",Robin
Lenny Kravitz.,Ted
Lenny Kravitz will be there?,Robin
Yes. He is there every year. And it's a rock star.,Ted
"You know, Ted, in hindsight, it is too early to choose between these two girls. Takes a friend. Like, I dunno, maybe a friend who has a poster of Lenny Kravitz on his wall, and may or may not have dated this post and transported from his high school...",Robin
This list of pros and cons leads to nothing. I need a color scale.,Ted
"Pete, please. I am unemployed. I have a huge mortgage. A baby arriving. And I'm about to lose a job that I really need because of a drunken video of 15 years ago.",Marshall
"Ugh, you mean? Biercules, what's going on? Looks like you're another person. The guy in this video was cool. It had potential. It could have been president of a club one day.",Pete
There is no club.,Marshall
There he is just a troublemaker.,Pete
"It's not that I want to be a troublemaker. Fair, I must be one. I'll be a dad. You have children one day, you will understand.",Marshall
"Dude, I have 4 children.",Pete
"Pete, please, remove the video.",Marshall
"Ok, Biercules, I will remove it. If... you can b*at me to the game of my choice.",Pete
Oh no.,Marshall
"And I choose the beautiful game, the sweet science...",Pete
"Pete, please, I'm tired...",Marshall
The sport of kings...,Pete
I do not want to play Edward bottles money.,Marshall
"I was going to the darts, but it's Edward bottles to money!",Pete
"And that made all the lies related to space. Let the world of sports. Oh wait, I forgot for a space: I was bitten by a snake space. You have to suck all the poison around my... ",Barney
"Okay, Barney, I have things to work tomorrow at 8 am which means I have just enough time to spend 11h in my shower to wash away all that.",Nora
"So that was cool. I can remember, or...?",Barney
"Barney, you're funny, beautiful, and really nice. But you are also a sociopath.",Nora
"Well, I count three for and one against.",Barney
How can you still believe you have a chance with me?,Nora
"Because you are sat here all night. You could leave, but you did not. Listen, Nora, these lies, it was the old me. But I swear I try to change.You... make me want to change.",Barney
How I know this is not a lie?,Nora
I will prove it. I'll show you how much I'm serious. I will not leave this restaurant as I have not got a second date with you.,Barney
Goodbye Barney.,Nora
I do not laugh. It is a restaurant 24h/24. I will stay forever if necessary. And I will. Just water for me please.,Barney
"Ok, so the red bar indicates the level of attractiveness, blue, intellectual stimulation, green, emotional connection, yellow, compatibility aspirations of life, and purple, so she tried to pay or not.",Ted
"Well, it looks like Jessica wins in the first four categories.",Lily
Do not fight in...,Ted
"Oh, that? It's nothing. It cost me three months' rent, and uh, I have never worn because I bought it for a big party to which you would have asked what did not happen. But, you know what? Do not feel guilty.",Robin
What big event?,Ted
This thing with your uncle.,Robin
"His funeral? It fell into the water, he emerged miraculously from his coma.",Ted
And I forgive you. Now I can have my place and meet Lenny Kravitz?,Robin
I've done it again!,Marshall
"Oh, dear. You're still drunk. I can not believe that I made the bet.",Lily
"Just to be clear, I've done it again!... Am not referring to my current state of inebriation.",Marshall
What does it therefore reference?,Lily
"My name is Marshall Eriksen. I'm 33 and if my potential future employer, Garrison Cootes, look at this... Prostrate to Biercules!",Marshall
Well... it could be anyone...,Lily
"Oh, God...",Pete
"Pete, it's Lily Aldrin. I'll be brief. You're going out this video of Marshall. You know why? Because I am friends with three girls with whom you came to school, and girls say it all together. Every small detail.Huh. So... tick, tick... Pete so goes the clock in the little dick.",Lily
Pete has a small dick?,Ted
"I have no idea. Well, what do you take?",Lily
It had to happen eventually. I tried so hard to suppress my... side-idiot-who-is-not-care-for nothing he rebelled and has struggled!,Marshall
It's for sure!,Robin
"Who do I crazy? I'm not ready to be a father. I thought I was, but it's like... My father never did such things, you know?",Marshall
"But if he did, you would love all the same. And to be honest, you do not love to come across a video of him running down the street naked shouting, Hey, Marshall, look at me! I have a stalactite on the head! ",Lily
Oh! Hi guys! Oh! My neck! Uh... oh! Hey! Look at this!,Barney
"Barney, what are you doing here?",Robin
